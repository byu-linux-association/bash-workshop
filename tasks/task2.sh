# This is a little more involved than task1 but you should write
# code that should list everything in a directory but if it encounters
# a subdirectory, you should explore it and print everything there as well

#

# Hint 2: You cannot glob for a function call.
# Also checkout the man page of the test command. 
# You can do this with `man test`
