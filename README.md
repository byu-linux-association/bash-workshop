# Bash Workshop

You will find 3 tasks to complete in Bash in the tasks folder in this repo.

But to start, lets get Bash.

## Installation of Bash
If you are on MacOS or Linux, you already have Bash.

If you are on Windows, the easiest way is to install Git Bash.
You can do so at [this link.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Also, make sure to also install Git.

## Installation of Git
You will need Git to clone the repo. You could also download the source code from GitHub, but Git is an extremely useful tool. 
If you are a CS major then you will need to learn it at some point.

### For Linux
If you are on Linux, hopefully you know your package manager and how to install programs.

### For Windows
You should have installed Git with Git Bash above.

### For MacOS
You might already have it if you have ever installed XCode.
If not you can download it from [this link.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## How to complete the problems
Each task in `tasks` contains a script that explains how to do each task.
They also provide some tips on how to write the script as well as programs to use to help you complete the tasks.

To invoke one of the scripts in the command line, you would do `./task1.sh` for running task 1 if you are in the tasks folder.
If you are in the root of the repository, then you can do `/tasks/task1.sh` for running task 1.

You will need to use a text editor of some kind.
VSCode is great. Sublime is great. No idea about JetBrains.
Vim or Emacs is also great.

Good Luck!
