in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
1
2
and
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
and
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
1
3
and
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
1
4
and
god
saw
the
light
that
it
was
good
and
god
divided
the
light
from
the
darkness
1
5
and
god
called
the
light
day
and
the
darkness
he
called
night
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
1
6
and
god
said
let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters
1
7
and
god
made
the
firmament
and
divided
the
waters
which
were
under
the
firmament
from
the
waters
which
were
above
the
firmament
and
it
was
so
1
8
and
god
called
the
firmament
heaven
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
second
day
1
9
and
god
said
let
the
waters
under
the
heaven
be
gathered
together
unto
one
place
and
let
the
dry
land
appear
and
it
was
so
1
10
and
god
called
the
dry
land
earth
and
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
called
he
seas
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
1
11
and
god
said
let
the
earth
bring
forth
grass
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
fruit
tree
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind
whose
seed
is
in
itself
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
so
1
12
and
the
earth
brought
forth
grass
and
herb
yielding
seed
after
his
kind
and
the
tree
yielding
fruit
whose
seed
was
in
itself
after
his
kind
and

saw
that
it
was
good
1
13
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
third
day
1
14
and
god
said
let
there
be
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
divide
the
day
from
the
night
and
let
them
be
for
signs
and
for
seasons
and
for
days
and
years
1
15
and
let
them
be
for
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
so
1
16
and
god
made
two
great
lights
the
greater
light
to
rule
the
day
and
the
lesser
light
to
rule
the
night
he
made
the
stars
also
1
17
and
god
set
them
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
1
18
and
to
rule
over
the
day
and
over
the
night
and
to
divide
the
light
from
the
darkness
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
1
19
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fourth
day
1
20
and
god
said
let
the
waters
bring
forth
abundantly
the
moving
creature
that
hath
life
and
fowl
that
may
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven
1
21
and
god
created
great
whales
and
every
living
creature
that
moveth
which
the
waters
brought
forth
abundantly
after
their
kind
and
every
winged
fowl
after
his
kind
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
1
22
and
god
blessed
them
saying
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
fill
the
waters
in
the
seas
and
let
fowl
multiply
in
the
earth
1
23
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fifth
day
1
24
and
god
said
let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
cattle
and
creeping
thing
and
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
it
was
so
1
25
and
god
made
the
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
cattle
after
their
kind
and
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
1
26
and
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
1
27
so
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
male
and
female
created
he
them
1
28
and
god
blessed
them
and
god
said
unto
them
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
1
29
and
god
said
behold
i
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
in
the
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
yielding
seed
to
you
it
shall
be
for
meat
1
30
and
to
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
wherein
there
is
life
i
have
given
every
green
herb
for
meat
and
it
was
so
1
31
and
god
saw
every
thing
that
he
had
made
and
behold
it
was
very
good
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
sixth
day
2
1
thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
and
all
the
host
of
them
2
2
and
on
the
seventh
day
god
ended
his
work
which
he
had
made
and
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
work
which
he
had
made
2
3
and
god
blessed
the
seventh
day
and
sanctified
it
because
that
in
it
he
had
rested
from
all
his
work
which
god
created
and
made
2
4
these
are
the
generations
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
when
they
were
created
in
the
day
that
the
lord
god
made
the
earth
and
the
heavens
2
5
and
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
and
every
herb
of
the
field
before
it
grew
for
the
lord
god
had
not
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
and
there
was
not
a
man
to
till
the
ground
2
6
but
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
and
watered
the
whole
face
of
the
ground
2
7
and
the
lord
god
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
soul
2
8
and
the
lord
god
planted
a
garden
eastward
in
eden
and
there
he
put
the
man
whom
he
had
formed
2
9
and
out
of
the
ground
made
the
lord
god
to
grow
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food
the
tree
of
life
also
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
and
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
2
10
and
a
river
went
out
of
eden
to
water
the
garden
and
from
thence
it
was
parted
and
became
into
four
heads
2
11
the
name
of
the
first
is
pison
that
is
it
which
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
havilah
where
there
is
gold
2
12
and
the
gold
of
that
land
is
good
there
is
bdellium
and
the
onyx
stone
2
13
and
the
name
of
the
second
river
is
gihon
the
same
is
it
that
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
ethiopia
2
14
and
the
name
of
the
third
river
is
hiddekel
that
is
it
which
goeth
toward
the
east
of
assyria
and
the
fourth
river
is
euphrates
2
15
and
the
lord
god
took
the
man
and
put
him
into
the
garden
of
eden
to
dress
it
and
to
keep
it
2
16
and
the
lord
god
commanded
the
man
saying
of
every
tree
of
the
garden
thou
mayest
freely
eat
2
17
but
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
for
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
2
18
and
the
lord
god
said
it
is
not
good
that
the
man
should
be
alone
i
will
make
him
an
help
meet
for
him
2
19
and
out
of
the
ground
the
lord
god
formed
every
beast
of
the
field
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
brought
them
unto
adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
them
and
whatsoever
adam
called
every
living
creature
that
was
the
name
thereof
2
20
and
adam
gave
names
to
all
cattle
and
to
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
every
beast
of
the
field
but
for
adam
there
was
not
found
an
help
meet
for
him
2
21
and
the
lord
god
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
and
he
slept
and
he
took
one
of
his
ribs
and
closed
up
the
flesh
instead
thereof
2
22
and
the
rib
which
the
lord
god
had
taken
from
man
made
he
a
woman
and
brought
her
unto
the
man
2
23
and
adam
said
this
is
now
bone
of
my
bones
and
flesh
of
my
flesh
she
shall
be
called
woman
because
she
was
taken
out
of
man
2
24
therefore
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
and
shall
cleave
unto
his
wife
and
they
shall
be
one
flesh
2
25
and
they
were
both
naked
the
man
and
his
wife
and
were
not
ashamed
3
1
now
the
serpent
was
more
subtil
than
any
beast
of
the
field
which
the
lord
god
had
made
and
he
said
unto
the
woman
yea
hath
god
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
every
tree
of
the
garden
3
2
and
the
woman
said
unto
the
serpent
we
may
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
3
3
but
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
god
hath
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
it
neither
shall
ye
touch
it
lest
ye
die
3
4
and
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman
ye
shall
not
surely
die
3
5
for
god
doth
know
that
in
the
day
ye
eat
thereof
then
your
eyes
shall
be
opened
and
ye
shall
be
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
3
6
and
when
the
woman
saw
that
the
tree
was
good
for
food
and
that
it
was
pleasant
to
the
eyes
and
a
tree
to
be
desired
to
make
one
wise
she
took
of
the
fruit
thereof
and
did
eat
and
gave
also
unto
her
husband
with
her
and
he
did
eat
3
7
and
the
eyes
of
them
both
were
opened
and
they
knew
that
they
were
naked
and
they
sewed
fig
leaves
together
and
made
themselves
aprons
3
8
and
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
god
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
adam
and
his
wife
hid
themselves
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
god
amongst
the
trees
of
the
garden
3
9
and
the
lord
god
called
unto
adam
and
said
unto
him
where
art
thou
3
10
and
he
said
i
heard
thy
voice
in
the
garden
and
i
was
afraid
because
i
was
naked
and
i
hid
myself
3
11
and
he
said
who
told
thee
that
thou
wast
naked
hast
thou
eaten
of
the
tree
whereof
i
commanded
thee
that
thou
shouldest
not
eat
3
12
and
the
man
said
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
of
the
tree
and
i
did
eat
3
13
and
the
lord
god
said
unto
the
woman
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
and
the
woman
said
the
serpent
beguiled
me
and
i
did
eat
3
14
and
the
lord
god
said
unto
the
serpent
because
thou
hast
done
this
thou
art
cursed
above
all
cattle
and
above
every
beast
of
the
field
upon
thy
belly
shalt
thou
go
and
dust
shalt
thou
eat
all
the
days
of
thy
life
3
15
and
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
3
16
unto
the
woman
he
said
i
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
and
thy
conception
in
sorrow
thou
shalt
bring
forth
children
and
thy
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband
and
he
shall
rule
over
thee
3
17
and
unto
adam
he
said
because
thou
hast
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
thy
wife
and
hast
eaten
of
the
tree
of
which
i
commanded
thee
saying
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
cursed
is
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
3
18
thorns
also
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
herb
of
the
field
3
19
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
till
thou
return
unto
the
ground
for
out
of
it
wast
thou
taken
for
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
shalt
thou
return
3
20
and
adam
called
his
wife’s
name
eve
because
she
was
the
mother
of
all
living
3
21
unto
adam
also
and
to
his
wife
did
the
lord
god
make
coats
of
skins
and
clothed
them
3
22
and
the
lord
god
said
behold
the
man
is
become
as
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
and
now
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
for
ever
3
23
therefore
the
lord
god
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence

wherein
is
the
breath
of
life
from
under

and
every
thing
that
is
in
the
earth
shall
die
6
18
but
with
thee
will
i
establish
my
covenant
and
thou
shalt
come
into
the
ark

and
thy
sons
and
thy
wife
and

sons’
wives
with
thee
6
19
and
of
every
living
thing
of
all
flesh
two
of
every
sort

thou
bring

continually
and
after

he
had
made

which
went
forth
to

dried
up
from

8

also
he
sent

a
dove
from

to
see
if
the
waters
were
abated
from

8

but
the
dove
found
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
and
she
returned
unto
him
into
the
ark
for
the
waters
were
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
then
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
took
her
and
pulled
her
in
unto
him
into
the
ark
8
10
and
he
stayed
yet
other
seven
days
and
again
he
sent
forth
the
dove
out
of
the
ark
8
11
and
the
dove
came
in
to
him
in
the
evening
and
lo
in
her
mouth
was
an
olive
leaf
pluckt
off
so
noah
knew
that
the
waters
were
abated
from
off
the
earth
8
12
and
he
stayed
yet
other
seven
days
and
sent
forth
the
dove
which
returned
not
again
unto
him
any
more
8
13

removed
the
covering
of

and
looked
and

14
and
in

8
19
every
beast

and
whatsoever
creepeth
upon

went
forth
out
of

8
20
and
noah
builded
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
took

every
clean
beast
and
of
every
clean
fowl
and
offered
burnt
offerings
on

altar
8
21
and
the
lord
smelled
a
sweet
savour
and
the
lord
said
in
his
heart
i
will
not
again
curse
the
ground
any
more
for

cloud
and
it
shall
be
for
a
token
of
a
covenant
between
me
and

9
14
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
i
bring
a
cloud
over

earth
that
the
bow
shall
be
seen
in
the
cloud
9
15
and
i
will
remember
my
covenant
which
is
between
me
and
you

and
the
whole

language

speech
11

and
it
came
to

as
they
journeyed
from

that
they
found
a
plain
in

and
they
dwelt

whose
top
may
reach

let

make

and
the

came
down
to
see
the

and
the
tower
which
the
children
of
men
builded
11
6
and
the

said
behold
the
people
is
one
and
they
have
all
one
language
and
this
they
begin
to
do
and
now
nothing
will
be
restrained
from
them
which
they
have
imagined
to
do
11
7
go
to
let
us
go
down
and
there
confound
their
language
that
they
may
not
understand
one
another’s
speech
11

so
the
lord
scattered
them
abroad
from
thence
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
they
left
off
to
build
the
city
11
9
therefore

the
name
of
it
called
babel
because
the
lord
did
there
confound
the
language
of
all
the

and
from

and
the

12

now
the

said
unto

and

and
from

12

so
abram
departed
as
the
lord
had
spoken
unto
him
and
lot
went
with
him
and
abram
was
seventy
and
five
years
old
when
he
departed
out
of
haran
12
5
and
abram
took
sarai
his
wife
and
lot
his
brother’s
son
and
all
their
substance
that
they
had
gathered
and
the
souls
that
they
had

and
they
went
forth
to
go
into
the
land
of

and
into
the
land
of

they
came
12
6
and
abram
passed
through
the
land
unto
the
place
of
sichem
unto
the
plain
of
moreh
and
the
canaanite
was
then
in
the
land
12
7
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
abram
and
said
unto
thy
seed
will
i
give
this
land
and
there
builded
he
an
altar
unto
the
lord
who
appeared
unto
him
12
8
and
he
removed
from
thence
unto
a
mountain
on
the
east
of
bethel
and
pitched
his
tent
having
bethel
on
the
west
and
hai
on
the
east
and
there
he
builded
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
12
9
and
abram
journeyed
going
on
still
toward
the
south
12
10
and
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land
and
abram
went
down
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
for
the
famine
was
grievous
in
the
land
12
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
near
to
enter
into
egypt
that
he
said
unto
sarai
his
wife
behold
now
i
know
that
thou
art
a
fair
woman
to
look
upon
12
12
therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
egyptians
shall
see
thee
that
they
shall
say
this
is
his
wife
and
they
will
kill
me
but
they
will
save
thee
alive
12
13
say
i
pray
thee
thou
art
my
sister
that
it
may
be
well
with
me
for
thy
sake
and
my
soul
shall
live
because
of
thee
12
14
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
abram
was
come
into
egypt
the
egyptians
beheld
the
woman
that
she
was
very
fair
12
15
the
princes
also
of
pharaoh
saw
her
and
commended
her
before
pharaoh
and
the
woman
was
taken
into
pharaoh’s
house
12
16
and
he
entreated
abram
well
for
her
sake
and
he
had
sheep
and
oxen
and
he
asses
and
menservants
and
maidservants
and
she
asses
and
camels
12
17
and
the
lord
plagued
pharaoh
and
his
house
with
great
plagues
because
of
sarai
abram’s
wife
12
18
and
pharaoh
called
abram
and
said
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me
why
didst
thou
not
tell
me
that
she
was
thy
wife
12
19
why
saidst
thou
she
is
my
sister
so
i
might
have
taken
her
to
me
to
wife
now
therefore
behold
thy
wife
take
her
and
go
thy
way
12
20
and
pharaoh
commanded
his
men
concerning
him
and
they
sent
him
away
and
his
wife
and
all
that
he
had
13
1
and
abram
went
up
out
of
egypt
he
and
his
wife
and
all
that
he
had
and
lot
with
him
into
the
south
13
2
and
abram
was
very
rich
in
cattle
in
silver
and
in
gold
13
3
and
he
went
on
his
journeys
from
the
south
even
to
bethel
unto
the
place
where
his
tent
had
been
at
the
beginning
between
bethel
and
hai
13
4
unto
the
place
of
the
altar
which
he
had
made
there
at
the
first
and
there
abram
called
on
the
name
of
the
lord
13
5
and
lot
also
which
went
with
abram
had
flocks
and
herds
and
tents
13
6
and
the
land
was
not
able
to
bear
them
that
they
might
dwell
together
for
their
substance
was
great
so
that
they
could
not
dwell
together
13
7
and
there
was
a
strife
between
the
herdmen
of
abram’s
cattle
and
the
herdmen
of
lot’s
cattle
and
the
canaanite
and
the
perizzite
dwelled
then
in
the
land
13
8
and
abram
said
unto
lot
let
there
be
no
strife
i
pray
thee
between
me
and
thee
and
between
my
herdmen
and
thy
herdmen
for
we
be
brethren
13
9
is
not
the
whole
land
before
thee
separate
thyself
i
pray
thee
from
me
if
thou
wilt
take
the
left
hand
then
i
will
go
to
the
right
or
if
thou
depart
to
the
right
hand
then
i
will
go
to
the
left
13
10
and
lot
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
beheld
all
the
plain
of
jordan
that
it
was
well
watered
every
where
before
the
lord
destroyed
sodom
and
gomorrah
even
as
the
garden
of
the
lord
like
the
land
of
egypt
as
thou
comest
unto
zoar
13
11
then
lot
chose
him
all
the
plain
of
jordan
and
lot
journeyed
east
and
they
separated
themselves
the
one
from
the
other
13
12
abram
dwelled
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
lot
dwelled
in
the
cities
of
the
plain
and
pitched
his
tent
toward
sodom
13
13
but
the
men
of
sodom
were
wicked
and
sinners
before
the
lord
exceedingly
13
14
and
the
lord
said
unto
abram
after
that
lot
was
separated
from
him
lift
up
now
thine
eyes
and
look
from
the
place
where
thou
art
northward
and
southward
and
eastward
and
westward
13
15
for
all
the
land
which
thou
seest
to
thee
will
i
give
it
and
to
thy
seed
for
ever
13
16
and
i
will
make
thy
seed
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
so
that
if
a
man
can
number
the
dust
of
the
earth
then
shall
thy
seed
also
be
numbered
13
17
arise
walk
through
the
land
in
the
length
of
it
and
in
the
breadth
of
it
for
i
will
give
it
unto
thee
13
18
then
abram
removed
his
tent
and
came
and
dwelt
in
the
plain
of
mamre
which
is
in
hebron
and
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
14

and
it
came
to

all
these
were
joined
together
in
the
vale
of
siddim
which
is
the
salt

14
4
twelve
years
they
served
chedorlaomer
and
in
the
thirteenth
year
they
rebelled
14
5
and
in
the
fourteenth
year
came
chedorlaomer
and
the
kings
that

him
and
smote
the

14

and
the
horites
in
their
mount
seir
unto
elparan
which
is
by
the

14
7
and
they
returned
and
came
to
enmishpat
which
is

and
smote
all
the
country
of
the
amalekites
and
also
the

and
the
king
of
admah
and
the
king

and
the

(the

and
they
joined

with
them
in

14

with

the
king

and
with

and
amraphel
king
of

and
arioch
king
of

four
kings
with
five
14
10
and
the
vale
of

was
full
of
slimepits
and
the
kings
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
fled
and
fell
there
and
they
that

fled
to

14
11
and
they
took
all
the
goods
of

and
all
their

and
went
their

14
12
and
they
took

abram’s
brother’s
son
who
dwelt
in

and
his
goods
and
departed
14
13
and
there
came
one

the
hebrew
for
he
dwelt
in
the

the
amorite
brother
of
eshcol
and
brother
of

and
these
were
confederate
with
abram
14
14
and
when
abram
heard
that
his
brother
was
taken
captive
he
armed
his
trained
servants
born
in
his
own
house
three
hundred
and
eighteen
and
pursued
them
unto

14
15
and
he
divided

and
smote
them
and
pursued
them
unto

14
16
and
he
brought

and
also
brought

and
the
women
also
and
the

14
17
and
the
king
of

went
out
to
meet
him
after
his
return
from
the
slaughter
of

and
of
the

14
18
and

and
he
was
the
priest
of
the
most

14
19
and
he
blessed
him
and
said
blessed

and
earth
14
20
and
blessed

most
high
god
which

hand
and
he
gave
him
tithes
of

14
21
and
the
king
of
sodom
said
unto
abram
give
me
the
persons
and
take
the
goods
to
thyself
14
22
and
abram
said
to
the
king
of

i
have
lift
up
mine
hand
unto
the
lord
the
most
high
god
the
possessor
of
heaven
and
earth
14
23
that
i
will
not
take
from
a
thread
even
to
a
shoelatchet
and
that
i
will
not
take
any
thing
that
is
thine
lest
thou
shouldest
say
i
have
made
abram
rich
14
24
save
only
that
which
the
young
men
have
eaten
and
the
portion
of
the
men
which
went
with
me
aner
eshcol
and
mamre
let
them
take
their
portion
15
1
after
these
things
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
abram
in
a
vision
saying
fear
not
abram
i
am
thy
shield
and
thy
exceeding
great
reward
15
2
and
abram
said
lord
god
what
wilt
thou
give
me
seeing
i
go
childless
and
the
steward
of
my
house
is
this
eliezer
of
damascus
15
3
and
abram
said
behold
to
me
thou
hast
given
no
seed
and
lo
one
born
in
my
house
is
mine
heir
15
4
and
behold
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
this
shall
not
be
thine
heir
but
he
that
shall
come
forth
out
of
thine
own
bowels
shall
be
thine
heir
15
5
and
he
brought
him
forth
abroad
and
said
look
now
toward
heaven
and
tell
the
stars
if
thou
be
able
to
number
them
and
he
said
unto
him
so
shall
thy
seed
be
15
6
and
he
believed
in
the
lord
and
he
counted
it
to
him
for
righteousness
15
7
and
he
said
unto
him
i
am
the
lord
that
brought
thee
out
of
ur
of
the
chaldees
to
give
thee
this
land
to
inherit
it
15
8
and
he
said
lord
god
whereby
shall
i
know
that
i
shall
inherit
it
15
9
and
he
said
unto
him
take
me
an
heifer
of
three
years
old
and
a
she
goat
of
three
years
old
and
a
ram
of
three
years
old
and
a
turtledove
and
a
young
pigeon
15
10
and
he
took
unto
him
all
these
and
divided
them
in
the
midst
and
laid
each
piece
one
against
another
but
the
birds
divided
he
not
15
11
and
when
the
fowls
came
down
upon
the
carcases
abram
drove
them
away
15
12
and
when
the
sun
was
going
down
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
abram
and
lo
an
horror
of
great
darkness
fell
upon
him
15
13
and
he
said
unto
abram
know
of
a
surety
that
thy
seed
shall
be
a
stranger
in
a
land
that
is
not
theirs
and
shall
serve
them
and
they
shall
afflict
them
four
hundred
years
15
14
and
also
that
nation
whom
they
shall
serve
will
i
judge
and
afterward
shall
they
come
out
with
great
substance
15
15
and
thou
shalt
go
to
thy
fathers
in
peace
thou
shalt
be
buried
in
a
good
old
age
15
16
but
in
the
fourth
generation
they
shall
come
hither
again
for
the
iniquity
of
the
amorites
is
not
yet
full
15
17
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
sun
went
down
and
it
was
dark
behold
a
smoking
furnace
and
a
burning
lamp
that
passed
between
those
pieces
15
18
in
the
same
day
the
lord
made
a
covenant
with
abram
saying
unto
thy
seed
have
i
given
this
land
from
the
river
of
egypt
unto
the
great
river
the
river
euphrates
15
19
the
kenites
and
the
kenizzites
and
the
kadmonites
15
20
and
the
hittites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
rephaims
15
21
and
the
amorites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
girgashites
and
the
jebusites
16
1
now
sarai
abram’s
wife
bare
him
no
children
and
she
had
an
handmaid
an
egyptian
whose
name
was
hagar
16
2
and
sarai
said
unto
abram
behold
now
the
lord
hath
restrained
me
from
bearing
i
pray
thee
go
in
unto
my
maid
it
may
be
that
i
may
obtain
children
by
her
and
abram
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
sarai
16
3
and
sarai
abram’s
wife
took
hagar
her
maid
the
egyptian
after
abram
had
dwelt
ten
years
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
gave
her
to
her
husband
abram
to
be
his
wife
16
4
and
he
went
in
unto
hagar
and
she
conceived
and
when
she
saw
that
she
had
conceived
her
mistress
was
despised
in
her
eyes
16
5
and
sarai
said
unto
abram
my
wrong
be
upon
thee
i
have
given
my
maid
into
thy
bosom
and
when
she
saw
that
she
had
conceived
i
was
despised
in
her
eyes
the
lord
judge
between
me
and
thee
16
6
but
abram
said
unto
sarai
behold
thy
maid
is
in
thine
hand
do
to
her
as
it
pleaseth
thee
and
when
sarai
dealt
hardly
with
her
she
fled
from
her
face
16
7
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
found
her
by
a
fountain
of
water
in
the
wilderness
by
the
fountain
in
the
way

said
unto

16
and

and
six
years
old
when

17

and
when

the

appeared
to

and
said
unto

17
2
and
i
will
make

me
and
thee
and
will
multiply
thee
exceedingly
17
3
and
abram
fell
on
his
face
and
god
talked
with
him
saying
17
4
as
for
me
behold
my
covenant
is
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
a
father
of

17
5
neither

but

shall
be
abraham
for
a
father
of
many
nations
have
i
made
thee
17
6
and
i
will
make
thee
exceeding
fruitful
and
i
will
make
nations
of
thee
and
kings
shall
come
out
of
thee
17
7
and
i
will
establish
my
covenant
between
me
and
thee
and
thy
seed
after
thee
in
their
generations
for
an
everlasting
covenant
to
be
a
god
unto
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
17
8
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
the
land
wherein
thou
art
a
stranger
all
the
land
of
canaan
for
an
everlasting
possession
and
i
will
be
their
god
17
9
and
god
said
unto
abraham
thou
shalt
keep
my
covenant
therefore
thou
and
thy
seed
after
thee
in
their
generations
17
10
this
is
my
covenant
which
ye
shall
keep
between
me
and
you
and
thy
seed
after
thee
every
man
child
among
you
shall
be
circumcised
17
11
and
ye
shall
circumcise
the
flesh
of
your
foreskin
and
it
shall
be
a
token
of
the
covenant
betwixt
me
and
you
17
12
and
he
that
is
eight
days
old
shall
be
circumcised
among
you
every
man
child
in
your
generations
he
that
is
born
in
the
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
seed
17
13
he
that
is
born
in
thy
house
and
he
that
is
bought
with
thy
money
must
needs
be
circumcised
and
my
covenant
shall
be
in
your
flesh
for
an
everlasting
covenant
17
14
and
the
uncircumcised
man
child
whose
flesh
of
his
foreskin
is
not
circumcised
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
people
he
hath
broken
my
covenant
17
15
and
god
said
unto
abraham
as
for
sarai
thy
wife
thou
shalt
not
call
her
name
sarai
but
sarah
shall
her
name
be
17
16
and
i
will
bless
her
and
give
thee
a
son
also
of
her
yea
i
will
bless
her
and
she
shall
be
a
mother
of
nations
kings
of
people
shall
be
of
her
17
17
then
abraham
fell
upon
his
face
and
laughed
and
said
in
his
heart
shall
a
child
be
born
unto
him
that
is
an
hundred
years
old
and
shall
sarah
that
is
ninety
years
old
bear
17
18
and
abraham
said
unto
god
o
that
ishmael
might
live
before
thee
17
19
and
god
said
sarah
thy
wife
shall
bear
thee
a
son
indeed
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
isaac
and
i
will
establish
my
covenant
with
him
for
an
everlasting
covenant
and
with
his
seed
after
him
17
20
and
as
for
ishmael
i
have
heard
thee
behold
i
have
blessed
him
and
will
make
him
fruitful
and
will
multiply
him
exceedingly
twelve
princes
shall
he
beget
and
i
will
make
him
a
great
nation
17
21
but
my
covenant
will
i
establish
with
isaac
which
sarah
shall
bear
unto
thee
at
this
set
time
in
the
next
year
17
22
and
he
left
off
talking
with
him
and
god
went
up
from
abraham
17
23
and
abraham
took
ishmael
his
son
and
all
that
were
born
in
his
house
and
all
that
were
bought
with
his
money
every
male
among
the
men
of
abraham’s
house
and
circumcised
the
flesh
of
their
foreskin
in
the
selfsame
day
as
god
had
said
unto
him
17
24
and
abraham
was
ninety
years
old
and
nine
when
he
was
circumcised
in
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
17
25
and
ishmael
his
son
was
thirteen
years
old
when
he
was
circumcised
in
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
17
26
in
the
selfsame
day
was
abraham
circumcised
and
ishmael
his
son
17
27
and
all
the
men
of
his
house
born
in
the
house
and
bought
with
money
of
the
stranger
were
circumcised
with
him
18
1
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
the
plains
of
mamre
and
he
sat
in
the
tent
door
in
the
heat
of
the
day
18
2
and
he
lift
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
lo
three
men
stood
by
him
and
when
he
saw
them
he
ran
to
meet
them
from
the
tent
door
and
bowed
himself
toward
the
ground
18
3
and
said
my
lord
if
now
i
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
pass
not
away
i
pray
thee
from
thy
servant
18
4
let
a
little
water
i
pray
you
be
fetched
and
wash
your
feet
and
rest
yourselves
under
the
tree
18
5
and
i
will
fetch
a
morsel
of
bread
and
comfort
ye
your
hearts
after
that
ye
shall
pass
on
for
therefore
are
ye
come
to
your
servant
and
they
said
so
do
as
thou
hast
said
18
6
and
abraham
hastened
into
the
tent
unto
sarah
and
said
make
ready
quickly
three
measures
of
fine
meal
knead
it
and
make
cakes
upon
the
hearth
18
7
and
abraham
ran
unto
the
herd
and
fetcht
a
calf
tender
and
good
and
gave
it
unto
a
young
man
and
he
hasted
to
dress
it
18
8
and
he
took
butter
and
milk
and
the
calf
which
he
had
dressed
and
set
it
before
them
and
he
stood
by
them
under
the
tree
and
they
did
eat
18
9
and
they
said
unto
him
where
is
sarah
thy
wife
and
he
said
behold
in
the
tent
18
10
and
he
said
i
will
certainly
return
unto
thee
according
to
the
time
of
life
and
lo
sarah
thy
wife
shall
have
a
son
and
sarah
heard
it
in
the
tent
door
which
was
behind
him
18
11
now
abraham
and
sarah
were
old
and
well
stricken
in
age
and
it
ceased
to
be
with
sarah
after
the
manner
of
women
18
12
therefore
sarah
laughed
within
herself
saying
after
i
am
waxed
old
shall
i
have
pleasure
my
lord
being
old
also
18
13
and
the
lord
said
unto
abraham
wherefore
did
sarah
laugh
saying
shall
i
of
a
surety
bear
a
child
which
am
old
18
14
is
any
thing
too
hard
for
the
lord
at
the
time
appointed
i
will
return
unto
thee
according
to
the
time
of
life
and
sarah
shall
have
a
son
18
15
then
sarah
denied
saying
i
laughed
not
for
she
was
afraid
and
he
said
nay
but
thou
didst
laugh
18
16
and
the
men
rose
up
from
thence
and
looked
toward
sodom
and
abraham
went
with
them
to
bring
them
on
the
way
18
17
and
the
lord
said
shall
i
hide
from
abraham
that
thing
which
i
do
18
18
seeing
that
abraham
shall
surely
become
a
great
and
mighty
nation
and
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
shall
be
blessed
in
him
18
19
for
i
know
him
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
him
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
do
justice
and
judgment
that
the
lord
may
bring
upon
abraham
that
which
he
hath
spoken
of
him
18
20
and
the
lord
said
because
the
cry
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
is
great
and
because
their
sin
is
very
grievous
18
21
i
will
go
down
now
and
see
whether
they
have
done
altogether
according
to
the
cry
of
it
which
is
come
unto
me
and
if
not
i
will
know
18
22
and
the
men
turned
their
faces
from
thence
and
went
toward
sodom
but
abraham
stood
yet
before
the
lord
18
23
and
abraham
drew
near
and
said
wilt
thou
also
destroy
the
righteous
with
the
wicked
18
24
peradventure
there
be
fifty
righteous
within
the
city
wilt
thou
also
destroy
and
not
spare
the
place
for
the
fifty
righteous
that
are
therein
18
25
that
be
far
from
thee
to
do
after
this
manner
to
slay
the
righteous
with
the
wicked
and
that
the
righteous
should
be
as
the
wicked
that
be
far
from
thee
shall
not
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
do
right
18
26
and
the
lord
said
if
i
find
in
sodom
fifty
righteous
within
the
city
then
i
will
spare
all
the
place
for
their
sakes
18
27
and
abraham
answered
and
said
behold
now
i
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
lord
which
am
but
dust
and
ashes
18
28
peradventure
there
shall
lack
five
of
the
fifty
righteous
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
city
for
lack
of
five
and
he
said
if
i
find
there
forty
and
five
i
will
not
destroy
it
18
29
and
he
spake
unto
him
yet
again
and
said
peradventure
there
shall
be
forty
found
there
and
he
said
i
will
not
do
it
for
forty’s
sake
18
30
and
he
said
unto
him
oh
let
not
the
lord
be
angry
and
i
will
speak
peradventure
there
shall
thirty
be
found
there
and
he
said
i
will
not
do
it
if
i
find
thirty
there
18
31
and
he
said
behold
now
i
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
lord
peradventure
there
shall
be
twenty
found
there
and
he
said
i
will
not
destroy
it
for
twenty’s
sake
18
32
and
he
said
oh
let
not
the
lord
be
angry
and
i
will
speak
yet
but
this
once
peradventure
ten
shall
be
found
there
and
he
said
i
will
not
destroy
it
for
ten’s
sake
18
33
and
the
lord
went
his
way
as
soon
as
he
had
left
communing
with
abraham
and
abraham
returned
unto
his
place
19
1
and
there
came
two
angels
to
sodom
at
even
and
lot
sat
in
the
gate
of
sodom
and
lot
seeing
them
rose
up
to
meet
them
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
toward
the
ground
19
2
and
he
said
behold
now
my
lords
turn
in
i
pray
you
into
your
servant’s
house
and
tarry
all
night
and
wash
your
feet
and
ye
shall
rise
up
early
and
go
on
your
ways
and
they
said
nay
but
we
will
abide
in
the
street
all
night
19
3
and
he
pressed
upon
them
greatly
and
they
turned
in
unto
him
and
entered
into
his
house
and
he
made
them
a
feast
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
and
they
did
eat
19
4
but
before
they
lay
down
the
men
of
the
city
even
the
men
of
sodom
compassed
the
house
round
both
old
and
young
all
the
people
from
every
quarter
19
5
and
they
called
unto
lot
and
said
unto
him
where
are
the
men
which
came
in
to
thee
this
night
bring
them
out
unto
us
that
we
may
know
them
19
6
and
lot
went
out
at
the
door
unto
them
and
shut
the
door
after
him
19
7
and
said
i
pray
you
brethren
do
not
so
wickedly
19
8
behold
now
i
have
two
daughters
which
have
not
known
man
let
me
i
pray
you
bring
them
out
unto
you
and
do
ye
to
them
as
is
good
in
your
eyes
only
unto
these
men
do
nothing
for
therefore
came
they
under
the
shadow
of
my
roof
19
9
and
they
said
stand
back
and
they
said
again
this
one
fellow
came
in
to
sojourn
and
he
will
needs
be
a
judge
now
will
we
deal
worse
with
thee
than
with
them
and
they
pressed
sore
upon
the
man
even
lot
and
came
near
to
break
the
door
19
10
but
the
men
put
forth
their
hand
and
pulled
lot
into
the
house
to
them
and
shut
to
the
door
19
11
and
they
smote
the
men
that
were
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
blindness
both
small
and
great
so
that
they
wearied
themselves
to
find
the
door
19
12
and
the
men
said
unto
lot
hast
thou
here
any
besides
son
in
law
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
and
whatsoever
thou
hast
in
the
city
bring
them
out
of
this
place
19
13
for
we
will
destroy
this
place
because
the
cry
of
them
is
waxen
great
before
the
face
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
hath
sent
us
to
destroy
it
19
14
and
lot
went
out
and
spake
unto
his
sons
in
law
which
married
his
daughters
and
said
up
get
you
out
of
this
place
for
the
lord
will
destroy
this
city
but
he
seemed
as
one
that
mocked
unto
his
sons
in
law
19
15
and
when
the
morning
arose
then
the
angels
hastened
lot
saying
arise
take
thy
wife
and
thy
two
daughters
which
are
here
lest
thou
be
consumed
in
the
iniquity
of
the
city
19
16
and
while
he
lingered
the
men
laid
hold
upon
his
hand
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
wife
and
upon
the
hand
of
his
two
daughters
the
lord
being
merciful
unto
him
and
they
brought
him
forth
and
set
him
without
the
city
19
17
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
brought
them
forth
abroad
that
he
said
escape
for
thy
life
look
not
behind
thee
neither
stay
thou
in
all
the
plain
escape
to
the
mountain
lest
thou
be
consumed
19
18
and
lot
said
unto
them
oh
not
so
my
lord
19
19
behold
now
thy
servant
hath
found
grace
in
thy
sight
and
thou
hast
magnified
thy
mercy
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
me
in
saving
my
life
and
i
cannot
escape
to
the
mountain
lest
some
evil
take
me
and
i
die
19
20
behold
now
this
city
is
near
to
flee
unto
and
it
is
a
little
one
oh
let
me
escape
thither
(is
it
not
a
little
one
)
and
my
soul
shall
live

21
and
he
said
unto
him
see
i
have
accepted
thee
concerning
this
thing
also
that
i
will
not
overthrow
this
city
for
the
which
thou
hast
spoken
19
22
haste
thee
escape
thither
for
i
cannot
do
anything
till
thou
be
come
thither
therefore
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
zoar
19
23
the
sun
was
risen
upon
the
earth
when
lot
entered
into
zoar
19
24
then
the
lord
rained
upon
sodom
and
upon
gomorrah
brimstone
and
fire
from
the
lord
out
of
heaven
19
25
and
he
overthrew
those
cities
and
all
the
plain
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
and
that
which
grew
upon
the
ground
19
26
but
his
wife
looked
back
from
behind
him
and
she
became
a
pillar
of
salt
19
27
and
abraham
gat
up
early
in
the
morning
to
the
place
where
he
stood
before
the
lord
19
28
and
he
looked
toward
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
toward
all
the
land
of
the
plain
and
beheld
and
lo
the
smoke
of
the
country
went
up
as
the
smoke
of
a
furnace
19
29
and
it
came
to
pass
when
god
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
plain
that
god
remembered
abraham
and
sent
lot
out
of
the
midst
of
the
overthrow
when
he
overthrew
the
cities
in
the
which
lot
dwelt
19
30
and
lot
went
up
out
of
zoar
and
dwelt
in
the
mountain
and
his
two
daughters
with
him
for
he
feared
to
dwell
in
zoar
and
he
dwelt
in
a
cave
he
and
his
two
daughters
19
31
and
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
younger
our
father
is
old
and
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
earth
to
come
in
unto
us
after
the
manner
of
all
the
earth
19
32
come
let
us
make
our
father
drink
wine
and
we
will
lie
with
him
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
father
19
33
and
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
and
the
firstborn
went
in
and
lay
with
her
father
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
down
nor
when
she
arose
19
34
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
younger
behold
i
lay
yesternight
with
my
father
let
us
make
him
drink
wine
this
night
also
and
go
thou
in
and
lie
with
him
that
we
may
preserve
seed
of
our
father
19
35
and
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
also
and
the
younger
arose
and
lay
with
him
and
he
perceived
not
when
she
lay
down
nor
when
she
arose
19
36
thus
were
both
the
daughters
of
lot
with
child
by
their
father
19
37
and
the
first
born
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
moab
the
same
is
the
father
of
the
moabites
unto
this
day
19
38
and
the
younger
she
also
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
benammi
the
same
is
the
father
of
the
children
of
ammon
unto
this
day
20
1
and
abraham
journeyed
from
thence
toward
the
south
country
and
dwelled
between
kadesh
and
shur
and
sojourned
in
gerar
20
2
and
abraham
said
of
sarah
his
wife
she
is
my
sister
and
abimelech
king
of
gerar
sent
and
took
sarah
20
3
but
god
came
to
abimelech
in
a
dream
by
night
and
said
to
him
behold
thou
art
but
a
dead
man
for
the
woman
which
thou
hast
taken
for
she
is
a
man’s
wife
20
4
but
abimelech
had
not
come
near
her
and
he
said
lord
wilt
thou
slay
also
a
righteous
nation
20
5
said
he
not
unto
me
she
is
my
sister
and
she
even
she
herself
said
he
is
my
brother
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
and
innocency
of
my
hands
have
i
done
this
20
6
and
god
said
unto
him
in
a
dream
yea
i
know
that
thou
didst
this
in
the
integrity
of
thy
heart
for
i
also
withheld
thee
from
sinning
against
me
therefore
suffered
i
thee
not
to
touch
her
20
7
now
therefore
restore
the
man
his
wife
for
he
is
a
prophet
and
he
shall
pray
for
thee
and
thou
shalt
live
and
if
thou
restore
her
not
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thou
and
all
that
are
thine
20
8
therefore
abimelech
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
called
all
his
servants
and
told
all
these
things
in
their
ears
and
the
men
were
sore
afraid
20
9
then
abimelech
called
abraham
and
said
unto
him
what
hast
thou
done
unto
us
and
what
have
i
offended
thee
that
thou
hast
brought
on
me
and
on
my
kingdom
a
great
sin
thou
hast
done
deeds
unto
me
that
ought
not
to
be
done
20
10
and
abimelech
said
unto
abraham
what
sawest
thou
that
thou
hast
done
this
thing
20
11
and
abraham
said
because
i
thought
surely
the
fear
of
god
is
not
in
this
place
and
they
will
slay
me
for
my
wife’s
sake
20
12
and
yet
indeed
she
is
my
sister
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
father
but
not
the
daughter
of
my
mother
and
she
became
my
wife
20
13
and
it
came
to
pass
when
god
caused
me
to
wander
from
my
father’s
house
that
i
said
unto
her
this
is
thy
kindness
which
thou
shalt
shew
unto
me
at
every
place
whither
we
shall
come
say
of
me
he
is
my
brother
20
14
and
abimelech
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
menservants
and
womenservants
and
gave
them
unto
abraham
and
restored
him
sarah
his
wife
20
15
and
abimelech
said
behold
my
land
is
before
thee
dwell
where
it
pleaseth
thee
20
16
and
unto
sarah
he
said
behold
i
have
given
thy
brother
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver
behold
he
is
to
thee
a
covering
of
the
eyes
unto
all
that
are
with
thee
and
with
all
other
thus
she
was
reproved
20
17
so
abraham
prayed
unto
god
and
god
healed
abimelech
and
his
wife
and
his
maidservants
and
they
bare
children
20
18
for
the
lord
had
fast
closed
up
all
the
wombs
of
the
house
of
abimelech
because
of
sarah
abraham’s
wife
21
1
and
the
lord
visited
sarah
as
he
had
said
and
the
lord
did
unto
sarah
as
he
had
spoken
21
2
for
sarah
conceived
and
bare
abraham
a
son
in
his
old
age
at
the
set
time
of
which
god
had
spoken
to
him
21
3
and
abraham
called
the
name
of
his
son
that
was
born
unto
him
whom
sarah
bare
to
him
isaac
21
4
and
abraham
circumcised
his
son
isaac
being
eight
days
old
as
god
had
commanded
him
21
5
and
abraham
was
an
hundred
years
old
when
his
son
isaac
was
born
unto
him
21
6
and
sarah
said
god
hath
made
me
to
laugh
so
that
all
that
hear
will
laugh
with
me
21
7
and
she
said
who
would
have
said
unto
abraham
that
sarah
should
have
given
children
suck
for
i
have
born
him
a
son
in
his
old
age
21
8
and
the
child
grew
and
was
weaned
and
abraham
made
a
great
feast
the
same
day
that
isaac
was
weaned
21
9
and
sarah
saw
the
son
of
hagar
the
egyptian
which
she
had
born
unto
abraham
mocking
21
10
wherefore
she
said
unto
abraham
cast
out
this
bondwoman
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
this
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
my
son
even
with
isaac
21
11
and
the
thing
was
very
grievous
in
abraham’s
sight
because
of
his
son
21
12
and
god
said
unto
abraham
let
it
not
be
grievous
in
thy
sight
because
of
the
lad
and
because
of
thy
bondwoman
in
all
that
sarah
hath
said
unto
thee
hearken
unto
her
voice
for
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
21
13
and
also
of
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
will
i
make
a
nation
because
he
is
thy
seed
21
14
and
abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
took
bread
and
a
bottle
of
water
and
gave
it
unto
hagar
putting
it
on
her
shoulder
and
the
child
and
sent
her
away
and
she
departed
and
wandered
in
the
wilderness
of
beersheba
21
15
and
the
water
was
spent
in
the
bottle
and
she
cast
the
child
under
one
of
the
shrubs
21
16
and
she
went
and
sat
her
down
over
against
him
a
good
way
off
as
it
were
a
bow
shot
for
she
said
let
me
not
see
the
death
of
the
child
and
she
sat
over
against
him
and
lift
up
her
voice
and
wept
21
17
and
god
heard
the
voice
of
the
lad
and
the
angel
of
god
called
to
hagar
out
of
heaven
and
said
unto
her
what
aileth
thee
hagar
fear
not
for
god
hath
heard
the
voice
of
the
lad
where
he
is
21
18
arise
lift
up
the
lad
and
hold
him
in
thine
hand
for
i
will
make
him
a
great
nation
21
19
and
god
opened
her
eyes
and
she
saw
a
well
of
water
and
she
went
and
filled
the
bottle
with
water
and
gave
the
lad
drink
21
20
and
god
was
with
the
lad
and
he
grew
and
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
and
became
an
archer
21
21
and
he
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
of
paran
and
his
mother
took
him
a
wife
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
21
22
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
that
abimelech
and
phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
host
spake
unto
abraham
saying
god
is
with
thee
in
all
that
thou
doest
21
23
now
therefore
swear
unto
me
here
by
god
that
thou
wilt
not
deal
falsely
with
me
nor
with
my
son
nor
with
my
son’s
son
but
according
to
the
kindness
that
i
have
done
unto
thee
thou
shalt
do
unto
me
and
to
the
land
wherein
thou
hast
sojourned
21
24
and
abraham
said
i
will
swear
21
25
and
abraham
reproved
abimelech
because
of
a
well
of
water
which
abimelech’s
servants
had
violently
taken
away
21
26
and
abimelech
said
i
wot
not
who
hath
done
this
thing
neither
didst
thou
tell
me
neither
yet
heard
i
of
it
but
to
day
21
27
and
abraham
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
gave
them
unto
abimelech
and
both
of
them
made
a
covenant
21
28
and
abraham
set
seven
ewe
lambs
of
the
flock
by
themselves
21
29
and
abimelech
said
unto
abraham
what
mean
these
seven
ewe
lambs
which
thou
hast
set
by
themselves
21
30
and
he
said
for
these
seven
ewe
lambs
shalt
thou
take
of
my
hand
that
they
may
be
a
witness
unto
me
that
i
have
digged
this
well
21
31
wherefore
he
called
that
place
beersheba
because
there
they
sware
both
of
them
21
32
thus
they
made
a
covenant
at
beersheba
then
abimelech
rose
up
and
phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
host
and
they
returned
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
21
33
and
abraham
planted
a
grove
in
beersheba
and
called
there
on
the
name
of
the
lord
the
everlasting
god
21
34
and
abraham
sojourned
in
the
philistines’
land
many
days
22
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
god
did
tempt
abraham
and
said
unto
him
abraham
and
he
said
behold
here
i
am
22
2
and
he
said
take
now
thy
son
thine
only
son
isaac
whom
thou
lovest
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
moriah
and
offer
him
there
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
one
of
the
mountains
which
i
will
tell
thee
of
22
3
and
abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
ass
and
took
two
of
his
young
men
with
him
and
isaac
his
son
and
clave
the
wood
for
the
burnt
offering
and
rose
up
and
went
unto
the
place
of
which
god
had
told
him
22
4
then
on
the
third
day
abraham
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
place
afar
off
22
5
and
abraham
said
unto
his
young
men
abide
ye
here
with
the
ass
and
i
and
the
lad
will
go
yonder
and
worship
and
come
again
to
you
22
6
and
abraham
took
the
wood
of
the
burnt
offering
and
laid
it
upon
isaac
his
son
and
he
took
the
fire
in
his
hand
and
a
knife
and
they
went
both
of
them
together
22
7
and
isaac
spake
unto
abraham
his
father
and
said
my
father
and
he
said
here
am
i
my
son
and
he
said
behold
the
fire
and
the
wood
but
where
is
the
lamb
for
a
burnt
offering
22
8
and
abraham
said
my
son
god
will
provide
himself
a
lamb
for
a
burnt
offering
so
they
went
both
of
them
together
22
9
and
they
came
to
the
place
which
god
had
told
him
of
and
abraham
built
an
altar
there
and
laid
the
wood
in
order
and
bound
isaac
his
son
and
laid
him
on
the
altar
upon
the
wood
22
10
and
abraham
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
took
the
knife
to
slay
his
son
22
11
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
called
unto
him
out
of
heaven
and
said
abraham
abraham
and
he
said
here
am
i
22
12
and
he
said
lay
not
thine
hand
upon
the
lad
neither
do
thou
any
thing
unto
him
for
now
i
know
that
thou
fearest
god
seeing
thou
hast
not
withheld
thy
son
thine
only
son
from
me
22
13
and
abraham
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
behind
him
a
ram
caught
in
a
thicket
by
his
horns
and
abraham
went
and
took
the
ram
and
offered
him
up
for
a
burnt
offering
in
the
stead
of
his
son
22
14
and
abraham
called
the
name
of
that
place
jehovahjireh
as
it
is
said
to
this
day
in
the
mount
of
the
lord
it
shall
be
seen
22
15
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
called
unto
abraham
out
of
heaven
the
second
time
22
16
and
said
by
myself
have
i
sworn
saith
the
lord
for
because
thou
hast
done
this
thing
and
hast
not
withheld
thy
son
thine
only
son
22
17
that
in
blessing
i
will
bless
thee
and
in
multiplying
i
will
multiply
thy
seed
as
the
stars
of
the
heaven
and
as
the
sand
which
is
upon
the
sea
shore
and
thy
seed
shall
possess
the
gate
of
his
enemies
22
18
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
because
thou
hast
obeyed
my
voice
22
19
so
abraham
returned
unto
his
young
men
and
they
rose
up
and
went
together
to
beersheba
and
abraham
dwelt
at
beersheba
22
20
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
it
was
told
abraham
saying
behold
milcah
she
hath
also
born
children
unto
thy
brother
nahor
22
21
huz
his
firstborn
and
buz

brother
and
kemuel
the
father
of
aram
22
22
and
chesed
and
hazo
and
pildash
and
jidlaph
and
bethuel
22
23
and
bethuel
begat
rebekah
these
eight
milcah
did
bear
to
nahor
abraham’s
brother
22
24

the

then
thou

and
he
arose
and
went
to
mesopotamia
unto
the
city
of

24
11
and
he
made
his
camels
to
kneel
down
without
the
city
by
a
well
of
water
at
the
time
of
the
evening
even
the
time
that
women
go
out
to
draw
water
24
12
and
he
said
o

god
of
my
master
abraham
i
pray
thee

speed
this
day
and
shew
kindness
unto

she
that

for
thy
servant
isaac
and
thereby
shall
i
know
that
thou
hast
shewed
kindness
unto
my
master
24
15
and
it
came
to
pass
before
he
had
done
speaking
that
behold
rebekah
came
out
who
was
born
to
bethuel
son
of
milcah
the
wife
of
nahor
abraham’s
brother
with
her
pitcher
upon
her
shoulder
24
16
and
the
damsel
was
very
fair
to
look
upon
a
virgin
neither
had
any
man
known
her
and
she
went
down
to
the
well
and
filled
her
pitcher
and
came
up
24
17
and
the
servant
ran
to
meet
her
and
said
let
me
i
pray
thee
drink
a
little
water
of
thy
pitcher
24
18
and
she
said
drink
my
lord
and
she
hasted
and
let
down
her
pitcher
upon
her
hand
and
gave
him
drink
24
19
and
when
she
had
done
giving
him
drink
she
said
i
will
draw
water
for
thy
camels
also
until
they
have
done
drinking
24
20
and
she
hasted
and
emptied
her
pitcher
into
the
trough
and
ran
again
unto
the
well
to
draw
water
and
drew
for
all
his
camels
24
21
and
the
man
wondering
at
her
held
his
peace
to
wit
whether
the
lord
had
made
his
journey
prosperous
or
not
24
22
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
camels
had
done
drinking
that
the
man
took
a
golden
earring
of
half
a
shekel
weight
and
two
bracelets
for
her
hands
of
ten
shekels
weight
of
gold

tell
me
i
pray
thee
is

room
in
thy
father’s
house
for

24
and
she
said
unto
him

the
daughter
of
bethuel
the
son
of

which
she
bare
unto

24
25
she
said
moreover
unto
him

24
26
and
the
man
bowed
down
his
head
and
worshipped
the
lord
24
27
and
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
my
master
abraham
who
hath
not
left
destitute
my
master
of
his
mercy
and
his
truth
i
being
in
the
way
the
lord
led
me
to
the
house
of
my
master’s
brethren
24
28
and
the
damsel
ran
and
told
them
of
her
mother’s
house
these
things
24
29
and
rebekah
had
a
brother
and
his
name
was
laban
and
laban
ran
out
unto
the
man
unto
the
well
24
30
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
saw
the
earring
and
bracelets
upon
his
sister’s
hands
and
when
he
heard
the
words
of
rebekah
his
sister
saying
thus
spake
the
man
unto
me
that
he
came
unto
the
man
and
behold
he
stood
by
the
camels
at
the
well
24
31
and
he
said
come
in
thou
blessed
of
the
lord
wherefore
standest
thou
without
for
i
have
prepared
the
house
and
room
for
the
camels
24
32
and
the
man
came
into
the
house
and
he
ungirded
his
camels
and
gave
straw
and
provender
for
the
camels
and
water
to
wash
his
feet
and
the
men’s
feet
that
were
with
him
24
33
and
there
was
set
meat
before
him
to
eat
but
he
said
i
will
not
eat
until
i
have
told
mine
errand
and
he
said
speak
on
24
34
and
he
said
i
am
abraham’s
servant
24
35
and
the
lord
hath
blessed
my
master
greatly
and
he
is
become
great
and
he
hath
given
him
flocks
and
herds
and
silver
and

and
maidservants
and

a
son
to
my
master
when
she
was
old
and
unto
him
hath
he
given
all
that
he
hath
24
37
and
my
master
made
me
swear
saying
thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
to
my
son
of
the
daughters
of
the
canaanites
in
whose
land
i
dwell
24
38
but
thou
shalt
go
unto
my
father’s
house
and
to
my
kindred
and
take
a
wife
unto
my
son
24
39
and
i
said
unto
my
master
peradventure
the
woman
will
not
follow
me
24
40
and
he
said
unto
me
the
lord
before
whom
i
walk
will
send
his
angel
with
thee
and
prosper
thy
way
and
thou
shalt
take
a
wife
for
my
son
of
my
kindred
and
of
my
father’s
house
24
41
then
shalt
thou
be
clear
from
this
my
oath
when
thou
comest
to
my
kindred
and
if
they
give
not
thee
one
thou
shalt
be
clear
from
my
oath
24
42
and
i
came
this
day
unto
the
well
and
said
o
lord
god
of
my
master
abraham
if
now
thou
do
prosper
my
way
which
i
go
24
43
behold
i
stand
by
the
well
of
water
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
virgin
cometh
forth
to
draw
water
and
i
say
to
her
give
me
i
pray

24
44
and
she

thy
camels
let
the
same
be
the
woman
whom
the
lord
hath
appointed
out
for
my
master’s
son
24
45
and
before
i
had
done
speaking
in
mine
heart
behold
rebekah
came
forth
with
her
pitcher
on
her
shoulder
and
she
went
down
unto
the
well
and
drew
water
and
i
said
unto
her
let
me
drink
i
pray
thee
24
46
and
she
made
haste
and
let
down
her
pitcher
from
her
shoulder
and
said
drink
and
i
will
give
thy
camels
drink
also
so
i
drank
and
she
made
the
camels
drink
also
24
47
and
i
asked
her
and
said
whose
daughter
art
thou
and
she
said
the
daughter
of
bethuel
nahor’s
son
whom
milcah
bare
unto
him
and
i
put
the
earring
upon
her
face
and
the
bracelets
upon
her
hands
24
48
and
i
bowed
down
my
head
and
worshipped
the
lord
and
blessed
the
lord
god
of
my
master
abraham
which
had
led
me
in
the
right
way
to
take
my
master’s
brother’s
daughter
unto
his
son
24
49
and
now
if
ye
will
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
my
master
tell
me
and
if
not
tell
me
that
i
may
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
24
50
then
laban
and
bethuel
answered
and
said
the
thing
proceedeth
from
the
lord
we
cannot
speak
unto
thee
bad
or
good
24
51
behold
rebekah
is
before
thee
take
her
and
go
and
let
her
be
thy
master’s
son’s
wife
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
24
52
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
abraham’s
servant
heard
their
words
he
worshipped
the
lord
bowing
himself
to
the
earth
24
53
and
the
servant
brought
forth
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold
and
raiment
and
gave
them
to
rebekah
he
gave
also
to
her
brother
and
to
her
mother
precious
things
24
54
and
they
did
eat
and
drink
he
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
and
tarried
all
night
and
they
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
he
said
send
me
away
unto
my
master
24
55
and
her
brother
and
her
mother
said
let
the
damsel
abide
with
us
a
few
days
at
the
least
ten
after
that
she
shall
go
24
56
and
he
said
unto
them
hinder
me
not
seeing
the
lord
hath
prospered
my
way
send
me
away
that
i
may
go
to
my
master
24
57
and
they
said
we
will
call
the
damsel
and
enquire
at
her
mouth
24
58
and
they
called
rebekah
and
said
unto
her
wilt
thou
go
with
this
man
and
she
said
i
will
go
24
59
and
they
sent
away
rebekah
their
sister
and
her
nurse
and
abraham’s
servant
and
his
men
24
60
and
they
blessed
rebekah
and
said
unto
her
thou
art
our
sister
be
thou
the
mother
of
thousands
of
millions
and
let
thy
seed
possess
the
gate
of
those
which
hate
them
24
61
and
rebekah
arose
and
her
damsels
and
they
rode
upon
the
camels
and
followed
the
man
and
the
servant
took
rebekah
and
went
his
way
24
62
and
isaac
came
from
the
way
of
the
well
lahairoi
for
he
dwelt
in
the
south
country
24
63
and
isaac
went
out
to
meditate
in
the
field
at
the
eventide
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
and
behold
the
camels
were
coming
24
64
and
rebekah
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
isaac
she
lighted
off
the
camel
24
65
for
she
had
said
unto
the
servant
what
man
is
this
that
walketh
in
the
field
to
meet
us
and
the
servant
had
said
it
is
my
master
therefore
she
took
a
vail
and
covered
herself
24
66
and
the
servant
told
isaac
all
things
that
he
had
done
24
67
and
isaac
brought
her
into
his
mother
sarah’s
tent
and
took
rebekah
and
she
became
his
wife
and
he
loved
her
and
isaac
was
comforted
after
his
mother’s
death
25

then
again
abraham
took
a
wife
and
her
name
was
keturah
25

and
she
bare
him
zimran
and
jokshan
and

and
midian
and
ishbak
and

and

begat
sheba
and
dedan
and
the
sons
of

were
asshurim
and
letushim
and

and
the
sons
of
midian
ephah
and
epher
and
hanoch
and
abidah
and
eldaah
all
these
were
the
children
of
keturah
25
5
and
abraham
gave
all
that
he
had
unto
isaac
25
6
but
unto
the
sons
of
the
concubines
which
abraham
had
abraham
gave
gifts
and
sent
them
away
from
isaac
his
son
while
he
yet
lived
eastward
unto
the
east
country
25
7
and
these
are
the
days
of
the
years
of
abraham’s
life
which
he
lived
an
hundred
threescore
and
fifteen
years
25
8
then
abraham
gave
up
the
ghost
and
died
in
a
good
old
age
an
old
man
and
full
of
years
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
25
9
and
his
sons
isaac
and
ishmael
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
machpelah
in
the
field
of
ephron
the
son
of
zohar
the
hittite
which
is
before
mamre
25
10
the
field
which
abraham
purchased
of
the
sons
of
heth
there
was
abraham
buried
and
sarah
his
wife
25
11
and
it
came
to
pass
after
the
death
of
abraham
that
god
blessed
his
son
isaac
and
isaac
dwelt
by
the
well
lahairoi
25
12
now
these
are
the
generations
of
ishmael
abraham’s
son
whom
hagar
the
egyptian
sarah’s
handmaid
bare
unto
abraham
25
13
and
these
are
the
names
of
the
sons
of
ishmael
by
their
names
according
to
their
generations
the
firstborn
of
ishmael
nebajoth
and
kedar
and
adbeel
and
mibsam
25
14
and
mishma
and
dumah
and
massa
25
15
hadar
and
tema
jetur
naphish
and
kedemah
25
16
these
are
the
sons
of
ishmael
and
these
are
their
names
by
their
towns
and
by
their
castles
twelve
princes
according
to
their
nations
25
17
and
these
are
the
years
of
the
life
of
ishmael
an
hundred
and
thirty
and
seven
years
and
he
gave
up
the
ghost
and
died
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people
25
18
and
they
dwelt
from
havilah
unto
shur
that
is
before
egypt
as
thou
goest
toward
assyria
and
he
died
in
the
presence
of
all
his
brethren
25
19
and
these
are
the
generations
of
isaac
abraham’s
son
abraham
begat
isaac
25
20
and
isaac
was
forty
years
old
when
he
took
rebekah
to
wife
the
daughter
of
bethuel
the
syrian
of
padanaram
the
sister
to
laban
the
syrian
25
21
and
isaac
intreated
the
lord
for
his
wife
because
she
was
barren
and
the
lord
was
intreated
of
him
and
rebekah
his
wife
conceived
25
22
and
the
children
struggled
together
within
her
and
she
said
if
it
be
so
why
am
i
thus
and
she
went
to
enquire
of
the
lord
25
23
and
the
lord
said
unto
her
two
nations
are
in
thy
womb
and
two
manner
of
people
shall
be
separated
from
thy
bowels
and
the
one
people
shall
be
stronger
than
the
other
people
and
the
elder
shall
serve
the
younger
25
24
and
when
her
days
to
be
delivered
were
fulfilled
behold
there
were
twins
in
her
womb
25
25
and
the
first
came
out
red
all
over
like
an
hairy
garment
and
they
called
his
name
esau
25
26
and
after
that
came
his
brother
out
and
his
hand
took
hold
on
esau’s
heel
and
his
name
was
called
jacob
and
isaac
was
threescore
years
old
when
she
bare
them
25
27
and
the
boys
grew
and
esau
was
a
cunning
hunter
a
man
of
the
field
and
jacob
was
a
plain
man
dwelling
in
tents
25
28
and
isaac
loved
esau
because
he
did
eat
of
his
venison
but
rebekah
loved
jacob
25
29
and
jacob
sod
pottage
and
esau
came
from
the
field
and
he
was
faint
25
30
and
esau
said
to
jacob
feed
me
i
pray
thee
with
that
same
red
pottage
for
i
am
faint
therefore
was
his
name
called
edom
25
31
and
jacob
said
sell
me
this
day
thy
birthright
25
32
and
esau
said
behold
i
am
at
the
point
to
die
and
what
profit
shall
this
birthright
do
to
me
25
33
and
jacob
said
swear
to
me
this
day
and
he
sware
unto
him
and
he
sold
his
birthright
unto
jacob
25
34
then
jacob
gave
esau
bread
and
pottage
of
lentiles
and
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
rose
up
and
went
his
way
thus
esau
despised
his
birthright
26
1
and
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land
beside
the
first
famine
that
was
in
the
days
of
abraham
and
isaac
went
unto
abimelech
king
of
the
philistines
unto
gerar
26
2
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
and
said
go
not
down
into
egypt
dwell
in
the
land
which
i
shall
tell
thee
of
26
3
sojourn
in
this
land
and
i
will
be
with
thee
and
will
bless
thee
for
unto
thee
and
unto
thy
seed
i
will
give
all
these
countries
and
i
will
perform
the
oath
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
thy
father
26
4
and
i
will
make
thy
seed
to
multiply
as
the
stars
of
heaven
and
will
give
unto
thy
seed
all
these
countries
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
26
5
because
that
abraham
obeyed
my
voice
and
kept
my
charge
my
commandments
my
statutes
and
my
laws
26
6
and
isaac
dwelt
in
gerar
26
7
and
the
men
of
the
place
asked
him
of
his
wife
and
he
said
she
is
my
sister
for
he
feared
to
say
she
is
my
wife
lest
said
he
the
men
of
the
place
should
kill
me
for
rebekah
because
she
was
fair
to
look
upon
26
8
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
had
been
there
a
long
time
that
abimelech
king
of
the
philistines
looked
out
at
a
window
and
saw
and
behold
isaac
was
sporting
with
rebekah
his
wife
26
9
and
abimelech
called
isaac
and
said
behold
of
a
surety
she
is
thy
wife
and
how
saidst
thou
she
is
my
sister
and
isaac
said
unto
him
because
i
said
lest
i
die
for
her
26
10
and
abimelech
said
what
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
us
one
of
the
people
might
lightly
have
lien
with
thy
wife
and
thou
shouldest
have
brought
guiltiness
upon
us
26
11
and
abimelech
charged
all
his
people
saying
he
that
toucheth
this
man
or
his
wife
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
26
12
then
isaac
sowed
in
that
land
and
received
in
the
same
year
an
hundredfold
and
the
lord
blessed
him
26
13
and
the
man
waxed
great
and
went
forward
and
grew
until
he
became
very
great
26
14
for
he
had
possession
of
flocks
and
possession
of
herds
and
great
store
of
servants
and
the
philistines
envied
him
26
15
for
all
the
wells
which
his
father’s
servants
had
digged
in
the
days
of
abraham
his
father
the
philistines
had
stopped
them
and
filled
them
with
earth
26
16
and
abimelech
said
unto
isaac
go
from
us
for
thou
art
much
mightier
than
we
26
17
and
isaac
departed
thence
and
pitched
his
tent
in
the
valley
of
gerar
and
dwelt
there
26
18
and
isaac
digged
again
the
wells
of
water
which
they
had
digged
in
the
days
of
abraham
his
father
for
the
philistines
had
stopped
them
after
the
death
of
abraham
and
he
called
their
names
after
the
names
by
which
his
father
had
called
them
26
19
and
isaac’s
servants
digged
in
the
valley
and
found
there
a
well
of
springing
water
26
20
and
the
herdmen
of
gerar
did
strive
with
isaac’s
herdmen
saying
the
water
is
ours
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
well
esek
because
they
strove
with
him
26
21
and
they
digged
another
well
and
strove
for
that
also
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
sitnah
26
22
and
he
removed
from
thence
and
digged
another
well
and
for
that
they
strove
not
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
rehoboth
and
he
said
for
now
the
lord
hath
made
room
for
us
and
we
shall
be
fruitful
in
the
land
26
23
and
he
went
up
from
thence
to
beersheba
26
24
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
the
same
night
and
said
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
thy
father
fear
not
for
i
am
with
thee
and
will
bless
thee
and
multiply
thy
seed
for
my
servant
abraham’s
sake
26
25
and
he
builded
an
altar
there
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
and
pitched
his
tent
there
and
there
isaac’s
servants
digged
a
well
26
26
then
abimelech
went
to
him
from
gerar
and
ahuzzath
one
of
his
friends
and
phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
army
26
27
and
isaac
said
unto
them
wherefore
come
ye
to
me
seeing
ye
hate
me
and
have
sent
me
away
from
you
26
28
and
they
said
we
saw
certainly
that
the
lord
was
with
thee
and
we
said
let
there
be
now
an
oath
betwixt
us
even
betwixt
us
and
thee
and
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
thee
26
29
that
thou
wilt
do
us
no
hurt
as
we
have
not
touched
thee
and
as
we
have
done
unto
thee
nothing
but
good
and
have
sent
thee
away
in
peace
thou
art
now
the
blessed
of
the
lord
26
30
and
he
made
them
a
feast
and
they
did
eat
and
drink
26
31
and
they
rose
up
betimes
in
the
morning
and
sware
one
to
another
and
isaac
sent
them
away
and
they
departed
from
him
in
peace
26
32
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
day
that
isaac’s
servants
came
and
told
him
concerning
the
well
which
they
had
digged
and
said
unto
him
we
have
found
water
26
33
and
he
called
it
shebah
therefore
the
name
of
the
city
is
beersheba
unto
this
day
26
34
and
esau
was
forty
years
old
when
he
took
to
wife
judith
the
daughter
of
beeri
the
hittite
and
bashemath
the
daughter
of
elon
the
hittite
26
35
which
were
a
grief
of
mind
unto
isaac
and
to
rebekah
27
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
isaac
was
old
and
his
eyes
were
dim
so
that
he
could
not
see
he
called
esau
his
eldest
son
and
said
unto
him
my
son
and
he
said
unto
him
behold
here
am
i
27
2
and
he
said
behold
now
i
am
old
i
know
not
the
day
of
my
death
27
3
now
therefore
take
i
pray
thee
thy
weapons
thy
quiver
and
thy
bow
and
go
out
to
the
field
and
take
me
some
venison
27
4
and
make
me
savoury
meat
such
as
i
love
and
bring
it
to
me
that
i
may
eat
that
my
soul
may
bless
thee
before
i
die
27
5
and
rebekah
heard
when
isaac
spake
to
esau
his
son
and
esau
went
to
the
field
to
hunt
for
venison
and
to
bring
it
27
6
and
rebekah
spake
unto
jacob
her
son
saying
behold
i
heard
thy
father
speak
unto
esau
thy
brother
saying
27
7
bring
me
venison
and
make
me
savoury
meat
that
i
may
eat
and
bless
thee
before
the
lord
before
my
death
27
8
now
therefore
my
son
obey
my
voice
according
to
that
which
i
command
thee
27
9
go
now
to
the
flock
and
fetch
me
from
thence
two
good
kids
of
the
goats
and
i
will
make
them
savoury
meat
for
thy
father
such
as
he
loveth
27
10
and
thou
shalt
bring
it
to
thy
father
that
he
may
eat
and
that
he
may
bless
thee
before
his
death
27
11
and
jacob
said
to
rebekah
his
mother
behold
esau
my
brother
is
a
hairy
man
and
i
am
a
smooth
man
27
12
my
father
peradventure
will
feel
me
and
i
shall
seem
to
him
as
a
deceiver
and
i
shall
bring
a
curse
upon
me
and
not
a
blessing
27
13
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
upon
me
be
thy
curse
my
son
only
obey
my
voice
and
go
fetch
me
them
27
14
and
he
went
and
fetched
and
brought
them
to
his
mother
and
his
mother
made
savoury
meat
such
as
his
father
loved
27
15
and
rebekah
took
goodly
raiment
of
her
eldest
son
esau
which
were
with
her
in
the
house
and
put
them
upon
jacob
her
younger
son
27
16
and
she
put
the
skins
of
the
kids
of
the
goats
upon
his
hands
and
upon
the
smooth
of
his
neck
27
17
and
she
gave
the
savoury
meat
and
the
bread
which
she
had
prepared
into
the
hand
of
her
son
jacob
27
18
and
he
came
unto
his
father
and
said
my
father
and
he
said
here
am
i
who
art
thou
my
son
27
19
and
jacob
said
unto
his
father
i
am
esau
thy
first
born
i
have
done
according
as
thou
badest
me
arise
i
pray
thee
sit
and
eat
of
my
venison
that
thy
soul
may
bless
me
27
20
and
isaac
said
unto
his
son
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
found
it
so
quickly
my
son
and
he
said
because
the
lord
thy
god
brought
it
to
me
27
21
and
isaac
said
unto
jacob
come
near
i
pray
thee
that
i
may
feel
thee
my
son
whether
thou
be
my
very
son
esau
or
not
27
22
and
jacob
went
near
unto
isaac
his
father
and
he
felt
him
and
said
the
voice
is
jacob’s
voice
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
esau
27
23
and
he
discerned
him
not
because
his
hands
were
hairy
as
his
brother
esau’s
hands
so
he
blessed
him
27
24
and
he
said
art
thou
my
very
son
esau
and
he
said
i
am
27
25
and
he
said
bring
it
near
to
me
and
i
will
eat
of
my
son’s
venison
that
my
soul
may
bless
thee
and
he
brought
it
near
to
him
and
he
did
eat
and
he
brought
him
wine
and
he
drank
27
26
and
his
father
isaac
said
unto
him
come
near
now
and
kiss
me
my
son
27
27
and
he
came
near
and
kissed
him
and
he
smelled
the
smell
of
his
raiment
and
blessed
him
and
said
see
the
smell
of
my
son
is
as
the
smell
of
a
field
which
the
lord
hath
blessed
27
28
therefore
god
give
thee
of
the
dew
of
heaven
and
the
fatness
of
the
earth
and
plenty
of
corn
and
wine
27
29
let
people
serve
thee
and
nations
bow
down
to
thee
be
lord
over
thy
brethren
and
let
thy
mother’s
sons
bow
down
to
thee
cursed
be
every
one
that
curseth
thee
and
blessed
be
he
that
blesseth
thee
27
30
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
isaac
had
made
an
end
of
blessing
jacob
and
jacob
was
yet
scarce
gone
out
from
the
presence
of
isaac
his
father
that
esau
his
brother
came
in
from
his
hunting
27
31
and
he
also
had
made
savoury
meat
and
brought
it
unto
his
father
and
said
unto
his
father
let
my
father
arise
and
eat
of
his
son’s
venison
that
thy
soul
may
bless
me
27
32
and
isaac
his
father
said
unto
him
who
art
thou
and
he
said
i
am
thy
son
thy
firstborn
esau
27
33
and
isaac
trembled
very
exceedingly
and
said
who
where
is
he
that
hath
taken
venison
and
brought
it
me
and
i
have
eaten
of
all
before
thou
camest
and
have
blessed
him
yea
and
he
shall
be
blessed
27
34
and
when
esau
heard
the
words
of
his
father
he
cried
with
a
great
and
exceeding
bitter
cry
and
said
unto
his
father
bless
me
even
me
also
o
my
father
27
35
and
he
said
thy
brother
came
with
subtilty
and
hath
taken
away
thy
blessing
27
36
and
he
said
is
not
he
rightly
named
jacob
for
he
hath
supplanted
me
these
two
times
he
took
away
my
birthright
and
behold
now
he
hath
taken
away
my
blessing
and
he
said
hast
thou
not
reserved
a
blessing
for
me
27
37
and
isaac
answered
and
said
unto
esau
behold
i
have
made
him
thy
lord
and
all
his
brethren
have
i
given
to
him
for
servants
and
with
corn
and
wine
have
i
sustained
him
and
what
shall
i
do
now
unto
thee
my
son
27
38
and
esau
said
unto
his
father
hast
thou
but
one
blessing
my
father
bless
me
even
me
also
o
my
father
and
esau
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
27
39
and
isaac
his
father
answered
and
said
unto
him
behold
thy
dwelling
shall
be
the
fatness
of
the
earth
and
of
the
dew
of
heaven
from
above
27
40
and
by
thy
sword
shalt
thou
live
and
shalt
serve
thy
brother
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
shalt
have
the
dominion
that
thou
shalt
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
27
41
and
esau
hated
jacob
because
of
the
blessing
wherewith
his
father
blessed
him
and
esau
said
in
his
heart
the
days
of
mourning
for
my
father
are
at
hand
then
will
i
slay
my
brother
jacob
27
42
and
these
words
of
esau
her
elder
son
were
told
to
rebekah
and
she
sent
and
called
jacob
her
younger
son
and
said
unto
him
behold
thy
brother
esau
as
touching
thee
doth
comfort
himself
purposing
to
kill
thee
27
43
now
therefore
my
son
obey
my
voice
arise
flee
thou
to
laban
my
brother
to
haran
27
44
and
tarry
with
him
a
few
days
until
thy
brother’s
fury
turn
away
27
45
until
thy
brother’s
anger
turn
away
from
thee
and
he
forget
that
which
thou
hast
done
to
him
then
i
will
send
and
fetch
thee
from
thence
why
should
i
be
deprived
also
of
you
both
in
one
day
27
46
and
rebekah
said
to
isaac
i
am
weary
of
my
life
because
of
the
daughters
of
heth
if
jacob
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
heth
such
as
these
which
are
of
the
daughters
of
the
land
what
good
shall
my
life
do
me
28
1
and
isaac
called
jacob
and
blessed
him
and
charged
him
and
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
canaan
28
2
arise
go
to
padanaram
to
the
house
of
bethuel
thy
mother’s
father
and
take
thee
a
wife
from
thence
of
the
daughters
of
laban
thy
mother’s
brother
28
3
and
god
almighty
bless
thee
and
make
thee
fruitful
and
multiply
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
a
multitude
of
people
28
4
and
give
thee
the
blessing
of
abraham
to
thee
and
to
thy
seed
with
thee
that
thou
mayest
inherit
the
land
wherein
thou
art
a
stranger
which
god
gave
unto
abraham
28
5
and
isaac
sent
away
jacob
and
he
went
to
padanaram
unto
laban
son
of
bethuel
the
syrian
the
brother
of
rebekah
jacob’s
and
esau’s
mother
28
6
when
esau
saw
that
isaac
had
blessed
jacob
and
sent
him
away
to
padanaram
to
take
him
a
wife
from
thence
and
that
as
he
blessed
him
he
gave
him
a
charge
saying
thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
canaan
28
7
and
that
jacob
obeyed
his
father
and
his
mother
and
was
gone
to
padanaram
28
8
and
esau
seeing
that
the
daughters
of
canaan
pleased
not
isaac
his
father
28
9
then
went
esau
unto
ishmael
and
took
unto
the
wives
which
he
had
mahalath
the
daughter
of
ishmael
abraham’s
son
the
sister
of
nebajoth
to
be
his
wife
28
10
and
jacob
went
out
from
beersheba
and
went
toward
haran
28
11
and
he
lighted
upon
a
certain
place
and
tarried
there
all
night
because
the
sun
was
set
and
he
took
of
the
stones
of
that
place
and
put
them
for
his
pillows
and
lay
down
in
that
place
to
sleep
28
12
and
he
dreamed
and
behold
a
ladder
set
up
on
the
earth
and
the
top
of
it
reached
to
heaven
and
behold
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
on
it
28
13
and
behold
the
lord
stood
above
it
and
said
i
am
the
lord
god
of
abraham
thy
father
and
the
god
of
isaac
the
land
whereon
thou
liest
to
thee
will
i
give
it
and
to
thy
seed
28
14
and
thy
seed
shall
be
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
thou
shalt
spread
abroad
to
the
west
and
to
the
east
and
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
and
in
thee
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
families
of
the
earth
be
blessed
28
15
and
behold
i
am
with
thee
and
will
keep
thee
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest
and
will
bring
thee
again
into
this
land
for
i
will
not
leave
thee
until
i
have
done
that
which
i
have
spoken
to
thee
of
28
16
and
jacob
awaked
out
of
his
sleep
and
he
said
surely
the
lord
is
in
this
place
and
i
knew
it
not
28
17
and
he
was
afraid
and
said
how
dreadful
is
this
place
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
god
and
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven
28
18
and
jacob
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
took
the
stone
that
he
had
put
for
his
pillows
and
set
it
up
for
a
pillar
and
poured
oil
upon
the
top
of
it
28
19
and
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
bethel
but
the
name
of
that
city
was
called
luz
at
the
first
28
20
and
jacob
vowed
a
vow
saying
if
god
will
be
with
me
and
will
keep
me
in
this
way
that
i
go
and
will
give
me
bread
to
eat
and
raiment
to
put
on
28
21
so
that
i
come
again
to
my
father’s
house
in
peace
then
shall
the
lord
be
my
god
28
22
and
this
stone
which
i
have
set
for
a
pillar
shall
be
god’s
house
and
of
all
that
thou
shalt
give
me
i
will
surely
give
the
tenth
unto
thee
29
1
then
jacob
went
on
his
journey
and
came
into
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
east
29
2
and
he
looked
and
behold
a
well
in
the
field
and
lo
there
were
three
flocks
of
sheep
lying
by
it
for
out
of
that
well
they
watered
the
flocks
and
a
great
stone
was
upon
the
well’s
mouth
29
3
and
thither
were
all
the
flocks
gathered
and
they
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well’s
mouth
and
watered
the
sheep
and
put
the
stone
again
upon
the
well’s
mouth
in
his
place
29
4
and
jacob
said
unto
them
my
brethren
whence
be
ye
and
they
said
of
haran
are
we
29
5
and
he
said
unto
them
know
ye
laban
the
son
of
nahor
and
they
said
we
know
him
29
6
and
he
said
unto
them
is
he
well
and
they
said
he
is
well
and
behold
rachel
his
daughter
cometh
with
the
sheep
29
7
and
he
said
lo
it
is
yet
high
day
neither
is
it
time
that
the
cattle
should
be
gathered
together
water
ye
the
sheep
and
go
and
feed
them
29
8
and
they
said
we
cannot
until
all
the
flocks
be
gathered
together
and
till
they
roll
the
stone
from
the
well’s
mouth
then
we
water
the
sheep
29
9
and
while
he
yet
spake
with
them
rachel
came
with
her
father’s
sheep
for
she
kept
them
29
10
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jacob
saw
rachel
the
daughter
of
laban
his
mother’s
brother
and
the
sheep
of
laban
his
mother’s
brother
that
jacob
went
near
and
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well’s
mouth
and
watered
the
flock
of
laban
his
mother’s
brother
29
11
and
jacob
kissed
rachel
and
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
29
12
and
jacob
told
rachel
that
he
was
her
father’s
brother
and
that
he
was
rebekah’s
son
and
she
ran
and
told
her
father
29
13
and
it
came
to
pass
when
laban
heard
the
tidings
of
jacob
his
sister’s
son
that
he
ran
to
meet
him
and
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
and
brought
him
to
his
house
and
he
told
laban
all
these
things
29
14
and
laban
said
to
him
surely
thou
art
my
bone
and
my
flesh
and
he
abode
with
him
the
space
of
a
month
29
15
and
laban
said
unto
jacob
because
thou
art
my
brother
shouldest
thou
therefore
serve
me
for
nought
tell
me
what
shall
thy
wages
be
29
16
and
laban
had
two
daughters
the
name
of
the
elder
was
leah
and
the
name
of
the
younger
was
rachel
29
17
leah
was
tender
eyed
but
rachel
was
beautiful
and
well
favoured
29
18
and
jacob
loved
rachel
and
said
i
will
serve
thee
seven
years
for
rachel
thy
younger
daughter
29
19
and
laban
said
it
is
better
that
i
give
her
to
thee
than
that
i
should
give
her
to
another
man
abide
with
me
29
20
and
jacob
served
seven
years
for
rachel
and
they
seemed
unto
him
but
a
few
days
for
the
love
he
had
to
her
29
21
and
jacob
said
unto
laban
give
me
my
wife
for
my
days
are
fulfilled
that
i
may
go
in
unto
her
29
22
and
laban
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
the
place
and
made
a
feast
29
23
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
evening
that
he
took
leah
his
daughter
and
brought
her
to
him
and
he
went
in
unto
her
29
24
and
laban
gave
unto
his
daughter
leah
zilpah
his
maid
for
an
handmaid
29
25
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
morning
behold
it
was
leah
and
he
said
to
laban
what
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
me
did
not
i
serve
with
thee
for
rachel
wherefore
then
hast
thou
beguiled
me
29
26
and
laban
said
it
must
not
be
so
done
in
our
country
to
give
the
younger
before
the
firstborn
29
27
fulfil
her
week
and
we
will
give
thee
this
also
for
the
service
which
thou
shalt
serve
with
me
yet
seven
other
years
29
28
and
jacob
did
so
and
fulfilled
her
week
and
he
gave
him
rachel
his
daughter
to
wife
also
29
29
and
laban
gave
to
rachel
his
daughter
bilhah
his
handmaid
to
be
her
maid
29
30
and
he
went
in
also
unto
rachel
and
he
loved
also
rachel
more
than
leah
and
served
with
him
yet
seven
other
years
29
31
and
when
the
lord
saw
that
leah
was
hated
he
opened
her
womb
but
rachel
was
barren
29
32
and
leah
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
she
called
his
name
reuben
for
she
said
surely
the
lord
hath
looked
upon
my
affliction
now
therefore
my
husband
will
love
me
29
33
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
son
and
said
because
the
lord
hath
heard
i
was
hated
he
hath
therefore
given
me
this
son
also
and
she
called
his
name
simeon
29
34
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
son
and
said
now
this
time
will
my
husband
be
joined
unto
me
because
i
have
born
him
three
sons
therefore
was
his
name
called
levi
29
35
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
son
and
she
said
now

i
praise
the
lord
therefore
she
called
his
name
judah
and
left
bearing
30
1
and
when
rachel
saw
that
she
bare
jacob
no
children
rachel
envied
her
sister
and
said
unto
jacob
give
me
children
or
else
i
die
30
2
and
jacob’s
anger
was
kindled
against
rachel
and
he
said
am
i
in
god’s
stead
who
hath
withheld
from
thee
the
fruit
of
the
womb
30
3
and
she
said
behold
my
maid
bilhah
go
in
unto
her
and
she
shall
bear
upon
my
knees
that
i
may
also
have
children
by
her
30
4
and
she
gave
him
bilhah
her
handmaid
to
wife
and
jacob
went
in
unto
her
30
5
and
bilhah
conceived
and
bare
jacob
a
son
30
6
and
rachel
said
god
hath
judged
me
and
hath
also
heard
my
voice
and
hath
given
me
a
son
therefore
called
she
his
name
dan
30
7
and
bilhah
rachel’s
maid
conceived
again
and
bare
jacob
a
second
son
30
8
and
rachel
said
with
great
wrestlings
have
i
wrestled
with
my
sister
and
i
have
prevailed
and
she
called
his
name

30
9
when
leah
saw
that
she
had
left
bearing
she
took
zilpah
her

and
gave
her
jacob
to

30
10
and
zilpah
leah’s
maid
bare

30
11
and
leah

30
12
and
zilpah
leah’s
maid
bare
jacob
a

30
13
and
leah
said
happy

i
for

and
she
called

30
14
and
reuben
went
in
the
days
of
wheat
harvest
and
found
mandrakes
in
the
field
and
brought
them
unto
his
mother
leah
then
rachel
said
to
leah
give
me
i
pray
thee
of
thy
son’s
mandrakes
30
15
and
she
said
unto
her
is
it
a
small
matter
that
thou
hast
taken
my
husband
and
wouldest
thou
take
away
my
son’s
mandrakes
also
and
rachel
said
therefore
he
shall
lie
with
thee
to
night
for
thy
son’s
mandrakes
30
16
and
jacob
came
out
of
the
field
in
the
evening
and
leah
went
out
to
meet
him
and
said
thou
must
come
in
unto
me
for
surely
i
have
hired
thee
with
my
son’s
mandrakes
and
he
lay
with
her
that
night
30
17
and
god
hearkened
unto
leah
and
she
conceived
and

given
me
my
hire
because
i
have
given
my
maiden
to
my
husband
and
she
called
his
name
issachar
30
19
and
leah
conceived
again
and
bare
jacob
the
sixth
son
30
20
and
leah
said
god
hath
endued
me
with
a
good
dowry
now
will
my
husband
dwell
with
me
because
i
have
born
him
six
sons
and
she
called
his
name
zebulun
30
21
and
afterwards
she
bare
a
daughter
and
called
her
name
dinah
30
22
and
god
remembered
rachel
and
god
hearkened
to
her
and
opened
her
womb
30
23
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
said
god
hath
taken
away
my
reproach
30
24
and
she
called
his
name
joseph
and
said
the
lord
shall
add
to
me
another
son
30
25
and
it
came
to
pass
when
rachel
had
born
joseph
that
jacob
said
unto
laban
send
me
away
that
i
may
go
unto
mine
own
place
and
to
my
country
30
26
give
me
my
wives
and
my
children
for
whom
i
have
served
thee
and
let
me
go
for
thou
knowest
my
service
which
i
have
done
thee
30
27
and
laban
said
unto
him
i
pray
thee
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thine
eyes
tarry
for
i
have
learned
by
experience
that
the
lord
hath
blessed
me
for
thy
sake
30
28
and
he
said
appoint
me
thy
wages
and
i
will
give
it
30
29
and
he
said
unto
him
thou
knowest
how
i
have
served
thee
and
how
thy
cattle
was
with
me
30
30
for
it
was
little
which
thou
hadst
before
i
came
and
it
is
now
increased
unto
a
multitude
and
the
lord
hath
blessed
thee
since
my
coming
and
now
when
shall
i
provide
for
mine
own
house
also
30
31
and
he
said
what
shall
i
give
thee
and
jacob
said
thou
shalt
not
give
me
any
thing
if
thou
wilt
do
this
thing
for
me
i
will
again
feed
and
keep
thy
flock
30
32
i
will
pass
through
all
thy
flock
to
day
removing
from
thence
all
the
speckled
and
spotted
cattle
and
all
the
brown
cattle
among
the
sheep
and
the
spotted
and
speckled
among
the
goats
and
of
such
shall
be
my
hire
30
33
so
shall
my
righteousness
answer
for
me
in
time
to
come
when
it
shall
come
for
my
hire
before
thy
face
every
one
that
is
not
speckled
and
spotted
among
the
goats
and
brown
among
the
sheep
that
shall
be
counted
stolen
with
me
30
34
and
laban
said
behold
i
would
it
might
be
according
to
thy
word
30
35
and
he
removed
that
day
the
he
goats
that
were
ringstraked
and
spotted
and
all
the
she
goats
that
were
speckled
and
spotted
and
every
one
that
had
some
white
in
it
and
all
the
brown
among
the
sheep
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
his
sons
30
36
and
he
set
three
days’
journey
betwixt
himself
and
jacob
and
jacob
fed
the
rest
of
laban’s
flocks
30
37
and
jacob
took
him
rods
of
green
poplar
and
of
the
hazel
and
chestnut
tree
and
pilled
white
strakes
in
them
and
made
the
white
appear
which
was
in
the
rods
30
38
and
he
set
the
rods
which
he
had
pilled
before
the
flocks
in
the
gutters
in
the
watering
troughs
when
the
flocks
came
to
drink
that
they
should
conceive
when
they
came
to
drink
30
39
and
the
flocks
conceived
before
the
rods
and
brought
forth
cattle
ringstraked
speckled
and
spotted
30
40
and
jacob
did
separate
the
lambs
and
set
the
faces
of
the
flocks
toward
the
ringstraked
and
all
the
brown
in
the
flock
of
laban
and
he
put
his
own
flocks
by
themselves
and
put
them
not
unto
laban’s
cattle
30
41
and
it
came
to
pass
whensoever
the
stronger
cattle
did
conceive
that
jacob
laid
the
rods
before
the
eyes
of
the
cattle
in
the
gutters
that
they
might
conceive
among
the
rods
30
42
but
when
the
cattle
were
feeble
he
put
them
not
in
so
the
feebler
were
laban’s
and
the
stronger
jacob’s
30
43
and
the
man
increased
exceedingly
and
had
much
cattle
and
maidservants
and
menservants
and
camels
and
asses
31
1
and
he
heard
the
words
of
laban’s
sons
saying
jacob
hath
taken
away
all
that
was
our
father’s
and
of
that
which
was
our
father’s
hath
he
gotten
all
this
glory
31
2
and
jacob
beheld
the
countenance
of
laban
and
behold
it
was
not
toward
him
as
before
31
3
and
the
lord
said
unto
jacob
return
unto
the
land
of
thy
fathers
and
to
thy
kindred
and
i
will
be
with
thee
31
4
and
jacob
sent
and
called
rachel
and
leah
to
the
field
unto
his
flock
31
5
and
said
unto
them
i
see
your
father’s
countenance
that
it
is
not
toward
me
as
before
but
the
god
of
my
father
hath
been
with
me
31
6
and
ye
know
that
with
all
my
power
i
have
served
your
father
31
7
and
your
father
hath
deceived
me
and
changed
my
wages
ten
times
but
god
suffered
him
not
to
hurt
me
31
8
if
he
said
thus
the
speckled
shall
be
thy
wages
then
all
the
cattle
bare
speckled
and
if
he
said
thus
the
ringstraked
shall
be
thy
hire
then
bare
all
the
cattle
ringstraked
31
9
thus
god
hath
taken
away
the
cattle
of
your
father
and
given
them
to
me
31
10
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
that
the
cattle
conceived
that
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
saw
in
a
dream
and
behold
the
rams
which
leaped
upon
the
cattle
were
ringstraked
speckled
and
grisled
31
11
and
the
angel
of
god
spake
unto
me
in
a
dream
saying
jacob
and
i
said
here
am
i
31
12
and
he
said
lift
up
now
thine
eyes
and
see
all
the
rams
which
leap
upon
the
cattle
are
ringstraked
speckled
and
grisled
for
i
have
seen
all
that
laban
doeth
unto
thee
31
13
i
am
the
god
of
bethel
where
thou
anointedst
the
pillar
and
where
thou
vowedst
a
vow
unto
me
now
arise
get
thee
out
from
this
land
and
return
unto
the
land
of
thy
kindred
31
14
and
rachel
and
leah
answered
and
said
unto
him
is
there
yet
any
portion
or
inheritance
for
us
in
our
father’s
house
31
15
are
we
not
counted
of
him
strangers
for
he
hath
sold
us
and
hath
quite
devoured
also
our
money
31
16
for
all
the
riches
which
god
hath
taken
from
our
father
that
is
ours
and
our
children’s
now
then
whatsoever
god
hath
said
unto
thee
do
31
17
then
jacob
rose
up
and
set
his
sons
and
his
wives
upon
camels
31
18
and
he
carried
away
all
his
cattle
and
all
his
goods
which
he
had
gotten
the
cattle
of
his
getting
which
he
had
gotten
in
padanaram
for
to
go
to
isaac
his
father
in
the
land
of
canaan
31
19
and
laban
went
to
shear
his
sheep
and
rachel
had
stolen
the
images
that
were
her
father’s
31
20
and
jacob
stole
away
unawares
to
laban
the
syrian
in
that
he
told
him
not
that
he
fled
31
21
so
he
fled
with
all
that
he
had
and
he
rose
up
and
passed
over
the
river
and
set
his
face
toward
the
mount
gilead
31
22
and
it
was
told
laban
on
the
third
day
that
jacob
was
fled
31
23
and
he
took
his
brethren
with
him
and
pursued
after
him
seven
days’
journey
and
they
overtook
him
in
the
mount
gilead
31
24
and
god
came
to
laban
the
syrian
in
a
dream
by
night
and
said
unto
him
take
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
jacob
either
good
or
bad
31
25
then
laban
overtook
jacob
now
jacob
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
mount
and
laban
with
his
brethren
pitched
in
the
mount
of
gilead
31
26
and
laban
said
to
jacob
what
hast
thou
done
that
thou
hast
stolen
away
unawares
to
me
and
carried
away
my
daughters
as
captives
taken
with
the
sword
31
27
wherefore
didst
thou
flee
away
secretly
and
steal
away
from
me
and
didst
not
tell
me
that
i
might
have
sent
thee
away
with
mirth
and
with
songs
with
tabret
and
with
harp
31
28
and
hast
not
suffered
me
to
kiss
my
sons
and
my
daughters
thou
hast
now
done
foolishly
in
so
doing
31
29
it
is
in
the
power
of
my
hand
to
do
you
hurt
but
the
god
of
your
father
spake
unto
me
yesternight
saying
take
thou
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
jacob
either
good
or
bad
31
30
and
now
though
thou
wouldest
needs
be
gone
because
thou
sore
longedst
after
thy
father’s
house
yet
wherefore
hast
thou
stolen
my
gods
31
31
and
jacob
answered
and
said
to
laban
because
i
was
afraid
for
i
said
peradventure
thou
wouldest
take
by
force
thy
daughters
from
me
31
32
with
whomsoever
thou
findest
thy
gods
let
him
not
live
before
our
brethren
discern
thou
what
is
thine
with
me
and
take
it
to
thee
for
jacob
knew
not
that
rachel
had
stolen
them
31
33
and
laban
went
into
jacob’s
tent
and
into
leah’s
tent
and
into
the
two
maidservants’
tents
but
he
found
them
not
then
went
he
out
of
leah’s
tent
and
entered
into
rachel’s
tent
31
34
now
rachel
had
taken
the
images
and
put
them
in
the
camel’s
furniture
and
sat
upon
them
and
laban
searched
all
the
tent
but
found
them
not
31
35
and
she
said
to
her
father
let
it
not
displease
my
lord
that
i
cannot
rise
up
before
thee
for
the
custom
of
women
is
upon
me
and
he
searched
but
found
not
the
images
31
36
and
jacob
was
wroth
and
chode
with
laban
and
jacob
answered
and
said
to
laban
what
is
my
trespass
what
is
my
sin
that
thou
hast
so
hotly
pursued
after
me
31
37
whereas
thou
hast
searched
all
my
stuff
what
hast
thou
found
of
all
thy
household
stuff
set
it
here
before
my
brethren
and
thy
brethren
that
they
may
judge
betwixt
us
both
31
38
this
twenty
years
have
i
been
with
thee
thy
ewes
and
thy
she
goats
have
not
cast
their
young
and
the
rams
of
thy
flock
have
i
not
eaten
31
39
that
which
was
torn
of
beasts
i
brought
not
unto
thee
i
bare
the
loss
of
it
of
my
hand
didst
thou
require
it
whether
stolen
by
day
or
stolen
by
night
31
40
thus
i
was
in
the
day
the
drought
consumed
me
and
the
frost
by
night
and
my
sleep
departed
from
mine
eyes
31
41
thus
have
i
been
twenty
years
in
thy
house
i
served
thee
fourteen
years
for
thy
two
daughters
and
six
years
for
thy
cattle
and
thou
hast
changed
my
wages
ten
times
31
42
except
the
god
of
my
father
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
fear
of
isaac
had
been
with
me
surely
thou
hadst
sent
me
away
now
empty
god
hath
seen
mine
affliction
and
the
labour
of
my
hands
and
rebuked
thee
yesternight
31
43
and
laban
answered
and
said
unto
jacob
these
daughters
are
my
daughters
and
these
children
are
my
children
and
these
cattle
are
my
cattle
and
all
that
thou
seest
is
mine
and
what
can
i
do
this
day
unto
these
my
daughters
or
unto
their
children
which
they
have
born
31
44
now
therefore
come
thou
let
us
make
a
covenant
i
and
thou
and
let
it
be
for
a
witness
between
me
and
thee
31
45
and
jacob
took
a
stone
and
set
it
up
for
a
pillar
31
46
and
jacob
said
unto
his
brethren
gather
stones
and
they
took
stones
and
made
an
heap
and
they
did
eat
there
upon
the
heap
31
47
and
laban
called
it
jegarsahadutha
but
jacob
called
it
galeed
31
48
and
laban
said
this
heap
is
a
witness
between
me
and
thee
this
day
therefore
was
the
name
of
it
called
galeed
31
49
and
mizpah
for
he
said
the
lord
watch
between
me
and
thee
when
we
are
absent
one
from
another
31
50
if
thou
shalt
afflict
my
daughters
or
if
thou
shalt
take
other
wives
beside
my
daughters
no
man
is
with
us
see
god
is
witness
betwixt
me
and
thee
31
51
and
laban
said
to
jacob
behold
this
heap
and
behold
this
pillar
which
i
have
cast
betwixt
me
and
thee
31
52
this
heap
be
witness
and
this
pillar
be
witness
that
i
will
not
pass
over
this
heap
to
thee
and
that
thou
shalt
not
pass
over
this
heap
and
this
pillar
unto
me
for
harm
31
53
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
nahor
the
god
of
their
father
judge
betwixt
us
and
jacob
sware
by
the
fear
of
his
father
isaac
31
54
then
jacob
offered
sacrifice
upon
the
mount
and
called
his
brethren
to
eat
bread
and
they
did
eat
bread
and
tarried
all
night
in
the
mount
31
55
and
early
in
the
morning
laban
rose
up
and
kissed
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
blessed
them
and
laban
departed
and
returned
unto
his
place
32
1
and
jacob
went
on
his
way
and
the
angels
of
god
met
him
32
2
and
when
jacob
saw
them
he
said
this
is
god’s
host
and
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
mahanaim
32
3
and
jacob
sent
messengers
before
him
to
esau
his
brother
unto
the
land
of
seir
the
country
of
edom
32
4
and
he
commanded
them
saying
thus
shall
ye
speak
unto
my
lord
esau
thy
servant
jacob
saith
thus
i
have
sojourned
with
laban
and
stayed
there
until
now
32
5
and
i
have
oxen
and
asses
flocks
and
menservants
and
womenservants
and
i
have
sent
to
tell
my
lord
that
i
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight
32
6
and
the
messengers
returned
to
jacob
saying
we
came
to
thy
brother
esau
and
also
he
cometh
to
meet
thee
and
four
hundred
men
with
him
32
7
then
jacob
was
greatly
afraid
and
distressed
and
he
divided
the
people
that
was
with
him
and
the
flocks
and
herds
and
the
camels
into
two
bands
32
8
and
said
if
esau
come
to
the
one
company
and
smite
it
then
the
other
company
which
is
left
shall
escape
32
9
and
jacob
said
o
god
of
my
father
abraham
and
god
of
my
father
isaac
the
lord
which
saidst
unto
me
return
unto
thy
country
and
to
thy
kindred
and
i
will
deal
well
with
thee
32
10
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
least
of
all
the
mercies
and
of
all
the
truth
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant
for
with
my
staff
i
passed
over
this
jordan
and
now
i
am
become
two
bands
32
11
deliver
me
i
pray
thee
from
the
hand
of
my
brother
from
the
hand
of
esau
for
i
fear
him
lest
he
will
come
and
smite
me
and
the
mother
with
the
children
32
12
and
thou
saidst
i
will
surely
do
thee
good
and
make
thy
seed
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
which
cannot
be
numbered
for
multitude
32
13
and
he
lodged
there
that
same
night
and
took
of
that
which
came
to
his
hand
a
present
for
esau
his
brother
32
14
two
hundred
she
goats
and
twenty
he
goats
two
hundred
ewes
and
twenty
rams
32
15
thirty
milch
camels
with
their
colts
forty
kine
and
ten
bulls
twenty
she
asses
and
ten
foals
32
16
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
servants
every
drove
by
themselves
and
said
unto
his
servants
pass
over
before
me
and
put
a
space
betwixt
drove
and
drove
32
17
and
he
commanded
the
foremost
saying
when
esau
my
brother
meeteth
thee
and
asketh
thee
saying
whose
art
thou
and
whither
goest
thou
and
whose
are
these
before
thee
32
18
then
thou
shalt
say
they
be
thy
servant
jacob’s
it
is
a
present
sent
unto
my
lord
esau
and
behold
also
he
is
behind
us
32
19
and
so
commanded
he
the
second
and
the
third
and
all
that
followed
the
droves
saying
on
this
manner
shall
ye
speak
unto
esau
when
ye
find
him
32
20
and
say
ye
moreover
behold
thy
servant
jacob
is
behind
us
for
he
said
i
will
appease
him
with
the
present
that
goeth
before
me
and
afterward
i
will
see
his
face
peradventure
he
will
accept
of
me
32
21
so
went
the
present
over
before
him
and
himself
lodged
that
night
in
the
company
32
22
and
he
rose
up
that
night
and
took
his
two
wives
and
his
two
womenservants
and
his
eleven
sons
and
passed
over
the
ford
jabbok
32
23
and
he
took
them
and
sent
them
over
the
brook
and
sent
over
that
he
had
32
24
and
jacob
was
left
alone
and
there
wrestled
a
man
with
him
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
32
25
and
when
he
saw
that
he
prevailed
not
against
him
he
touched
the
hollow
of
his
thigh
and
the
hollow
of
jacob’s
thigh
was
out
of
joint
as
he
wrestled
with
him
32
26
and
he
said
let
me
go
for
the
day
breaketh
and
he
said
i
will
not
let
thee
go
except
thou
bless
me
32
27
and
he
said
unto
him
what
is
thy
name
and
he
said
jacob
32
28
and
he
said
thy
name
shall
be
called
no
more
jacob
but
israel
for
as
a
prince
hast
thou
power
with
god
and
with
men
and
hast
prevailed
32
29
and
jacob
asked
him
and
said
tell
me
i
pray
thee
thy
name
and
he
said
wherefore
is
it
that
thou
dost
ask
after
my
name
and
he
blessed
him
there
32
30
and
jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
peniel
for
i
have
seen
god
face
to
face
and
my
life
is
preserved
32
31
and
as
he
passed
over
penuel
the
sun
rose
upon
him
and
he
halted
upon
his
thigh
32
32
therefore
the
children
of
israel
eat
not
of
the
sinew
which
shrank
which
is
upon
the
hollow
of
the
thigh
unto
this
day
because
he
touched
the
hollow
of
jacob’s
thigh
in
the
sinew
that
shrank
33
1
and
jacob
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
esau
came
and
with
him
four
hundred
men
and
he
divided
the
children
unto
leah
and
unto
rachel
and
unto
the
two
handmaids
33
2
and
he
put
the
handmaids
and
their
children
foremost
and
leah
and
her
children
after
and
rachel
and
joseph
hindermost
33
3
and
he
passed
over
before
them
and
bowed
himself
to
the
ground
seven
times
until
he
came
near
to
his
brother
33
4
and
esau
ran
to
meet
him
and
embraced
him
and
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
they
wept
33
5
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
women
and
the
children
and
said
who
are
those
with
thee
and
he
said
the
children
which
god
hath
graciously
given
thy
servant
33
6
then
the
handmaidens
came
near
they
and
their
children
and
they
bowed
themselves
33
7
and
leah
also
with
her
children
came
near
and
bowed
themselves
and
after
came
joseph
near
and
rachel
and
they
bowed
themselves
33
8
and
he
said
what
meanest
thou
by
all
this
drove
which
i
met
and
he
said
these
are
to
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord
33
9
and
esau
said
i
have
enough
my
brother
keep
that
thou
hast
unto
thyself
33
10
and
jacob
said
nay
i
pray
thee
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
then
receive
my
present
at
my
hand
for
therefore
i
have
seen
thy
face
as
though
i
had
seen
the
face
of
god
and
thou
wast
pleased
with
me
33
11
take
i
pray
thee
my
blessing
that
is
brought
to
thee
because
god
hath
dealt
graciously
with
me
and
because
i
have
enough
and
he
urged
him
and
he
took
it
33
12
and
he
said
let
us
take
our
journey
and
let
us
go
and
i
will
go
before
thee
33
13
and
he
said
unto
him
my
lord
knoweth
that
the
children
are
tender
and
the
flocks
and
herds
with
young
are
with
me
and
if
men
should
overdrive
them
one
day
all
the
flock
will
die
33
14
let
my
lord
i
pray
thee
pass
over
before
his
servant
and
i
will
lead
on
softly
according
as
the
cattle
that
goeth
before
me
and
the
children
be
able
to
endure
until
i
come
unto
my
lord
unto
seir
33
15
and
esau
said
let
me
now
leave
with
thee
some
of
the
folk
that
are
with
me
and
he
said
what
needeth
it
let
me
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord
33
16
so
esau
returned
that
day
on
his
way
unto
seir
33
17
and
jacob
journeyed
to
succoth
and
built
him
an
house
and
made
booths
for
his
cattle
therefore
the
name
of
the
place
is
called
succoth
33
18
and
jacob
came
to
shalem
a
city
of
shechem
which
is
in
the
land
of
canaan
when
he
came
from
padanaram
and
pitched
his
tent
before
the
city
33
19
and
he
bought
a
parcel
of
a
field
where
he
had
spread
his
tent
at
the
hand
of
the
children
of
hamor
shechem’s
father
for
an
hundred
pieces
of
money
33
20
and
he
erected
there
an
altar
and
called
it
eleloheisrael
34
1
and
dinah
the
daughter
of
leah
which
she
bare
unto
jacob
went
out
to
see
the
daughters
of
the
land
34
2
and
when
shechem
the
son
of
hamor
the
hivite
prince
of
the
country
saw
her
he
took
her
and
lay
with
her
and
defiled
her
34
3
and
his
soul
clave
unto
dinah
the
daughter
of
jacob
and
he
loved
the
damsel
and
spake
kindly
unto
the
damsel
34
4
and
shechem
spake
unto
his
father
hamor
saying
get
me
this
damsel
to
wife
34
5
and
jacob
heard
that
he
had
defiled
dinah
his
daughter
now
his
sons
were
with
his
cattle
in
the
field
and
jacob
held
his
peace
until
they
were
come
34
6
and
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
went
out
unto
jacob
to
commune
with
him
34
7
and
the
sons
of
jacob
came
out
of
the
field
when
they
heard
it
and
the
men
were
grieved
and
they
were
very
wroth
because
he
had
wrought
folly
in
israel
in
lying
with
jacob’s
daughter
which
thing
ought
not
to
be
done
34
8
and
hamor
communed
with
them
saying
the
soul
of
my
son
shechem
longeth
for
your
daughter
i
pray
you
give
her
him
to
wife
34
9
and
make
ye
marriages
with
us
and
give
your
daughters
unto
us
and
take
our
daughters
unto
you
34
10
and
ye
shall
dwell
with
us
and
the
land
shall
be
before
you
dwell
and
trade
ye
therein
and
get
you
possessions
therein
34
11
and
shechem
said
unto
her
father
and
unto
her
brethren
let
me
find
grace
in
your
eyes
and
what
ye
shall
say
unto
me
i
will
give
34
12
ask
me
never
so
much
dowry
and
gift
and
i
will
give
according
as
ye
shall
say
unto
me
but
give
me
the
damsel
to
wife
34
13
and
the
sons
of
jacob
answered
shechem
and
hamor
his
father
deceitfully
and
said
because
he
had
defiled
dinah
their
sister
34
14
and
they
said
unto
them
we
cannot
do
this
thing
to
give
our
sister
to
one
that
is
uncircumcised
for
that
were
a
reproach
unto
us
34
15
but
in
this
will
we
consent
unto
you
if
ye
will
be
as
we
be
that
every
male
of
you
be
circumcised
34
16
then
will
we
give
our
daughters
unto
you
and
we
will
take
your
daughters
to
us
and
we
will
dwell
with
you
and
we
will
become
one
people
34
17
but
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
us
to
be
circumcised
then
will
we
take
our
daughter
and
we
will
be
gone
34
18
and
their
words
pleased
hamor
and
shechem
hamor’s
son
34
19
and
the
young
man
deferred
not
to
do
the
thing
because
he
had
delight
in
jacob’s
daughter
and
he
was
more
honourable
than
all
the
house
of
his
father
34
20
and
hamor
and
shechem
his
son
came
unto
the
gate
of
their
city
and
communed
with
the
men
of
their
city
saying
34
21
these
men
are
peaceable
with
us
therefore
let
them
dwell
in
the
land
and
trade
therein
for
the
land
behold
it
is
large
enough
for
them
let
us
take
their
daughters
to
us
for
wives
and
let
us
give
them
our
daughters
34
22
only
herein
will
the
men
consent
unto
us
for
to
dwell
with
us
to
be
one
people
if
every
male
among
us
be
circumcised
as
they
are
circumcised
34
23
shall
not
their
cattle
and
their
substance
and
every
beast
of
theirs
be
ours
only
let
us
consent
unto
them
and
they
will
dwell
with
us
34
24
and
unto
hamor
and
unto
shechem
his
son
hearkened
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
city
and
every
male
was
circumcised
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
city
34
25
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day
when
they
were
sore
that
two
of
the
sons
of
jacob
simeon
and
levi
dinah’s
brethren
took
each
man
his
sword
and
came
upon
the
city
boldly
and
slew
all
the
males
34
26
and
they
slew
hamor
and
shechem
his
son
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
took
dinah
out
of
shechem’s
house
and
went
out
34
27
the
sons
of
jacob
came
upon
the
slain
and
spoiled
the
city
because
they
had
defiled
their
sister
34
28
they
took
their
sheep
and
their
oxen
and
their
asses
and
that
which
was
in
the
city
and
that
which
was
in
the
field
34
29
and
all
their
wealth
and
all
their
little
ones
and
their
wives
took
they
captive
and
spoiled
even
all
that
was
in
the
house
34
30
and
jacob
said
to
simeon
and
levi
ye
have
troubled
me
to
make
me
to
stink
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
among
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
and
i
being
few
in
number
they
shall
gather
themselves
together
against
me
and
slay
me
and
i
shall
be
destroyed
i
and
my
house
34
31
and
they
said
should
he
deal
with
our
sister
as
with
an
harlot
35
1
and
god
said
unto
jacob
arise
go
up
to
bethel
and
dwell
there
and
make
there
an
altar
unto
god
that
appeared
unto
thee
when
thou
fleddest
from
the
face
of
esau
thy
brother
35
2
then
jacob
said
unto
his
household
and
to
all
that
were
with
him
put
away
the
strange
gods
that
are
among
you
and
be
clean
and
change
your
garments
35
3
and
let
us
arise
and
go
up
to
bethel
and
i
will
make
there
an
altar
unto
god
who
answered
me
in
the
day
of
my
distress
and
was
with
me
in
the
way
which
i
went
35
4
and
they
gave
unto
jacob
all
the
strange
gods
which
were
in
their
hand
and
all
their
earrings
which
were
in
their
ears
and
jacob
hid
them
under
the
oak
which
was
by
shechem
35
5
and
they
journeyed
and
the
terror
of
god
was
upon
the
cities
that
were
round
about
them
and
they
did
not
pursue
after
the
sons
of
jacob
35
6
so
jacob
came
to
luz
which
is
in
the
land
of
canaan
that
is
bethel
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
35
7
and
he
built
there
an
altar
and
called
the
place
elbethel
because
there
god
appeared
unto
him
when
he
fled
from
the
face
of
his
brother
35
8
but
deborah
rebekah’s
nurse
died
and
she
was
buried
beneath
bethel
under
an
oak
and
the
name
of
it
was
called
allonbachuth
35
9
and
god
appeared
unto
jacob
again
when
he
came
out
of
padanaram
and
blessed
him
35
10
and
god
said
unto
him
thy
name
is
jacob
thy
name
shall
not
be
called
any
more
jacob
but
israel
shall
be
thy
name
and
he
called
his
name
israel
35
11
and
god
said
unto
him
i
am
god
almighty
be
fruitful
and
multiply
a
nation
and
a
company
of
nations
shall
be
of
thee
and
kings
shall
come
out
of
thy
loins
35
12
and
the
land
which
i
gave
abraham
and
isaac
to
thee
i
will
give
it
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
will
i
give
the
land
35
13
and
god
went
up
from
him
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him
35
14
and
jacob
set
up
a
pillar
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him
even
a
pillar
of
stone
and
he
poured
a
drink
offering
thereon
and
he
poured
oil
thereon
35
15
and
jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
where
god
spake
with
him
bethel
35
16
and
they
journeyed
from
bethel
and
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
to
ephrath
and
rachel
travailed
and
she
had
hard
labour
35
17
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
was
in
hard
labour
that
the
midwife
said
unto
her
fear
not
thou
shalt
have
this
son
also
35
18
and
it
came
to
pass
as
her
soul
was
in
departing
(for
she
died)
that
she
called
his
name
benoni
but
his
father
called
him
benjamin
35
19
and
rachel
died
and
was
buried
in
the
way
to
ephrath
which
is
bethlehem
35
20
and
jacob
set
a
pillar
upon
her
grave
that
is
the
pillar
of
rachel’s
grave
unto
this
day
35
21
and
israel
journeyed
and
spread
his
tent
beyond
the
tower
of
edar
35
22
and
it
came
to
pass
when
israel
dwelt
in
that
land
that
reuben
went
and
lay
with
bilhah
his
father’s
concubine
and
israel
heard
it
now
the
sons
of
jacob
were
twelve
35
23
the
sons
of
leah
reuben
jacob’s
firstborn
and

these
are
the
generations
of
jacob
joseph
being
seventeen
years
old
was
feeding
the
flock
with
his
brethren
and
the
lad
was
with
the
sons
of
bilhah
and
with
the
sons
of
zilpah
his
father’s
wives
and
joseph
brought
unto
his
father
their
evil
report
37
3
now
israel
loved
joseph
more
than
all
his
children
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
old
age
and
he
made
him
a
coat
of
many
colours
37
4
and
when
his
brethren
saw
that
their
father
loved
him
more
than
all
his
brethren
they
hated
him
and
could
not
speak
peaceably
unto
him
37
5
and
joseph
dreamed
a
dream
and
he
told
it
his
brethren
and
they
hated
him
yet
the
more
37
6
and
he
said
unto
them
hear
i
pray
you
this
dream
which
i
have
dreamed
37
7
for
behold
we
were
binding
sheaves
in
the
field
and
lo
my
sheaf
arose
and
also
stood
upright
and
behold
your
sheaves
stood
round
about
and
made
obeisance
to
my
sheaf
37
8
and
his
brethren
said
to
him
shalt
thou
indeed
reign
over
us
or
shalt
thou
indeed
have
dominion
over
us
and
they
hated
him
yet
the
more
for
his
dreams
and
for
his
words
37
9
and
he
dreamed
yet
another
dream
and
told
it
his
brethren
and
said
behold
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
more
and
behold
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
eleven
stars
made
obeisance
to
me
37
10
and
he
told
it
to
his
father
and
to
his
brethren
and
his
father
rebuked
him
and
said
unto
him
what
is
this
dream
that
thou
hast
dreamed
shall
i
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
indeed
come
to
bow
down
ourselves
to
thee
to
the
earth
37
11
and
his
brethren
envied
him
but
his
father
observed
the
saying
37
12
and
his
brethren
went
to
feed
their
father’s
flock
in
shechem
37
13
and
israel
said
unto
joseph
do
not
thy
brethren
feed
the
flock
in
shechem
come
and
i
will
send
thee
unto
them
and
he
said
to
him
here
am
i
37
14
and
he
said
to
him
go
i
pray
thee
see
whether
it
be
well
with
thy
brethren
and
well
with
the
flocks
and
bring
me
word
again
so
he
sent
him
out
of
the
vale
of
hebron
and
he
came
to
shechem
37
15
and
a
certain
man
found
him
and
behold
he
was
wandering
in
the
field
and
the
man
asked
him
saying
what
seekest
thou
37
16
and
he
said
i
seek
my
brethren
tell
me
i
pray
thee
where
they
feed
their
flocks
37
17
and
the
man
said
they
are
departed
hence
for
i
heard
them
say
let
us
go
to
dothan
and
joseph
went
after
his
brethren
and
found
them
in
dothan
37
18
and
when
they
saw
him
afar
off
even
before
he
came
near
unto
them
they
conspired
against
him
to
slay
him
37
19
and
they
said
one
to
another
behold
this
dreamer
cometh
37
20
come
now
therefore
and
let
us
slay
him
and
cast
him
into
some
pit
and
we
will
say
some
evil
beast
hath
devoured
him
and
we
shall
see
what
will
become
of
his
dreams
37
21
and
reuben
heard
it
and
he
delivered
him
out
of
their
hands
and
said
let
us
not
kill
him
37
22
and
reuben
said
unto
them
shed
no
blood
but
cast
him
into
this
pit
that
is
in
the
wilderness
and
lay
no
hand
upon
him
that
he
might
rid
him
out
of
their
hands
to
deliver
him
to
his
father
again
37
23
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joseph
was
come
unto
his
brethren
that
they
stript
joseph
out
of
his
coat
his
coat
of
many
colours
that
was
on
him
37
24
and
they
took
him
and
cast
him
into
a
pit
and
the
pit
was
empty
there
was
no
water
in
it
37
25
and
they
sat
down
to
eat
bread
and
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
company
of
ishmeelites
came
from
gilead
with
their
camels
bearing
spicery
and
balm
and
myrrh
going
to
carry
it
down
to
egypt
37
26
and
judah
said
unto
his
brethren
what
profit
is
it
if
we
slay
our
brother
and
conceal
his
blood
37
27
come
and
let
us
sell
him
to
the
ishmeelites
and
let
not
our
hand
be
upon
him
for
he
is
our
brother
and
our
flesh
and
his
brethren
were
content
37
28
then
there
passed
by
midianites
merchantmen
and
they
drew
and
lifted
up
joseph
out
of
the
pit
and
sold
joseph
to
the
ishmeelites
for
twenty
pieces
of
silver
and
they
brought
joseph
into
egypt
37
29
and
reuben
returned
unto
the
pit
and
behold
joseph
was
not
in
the
pit
and
he
rent
his
clothes
37
30
and
he
returned
unto
his
brethren
and
said
the
child
is
not
and
i
whither
shall
i
go
37
31
and
they
took
joseph’s
coat
and
killed
a
kid
of
the
goats
and
dipped
the
coat
in
the
blood
37
32
and
they
sent
the
coat
of
many
colours
and
they
brought
it
to
their
father
and
said
this
have
we
found
know
now
whether
it
be
thy
son’s
coat
or
no
37
33
and
he
knew
it
and
said
it
is
my
son’s
coat
an
evil
beast
hath
devoured
him
joseph
is
without
doubt
rent
in
pieces
37
34
and
jacob
rent
his
clothes
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
loins
and
mourned
for
his
son
many
days
37
35
and
all
his
sons
and
all
his
daughters
rose
up
to
comfort
him
but
he
refused
to
be
comforted
and
he
said
for
i
will
go
down
into
the
grave
unto
my
son
mourning
thus
his
father
wept
for
him
37
36
and
the
midianites
sold
him
into
egypt
unto
potiphar
an
officer
of
pharaoh’s
and
captain
of
the
guard
38
1
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
that
judah
went
down
from
his
brethren
and
turned
in
to
a
certain
adullamite
whose
name
was
hirah
38
2
and
judah
saw
there
a
daughter
of
a
certain
canaanite
whose
name
was
shuah
and
he
took
her
and
went
in
unto
her
38
3
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
he
called
his
name
er
38
4
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
son
and
she
called
his
name
onan
38
5
and
she
yet
again
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
shelah
and
he
was
at
chezib
when
she
bare
him
38
6
and
judah
took
a
wife
for
er
his
firstborn
whose
name
was
tamar
38
7
and
er
judah’s
firstborn
was
wicked
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
slew
him
38
8
and
judah
said
unto
onan
go
in
unto
thy
brother’s
wife
and
marry
her
and
raise
up
seed
to
thy
brother
38
9
and
onan
knew
that
the
seed
should
not
be
his
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
went
in
unto
his
brother’s
wife
that
he
spilled
it
on
the
ground
lest
that
he
should
give
seed
to
his
brother
38
10
and
the
thing
which
he
did
displeased
the
lord
wherefore
he
slew
him
also
38
11
then
said
judah
to
tamar
his
daughter
in
law
remain
a
widow
at
thy
father’s
house
till
shelah
my
son
be
grown
for
he
said
lest
peradventure
he
die
also
as
his
brethren
did
and
tamar
went
and
dwelt
in
her
father’s
house
38
12
and
in
process
of
time
the
daughter
of
shuah
judah’s
wife
died
and
judah
was
comforted
and
went
up
unto
his
sheepshearers
to
timnath
he
and
his
friend
hirah
the
adullamite
38
13
and
it
was
told
tamar
saying
behold
thy
father
in
law
goeth
up
to
timnath
to
shear
his
sheep
38
14
and
she
put
her
widow’s
garments
off
from
her
and
covered
her
with
a
vail
and
wrapped
herself
and
sat
in
an
open
place
which
is
by
the
way
to
timnath
for
she
saw
that
shelah
was
grown
and
she
was
not
given
unto
him
to
wife
38
15
when
judah
saw
her
he
thought
her
to
be
an
harlot
because
she
had
covered
her
face
38
16
and
he
turned
unto
her
by
the
way
and
said
go
to
i
pray
thee
let
me
come
in
unto
thee
(for
he
knew
not
that
she
was
his
daughter
in
law
)
and
she
said
what
wilt
thou
give
me
that
thou
mayest
come
in
unto
me
38
17
and
he
said
i
will
send
thee
a
kid
from
the
flock
and
she
said
wilt
thou
give
me
a
pledge
till
thou
send
it
38
18
and
he
said
what
pledge
shall
i
give
thee
and
she
said
thy
signet
and
thy
bracelets
and
thy
staff
that
is
in
thine
hand
and
he
gave
it
her
and
came
in
unto
her
and
she
conceived
by
him
38
19
and
she
arose
and
went
away
and
laid
by
her
vail
from
her
and
put
on
the
garments
of
her
widowhood
38
20
and
judah
sent
the
kid
by
the
hand
of
his
friend
the
adullamite
to
receive
his
pledge
from
the
woman’s
hand
but
he
found
her
not
38
21
then
he
asked
the
men
of
that
place
saying
where
is
the
harlot
that
was
openly
by
the
way
side
and
they
said
there
was
no
harlot
in
this
place
38
22
and
he
returned
to
judah
and
said
i
cannot
find
her
and
also
the
men
of
the
place
said
that
there
was
no
harlot
in
this
place
38
23
and
judah
said
let
her
take
it
to
her
lest
we
be
shamed
behold
i
sent
this
kid
and
thou
hast
not
found
her
38
24
and
it
came
to
pass
about
three
months
after
that
it
was
told
judah
saying
tamar
thy
daughter
in
law
hath
played
the
harlot
and
also
behold
she
is
with
child
by
whoredom
and
judah
said
bring
her
forth
and
let
her
be
burnt
38
25
when
she
was
brought
forth
she
sent
to
her
father
in
law
saying
by
the
man
whose
these
are
am
i
with
child
and
she
said
discern
i
pray
thee
whose
are
these
the
signet
and
bracelets
and
staff
38
26
and
judah
acknowledged
them
and
said
she
hath
been
more
righteous
than
i
because
that
i
gave
her
not
to
shelah
my
son
and
he
knew
her
again
no
more
38
27
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
time
of
her
travail
that
behold
twins
were
in
her
womb
38
28
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
travailed
that
the
one
put
out
his
hand
and
the
midwife
took
and
bound
upon
his
hand
a
scarlet
thread
saying
this
came
out
first
38
29
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
drew
back
his
hand
that
behold
his
brother
came
out
and
she
said
how
hast
thou
broken
forth
this
breach
be
upon
thee
therefore
his
name
was
called
pharez
38
30
and
afterward
came
out
his
brother
that
had
the
scarlet
thread
upon
his
hand
and
his
name
was
called
zarah
39
1
and
joseph
was
brought
down
to
egypt
and
potiphar
an
officer
of
pharaoh
captain
of
the
guard
an
egyptian
bought
him
of
the
hands
of
the
ishmeelites
which
had
brought
him
down
thither
39
2
and
the
lord
was
with
joseph
and
he
was
a
prosperous
man
and
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
master
the
egyptian
39
3
and
his
master
saw
that
the
lord
was
with
him
and
that
the
lord
made
all
that
he
did
to
prosper
in
his
hand
39
4
and
joseph
found
grace
in
his
sight
and
he
served
him
and
he
made
him
overseer
over
his
house
and
all
that
he
had
he
put
into
his
hand
39
5
and
it
came
to
pass
from
the
time
that
he
had
made
him
overseer
in
his
house
and
over
all
that
he
had
that
the
lord
blessed
the
egyptian’s
house
for
joseph’s
sake
and
the
blessing
of
the
lord
was
upon
all
that
he
had
in
the
house
and
in
the
field
39
6
and
he
left
all
that
he
had
in
joseph’s
hand
and
he
knew
not
ought
he
had
save
the
bread
which
he
did
eat
and
joseph
was
a
goodly
person
and
well
favoured
39
7
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
his
master’s
wife
cast
her
eyes
upon
joseph
and
she
said
lie
with
me
39
8
but
he
refused
and
said
unto
his
master’s
wife
behold
my
master
wotteth
not
what
is
with
me
in
the
house
and
he
hath
committed
all
that
he
hath
to
my
hand
39
9
there
is
none
greater
in
this
house
than
i
neither
hath
he
kept
back
any
thing
from
me
but
thee
because
thou
art
his
wife
how
then
can
i
do
this
great
wickedness
and
sin
against
god
39
10
and
it
came
to
pass
as
she
spake
to
joseph
day
by
day
that
he
hearkened
not
unto
her
to
lie
by
her
or
to
be
with
her
39
11
and
it
came
to
pass
about
this
time
that
joseph
went
into
the
house
to
do
his
business
and
there
was
none
of
the
men
of
the
house
there
within
39
12
and
she
caught
him
by
his
garment
saying
lie
with
me
and
he
left
his
garment
in
her
hand
and
fled
and
got
him
out
39
13
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
saw
that
he
had
left
his
garment
in
her
hand
and
was
fled
forth
39
14
that
she
called
unto
the
men
of
her
house
and
spake
unto
them
saying
see
he
hath
brought
in
an
hebrew
unto
us
to
mock
us
he
came
in
unto
me
to
lie
with
me
and
i
cried
with
a
loud
voice
39
15
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
heard
that
i
lifted
up
my
voice
and
cried
that
he
left
his
garment
with
me
and
fled
and
got
him
out
39
16
and
she
laid
up
his
garment
by
her
until
his
lord
came
home
39
17
and
she
spake
unto
him
according
to
these
words
saying
the
hebrew
servant
which
thou
hast
brought
unto
us
came
in
unto
me
to
mock
me
39
18
and
it
came
to
pass
as
i
lifted
up
my
voice
and
cried
that
he
left
his
garment
with
me
and
fled
out
39
19
and
it
came
to
pass
when
his
master
heard
the
words
of
his
wife
which
she
spake
unto
him
saying
after
this
manner
did
thy
servant
to
me
that
his
wrath
was
kindled
39
20
and
joseph’s
master
took
him
and
put
him
into
the
prison
a
place
where
the
king’s
prisoners
were
bound
and
he
was
there
in
the
prison
39
21
but
the
lord
was
with
joseph
and
shewed
him
mercy
and
gave
him
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
keeper
of
the
prison
39
22
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
committed
to
joseph’s
hand
all
the
prisoners
that
were
in
the
prison
and
whatsoever
they
did
there
he
was
the
doer
of
it
39
23
the
keeper
of
the
prison
looked
not
to
any
thing
that
was
under
his
hand
because
the
lord
was
with
him
and
that
which
he
did
the
lord
made
it
to
prosper
40
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
the
butler
of
the
king
of
egypt
and
his
baker
had
offended
their
lord
the
king
of
egypt
40
2
and
pharaoh
was
wroth
against
two
of
his
officers
against
the
chief
of
the
butlers
and
against
the
chief
of
the
bakers
40
3
and
he
put
them
in
ward
in
the
house
of
the
captain
of
the
guard
into
the
prison
the
place
where
joseph
was
bound
40
4
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
charged
joseph
with
them
and
he
served
them
and
they
continued
a
season
in
ward
40
5
and
they
dreamed
a
dream
both
of
them
each
man
his
dream
in
one
night
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
dream
the
butler
and
the
baker
of
the
king
of
egypt
which
were
bound
in
the
prison
40
6
and
joseph
came
in
unto
them
in
the
morning
and
looked
upon
them
and
behold
they
were
sad
40
7
and
he
asked
pharaoh’s
officers
that
were
with
him
in
the
ward
of
his
lord’s
house
saying
wherefore
look
ye
so
sadly
to
day
40
8
and
they
said
unto
him
we
have
dreamed
a
dream
and
there
is
no
interpreter
of
it
and
joseph
said
unto
them
do
not
interpretations
belong
to
god
tell
me
them
i
pray
you
40
9
and
the
chief
butler
told
his
dream
to
joseph
and
said
to
him
in
my
dream
behold
a
vine
was
before
me
40
10
and
in
the
vine
were
three
branches
and
it
was
as
though
it
budded
and
her
blossoms
shot
forth
and
the
clusters
thereof
brought
forth
ripe
grapes
40
11
and
pharaoh’s
cup
was
in
my
hand
and
i
took
the
grapes
and
pressed
them
into
pharaoh’s
cup
and
i
gave
the
cup
into
pharaoh’s
hand
40
12
and
joseph
said
unto
him
this
is
the
interpretation
of
it
the
three
branches
are
three
days
40
13
yet
within
three
days
shall
pharaoh
lift
up
thine
head
and
restore
thee
unto
thy
place
and
thou
shalt
deliver
pharaoh’s
cup
into
his
hand
after
the
former
manner
when
thou
wast
his
butler
40
14
but
think
on
me
when
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
and
shew
kindness
i
pray
thee
unto
me
and
make
mention
of
me
unto
pharaoh
and
bring
me
out
of
this
house
40
15
for
indeed
i
was
stolen
away
out
of
the
land
of
the
hebrews
and
here
also
have
i
done
nothing
that
they
should
put
me
into
the
dungeon
40
16
when
the
chief
baker
saw
that
the
interpretation
was
good
he
said
unto
joseph
i
also
was
in
my
dream
and
behold
i
had
three
white
baskets
on
my
head
40
17
and
in
the
uppermost
basket
there
was
of
all
manner
of
bakemeats
for
pharaoh
and
the
birds
did
eat
them
out
of
the
basket
upon
my
head
40
18
and
joseph
answered
and
said
this
is
the
interpretation
thereof
the
three
baskets
are
three
days
40
19
yet
within
three
days
shall
pharaoh
lift
up
thy
head
from
off
thee
and
shall
hang
thee
on
a
tree
and
the
birds
shall
eat
thy
flesh
from
off
thee
40
20
and
it
came
to
pass
the
third
day
which
was
pharaoh’s
birthday
that
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
servants
and
he
lifted
up
the
head
of
the
chief
butler
and
of
the
chief
baker
among
his
servants
40
21
and
he
restored
the
chief
butler
unto
his
butlership
again
and
he
gave
the
cup
into
pharaoh’s
hand
40
22
but
he
hanged
the
chief
baker
as
joseph
had
interpreted
to
them
40
23
yet
did
not
the
chief
butler
remember
joseph
but
forgat
him
41
1
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
full
years
that
pharaoh
dreamed
and
behold
he
stood
by
the
river
41
2
and
behold
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
well
favoured
kine
and
fatfleshed
and
they
fed
in
a
meadow
41
3
and
behold
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
them
out
of
the
river
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
and
stood
by
the
other
kine
upon
the
brink
of
the
river
41
4
and
the
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
kine
did
eat
up
the
seven
well
favoured
and
fat
kine
so
pharaoh
awoke
41
5
and
he
slept
and
dreamed
the
second
time
and
behold
seven
ears
of
corn
came
up
upon
one
stalk
rank
and
good
41
6
and
behold
seven
thin
ears
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
up
after
them
41
7
and
the
seven
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
rank
and
full
ears
and
pharaoh
awoke
and
behold
it
was
a
dream
41
8
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
his
spirit
was
troubled
and
he
sent
and
called
for
all
the
magicians
of
egypt
and
all
the
wise
men
thereof
and
pharaoh
told
them
his
dream
but
there
was
none
that
could
interpret
them
unto
pharaoh
41
9
then
spake
the
chief
butler
unto
pharaoh
saying
i
do
remember
my
faults
this
day
41
10
pharaoh
was
wroth
with
his
servants
and
put
me
in
ward
in
the
captain
of
the
guard’s
house
both
me
and
the
chief
baker
41
11
and
we
dreamed
a
dream
in
one
night
i
and
he
we
dreamed
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
dream
41
12
and
there
was
there
with
us
a
young
man
an
hebrew
servant
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
and
we
told
him
and
he
interpreted
to
us
our
dreams
to
each
man
according
to
his
dream
he
did
interpret
41
13
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
interpreted
to
us
so
it
was
me
he
restored
unto
mine
office
and
him
he
hanged
41
14
then
pharaoh
sent
and
called
joseph
and
they
brought
him
hastily
out
of
the
dungeon
and
he
shaved
himself
and
changed
his
raiment
and
came
in
unto
pharaoh
41
15
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
and
there
is
none
that
can
interpret
it
and
i
have
heard
say
of
thee
that
thou
canst
understand
a
dream
to
interpret
it
41
16
and
joseph
answered
pharaoh
saying
it
is
not
in
me
god
shall
give
pharaoh
an
answer
of
peace
41
17
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
in
my
dream
behold
i
stood
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
41
18
and
behold
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
kine
fatfleshed
and
well
favoured
and
they
fed
in
a
meadow
41
19
and
behold
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
them
poor
and
very
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
such
as
i
never
saw
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
for
badness
41
20
and
the
lean
and
the
ill
favoured
kine
did
eat
up
the
first
seven
fat
kine
41
21
and
when
they
had
eaten
them
up
it
could
not
be
known
that
they
had
eaten
them
but
they
were
still
ill
favoured
as
at
the
beginning
so
i
awoke
41
22
and
i
saw
in
my
dream
and
behold
seven
ears
came
up
in
one
stalk
full
and
good
41
23
and
behold
seven
ears
withered
thin
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
up
after
them
41
24
and
the
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
good
ears
and
i
told
this
unto
the
magicians
but
there
was
none
that
could
declare
it
to
me
41
25
and
joseph
said
unto
pharaoh
the
dream
of
pharaoh
is
one
god
hath
shewed
pharaoh
what
he
is
about
to
do
41
26
the
seven
good
kine
are
seven
years
and
the
seven
good
ears
are
seven
years
the
dream
is
one
41
27
and
the
seven
thin
and
ill
favoured
kine
that
came
up
after
them
are
seven
years
and
the
seven
empty
ears
blasted
with
the
east
wind
shall
be
seven
years
of
famine
41
28
this
is
the
thing
which
i
have
spoken
unto
pharaoh
what
god
is
about
to
do
he
sheweth
unto
pharaoh
41
29
behold
there
come
seven
years
of
great
plenty
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
30
and
there
shall
arise
after
them
seven
years
of
famine
and
all
the
plenty
shall
be
forgotten
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
famine
shall
consume
the
land
41
31
and
the
plenty
shall
not
be
known
in
the
land
by
reason
of
that
famine
following
for
it
shall
be
very
grievous
41
32
and
for
that
the
dream
was
doubled
unto
pharaoh
twice
it
is
because
the
thing
is
established
by
god
and
god
will
shortly
bring
it
to
pass
41
33
now
therefore
let
pharaoh
look
out
a
man
discreet
and
wise
and
set
him
over
the
land
of
egypt
41
34
let
pharaoh
do
this
and
let
him
appoint
officers
over
the
land
and
take
up
the
fifth
part
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
seven
plenteous
years
41
35
and
let
them
gather
all
the
food
of
those
good
years
that
come
and
lay
up
corn
under
the
hand
of
pharaoh
and
let
them
keep
food
in
the
cities
41
36
and
that
food
shall
be
for
store
to
the
land
against
the
seven
years
of
famine
which
shall
be
in
the
land
of
egypt
that
the
land
perish
not
through
the
famine
41
37
and
the
thing
was
good
in
the
eyes
of
pharaoh
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
his
servants
41
38
and
pharaoh
said
unto
his
servants
can
we
find
such
a
one
as
this
is
a
man
in
whom
the
spirit
of
god
is
41
39
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
forasmuch
as
god
hath
shewed
thee
all
this
there
is
none
so
discreet
and
wise
as
thou
art
41
40
thou
shalt
be
over
my
house
and
according
unto
thy
word
shall
all
my
people
be
ruled
only
in
the
throne
will
i
be
greater
than
thou
41
41
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
see
i
have
set
thee
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
42
and
pharaoh
took
off
his
ring
from
his
hand
and
put
it
upon
joseph’s
hand
and
arrayed
him
in
vestures
of
fine
linen
and
put
a
gold
chain
about
his
neck
41
43
and
he
made
him
to
ride
in
the
second
chariot
which
he
had
and
they
cried
before
him
bow
the
knee
and
he
made
him
ruler
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
44
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
i
am
pharaoh
and
without
thee
shall
no
man
lift
up
his
hand
or
foot
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
45
and
pharaoh
called
joseph’s
name
zaphnathpaaneah
and
he
gave
him
to
wife
asenath
the
daughter
of
potipherah
priest
of
on
and
joseph
went
out
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
46
and
joseph
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
stood
before
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
joseph
went
out
from
the
presence
of
pharaoh
and
went
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
41
47
and
in
the
seven
plenteous
years
the
earth
brought
forth
by
handfuls
41
48
and
he
gathered
up
all
the
food
of
the
seven
years
which
were
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
laid
up
the
food
in
the
cities
the
food
of
the
field
which
was
round
about
every
city
laid
he
up
in
the
same
41
49
and
joseph
gathered
corn
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
very
much
until
he
left
numbering
for
it
was
without
number
41
50
and
unto
joseph
were
born
two
sons
before
the
years
of
famine
came
which
asenath
the
daughter
of
potipherah
priest
of
on
bare
unto
him
41
51
and
joseph
called
the
name
of
the
firstborn
manasseh
for
god
said
he
hath
made
me
forget
all
my
toil
and
all
my
father’s
house
41
52
and
the
name
of
the
second
called
he
ephraim
for
god
hath
caused
me
to
be
fruitful
in
the
land
of
my
affliction
41
53
and
the
seven
years
of
plenteousness
that
was
in
the
land
of
egypt
were
ended
41
54
and
the
seven
years
of
dearth
began
to
come
according
as
joseph
had
said
and
the
dearth
was
in
all
lands
but
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
there
was
bread
41
55
and
when
all
the
land
of
egypt
was
famished
the
people
cried
to
pharaoh
for
bread
and
pharaoh
said
unto
all
the
egyptians
go
unto
joseph
what
he
saith
to
you
do
41
56
and
the
famine
was
over
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
joseph
opened
all
the
storehouses
and
sold
unto
the
egyptians
and
the
famine
waxed
sore
in
the
land
of
egypt
41
57
and
all
countries
came
into
egypt
to
joseph
for
to
buy
corn
because
that
the
famine
was
so
sore
in
all
lands
42
1
now
when
jacob
saw
that
there
was
corn
in
egypt
jacob
said
unto
his
sons
why
do
ye
look
one
upon
another
42
2
and
he
said
behold
i
have
heard
that
there
is
corn
in
egypt
get
you
down
thither
and
buy
for
us
from
thence
that
we
may
live
and
not
die
42
3
and
joseph’s
ten
brethren
went
down
to
buy
corn
in
egypt
42
4
but
benjamin
joseph’s
brother
jacob
sent
not
with
his
brethren
for
he
said
lest
peradventure
mischief
befall
him
42
5
and
the
sons
of
israel
came
to
buy
corn
among
those
that
came
for
the
famine
was
in
the
land
of
canaan
42
6
and
joseph
was
the
governor
over
the
land
and
he
it
was
that
sold
to
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
joseph’s
brethren
came
and
bowed
down
themselves
before
him
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
42
7
and
joseph
saw
his
brethren
and
he
knew
them
but
made
himself
strange
unto
them
and
spake
roughly
unto
them
and
he
said
unto
them
whence
come
ye
and
they
said
from
the
land
of
canaan
to
buy
food
42
8
and
joseph
knew
his
brethren
but
they
knew
not
him
42
9
and
joseph
remembered
the
dreams
which
he
dreamed
of
them
and
said
unto
them
ye
are
spies
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
come
42
10
and
they
said
unto
him
nay
my
lord
but
to
buy
food
are
thy
servants
come
42
11
we
are
all
one
man’s
sons
we
are
true
men
thy
servants
are
no
spies
42
12
and
he
said
unto
them
nay
but
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
come
42
13
and
they
said
thy
servants
are
twelve
brethren
the
sons
of
one
man
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
behold
the
youngest
is
this
day
with
our
father
and
one
is
not
42
14
and
joseph
said
unto
them
that
is
it
that
i
spake
unto
you
saying
ye
are
spies
42
15
hereby
ye
shall
be
proved
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
ye
shall
not
go
forth
hence
except
your
youngest
brother
come
hither
42
16
send
one
of
you
and
let
him
fetch
your
brother
and
ye
shall
be
kept
in
prison
that
your
words
may
be
proved
whether
there
be
any
truth
in
you
or
else
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
surely
ye
are
spies
42
17
and
he
put
them
all
together
into
ward
three
days
42
18
and
joseph
said
unto
them
the
third
day
this
do
and
live
for
i
fear
god
42
19
if
ye
be
true
men
let
one
of
your
brethren
be
bound
in
the
house
of
your
prison
go
ye
carry
corn
for
the
famine
of
your
houses
42
20
but
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
me
so
shall
your
words
be
verified
and
ye
shall
not
die
and
they
did
so
42
21
and
they
said
one
to
another
we
are
verily
guilty
concerning
our
brother
in
that
we
saw
the
anguish
of
his
soul
when
he
besought
us
and
we
would
not
hear
therefore
is
this
distress
come
upon
us
42
22
and
reuben
answered
them
saying
spake
i
not
unto
you
saying
do
not
sin
against
the
child
and
ye
would
not
hear
therefore
behold
also
his
blood
is
required
42
23
and
they
knew
not
that
joseph
understood
them
for
he
spake
unto
them
by
an
interpreter
42
24
and
he
turned
himself
about
from
them
and
wept
and
returned
to
them
again
and
communed
with
them
and
took
from
them
simeon
and
bound
him
before
their
eyes
42
25
then
joseph
commanded
to
fill
their
sacks
with
corn
and
to
restore
every
man’s
money
into
his
sack
and
to
give
them
provision
for
the
way
and
thus
did
he
unto
them
42
26
and
they
laded
their
asses
with
the
corn
and
departed
thence
42
27
and
as
one
of
them
opened
his
sack
to
give
his
ass
provender
in
the
inn
he
espied
his
money
for
behold
it
was
in
his
sack’s
mouth
42
28
and
he
said
unto
his
brethren
my
money
is
restored
and
lo
it
is
even
in
my
sack
and
their
heart
failed
them
and
they
were
afraid
saying
one
to
another
what
is
this
that
god
hath
done
unto
us
42
29
and
they
came
unto
jacob
their
father
unto
the
land
of
canaan
and
told
him
all
that
befell
unto
them
saying
42
30
the
man
who
is
the
lord
of
the
land
spake
roughly
to
us
and
took
us
for
spies
of
the
country
42
31
and
we
said
unto
him
we
are
true
men
we
are
no
spies
42
32
we
be
twelve
brethren
sons
of
our
father
one
is
not
and
the
youngest
is
this
day
with
our
father
in
the
land
of
canaan
42
33
and
the
man
the
lord
of
the
country
said
unto
us
hereby
shall
i
know
that
ye
are
true
men
leave
one
of
your
brethren
here
with
me
and
take
food
for
the
famine
of
your
households
and
be
gone
42
34
and
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
me
then
shall
i
know
that
ye
are
no
spies
but
that
ye
are
true
men
so
will
i
deliver
you
your
brother
and
ye
shall
traffick
in
the
land
42
35
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
emptied
their
sacks
that
behold
every
man’s
bundle
of
money
was
in
his
sack
and
when
both
they
and
their
father
saw
the
bundles
of
money
they
were
afraid
42
36
and
jacob
their
father
said
unto
them
me
have
ye
bereaved
of
my
children
joseph
is
not
and
simeon
is
not
and
ye
will
take
benjamin
away
all
these
things
are
against
me
42
37
and
reuben
spake
unto
his
father
saying
slay
my
two
sons
if
i
bring
him
not
to
thee
deliver
him
into
my
hand
and
i
will
bring
him
to
thee
again
42
38
and
he
said
my
son
shall
not
go
down
with
you
for
his
brother
is
dead
and
he
is
left
alone
if
mischief
befall
him
by
the
way
in
the
which
ye
go
then
shall
ye
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
43
1
and
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
land
43
2
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
eaten
up
the
corn
which
they
had
brought
out
of
egypt
their
father
said
unto
them
go
again
buy
us
a
little
food
43
3
and
judah
spake
unto
him
saying
the
man
did
solemnly
protest
unto
us
saying
ye
shall
not
see
my
face
except
your
brother
be
with
you
43
4
if
thou
wilt
send
our
brother
with
us
we
will
go
down
and
buy
thee
food
43
5
but
if
thou
wilt
not
send
him
we
will
not
go
down
for
the
man
said
unto
us
ye
shall
not
see
my
face
except
your
brother
be
with
you
43
6
and
israel
said
wherefore
dealt
ye
so
ill
with
me
as
to
tell
the
man
whether
ye
had
yet
a
brother
43
7
and
they
said
the
man
asked
us
straitly
of
our
state
and
of
our
kindred
saying
is
your
father
yet
alive
have
ye
another
brother
and
we
told
him
according
to
the
tenor
of
these
words
could
we
certainly
know
that
he
would
say
bring
your
brother
down
43
8
and
judah
said
unto
israel
his
father
send
the
lad
with
me
and
we
will
arise
and
go
that
we
may
live
and
not
die
both
we
and
thou
and
also
our
little
ones
43
9
i
will
be
surety
for
him
of
my
hand
shalt
thou
require
him
if
i
bring
him
not
unto
thee
and
set
him
before
thee
then
let
me
bear
the
blame
for
ever
43
10
for
except
we
had
lingered
surely
now
we
had
returned
this
second
time
43
11
and
their
father
israel
said
unto
them
if
it
must
be
so
now
do
this
take
of
the
best
fruits
in
the
land
in
your
vessels
and
carry
down
the
man
a
present
a
little
balm
and
a
little
honey
spices
and
myrrh
nuts
and
almonds
43
12
and
take
double
money
in
your
hand
and
the
money
that
was
brought
again
in
the
mouth
of
your
sacks
carry
it
again
in
your
hand
peradventure
it
was
an
oversight
43
13
take
also
your
brother
and
arise
go
again
unto
the
man
43
14
and
god
almighty
give
you
mercy
before
the
man
that
he
may
send
away
your
other
brother
and
benjamin
if
i
be
bereaved
of
my
children
i
am
bereaved
43
15
and
the
men
took
that
present
and
they
took
double
money
in
their
hand
and
benjamin
and
rose
up
and
went
down
to
egypt
and
stood
before
joseph
43
16
and
when
joseph
saw
benjamin
with
them
he
said
to
the
ruler
of
his
house
bring
these
men
home
and
slay
and
make
ready
for
these
men
shall
dine
with
me
at
noon
43
17
and
the
man
did
as
joseph
bade
and
the
man
brought
the
men
into
joseph’s
house
43
18
and
the
men
were
afraid
because
they
were
brought
into
joseph’s
house
and
they
said
because
of
the
money
that
was
returned
in
our
sacks
at
the
first
time
are
we
brought
in
that
he
may
seek
occasion
against
us
and
fall
upon
us
and
take
us
for
bondmen
and
our
asses
43
19
and
they
came
near
to
the
steward
of
joseph’s
house
and
they
communed
with
him
at
the
door
of
the
house
43
20
and
said
o
sir
we
came
indeed
down
at
the
first
time
to
buy
food
43
21
and
it
came
to
pass
when
we
came
to
the
inn
that
we
opened
our
sacks
and
behold
every
man’s
money
was
in
the
mouth
of
his
sack
our
money
in
full
weight
and
we
have
brought
it
again
in
our
hand
43
22
and
other
money
have
we
brought
down
in
our
hands
to
buy
food
we
cannot
tell
who
put
our
money
in
our
sacks
43
23
and
he
said
peace
be
to
you
fear
not
your
god
and
the
god
of
your
father
hath
given
you
treasure
in
your
sacks
i
had
your
money
and
he
brought
simeon
out
unto
them
43
24
and
the
man
brought
the
men
into
joseph’s
house
and
gave
them
water
and
they
washed
their
feet
and
he
gave
their
asses
provender
43
25
and
they
made
ready
the
present
against
joseph
came
at
noon
for
they
heard
that
they
should
eat
bread
there
43
26
and
when
joseph
came
home
they
brought
him
the
present
which
was
in
their
hand
into
the
house
and
bowed
themselves
to
him
to
the
earth
43
27
and
he
asked
them
of
their
welfare
and
said
is
your
father
well
the
old
man
of
whom
ye
spake
is
he
yet
alive
43
28
and
they
answered
thy
servant
our
father
is
in
good
health
he
is
yet
alive
and
they
bowed
down
their
heads
and
made
obeisance
43
29
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
his
brother
benjamin
his
mother’s
son
and
said
is
this
your
younger
brother
of
whom
ye
spake
unto
me
and
he
said
god
be
gracious
unto
thee
my
son
43
30
and
joseph
made
haste
for
his
bowels
did
yearn
upon
his
brother
and
he
sought
where
to
weep
and
he
entered
into
his
chamber
and
wept
there
43
31
and
he
washed
his
face
and
went
out
and
refrained
himself
and
said
set
on
bread
43
32
and
they
set
on
for
him
by
himself
and
for
them
by
themselves
and
for
the
egyptians
which
did
eat
with
him
by
themselves
because
the
egyptians
might
not
eat
bread
with
the
hebrews
for
that
is
an
abomination
unto
the
egyptians
43
33
and
they
sat
before
him
the
firstborn
according
to
his
birthright
and
the
youngest
according
to
his
youth
and
the
men
marvelled
one
at
another
43
34
and
he
took
and
sent
messes
unto
them
from
before
him
but
benjamin’s
mess
was
five
times
so
much
as
any
of
theirs
and
they
drank
and
were
merry
with
him
44
1
and
he
commanded
the
steward
of
his
house
saying
fill
the
men’s
sacks
with
food
as
much
as
they
can
carry
and
put
every
man’s
money
in
his
sack’s
mouth
44
2
and
put
my
cup
the
silver
cup
in
the
sack’s
mouth
of
the
youngest
and
his
corn
money
and
he
did
according
to
the
word
that
joseph
had
spoken
44
3
as
soon
as
the
morning
was
light
the
men
were
sent
away
they
and
their
asses
44
4
and
when
they
were
gone
out
of
the
city
and
not
yet
far
off
joseph
said
unto
his
steward
up
follow
after
the
men
and
when
thou
dost
overtake
them
say
unto
them
wherefore
have
ye
rewarded
evil
for
good
44
5
is
not
this
it
in
which
my
lord
drinketh
and
whereby
indeed
he
divineth
ye
have
done
evil
in
so
doing
44
6
and
he
overtook
them
and
he
spake
unto
them
these
same
words
44
7
and
they
said
unto
him
wherefore
saith
my
lord
these
words
god
forbid
that
thy
servants
should
do
according
to
this
thing
44
8
behold
the
money
which
we
found
in
our
sacks’
mouths
we
brought
again
unto
thee
out
of
the
land
of
canaan
how
then
should
we
steal
out
of
thy
lord’s
house
silver
or
gold
44
9
with
whomsoever
of
thy
servants
it
be
found
both
let
him
die
and
we
also
will
be
my
lord’s
bondmen
44
10
and
he
said
now
also
let
it
be
according
unto
your
words
he
with
whom
it
is
found
shall
be
my
servant
and
ye
shall
be
blameless
44
11
then
they
speedily
took
down
every
man
his
sack
to
the
ground
and
opened
every
man
his
sack
44
12
and
he
searched
and
began
at
the
eldest
and
left
at
the
youngest
and
the
cup
was
found
in
benjamin’s
sack
44
13
then
they
rent
their
clothes
and
laded
every
man
his
ass
and
returned
to
the
city
44
14
and
judah
and
his
brethren
came
to
joseph’s
house
for
he
was
yet
there
and
they
fell
before
him
on
the
ground
44
15
and
joseph
said
unto
them
what
deed
is
this
that
ye
have
done
wot
ye
not
that
such
a
man
as
i
can
certainly
divine
44
16
and
judah
said
what
shall
we
say
unto
my
lord
what
shall
we
speak
or
how
shall
we
clear
ourselves
god
hath
found
out
the
iniquity
of
thy
servants
behold
we
are
my
lord’s
servants
both
we
and
he
also
with
whom
the
cup
is
found
44
17
and
he
said
god
forbid
that
i
should
do
so
but
the
man
in
whose
hand
the
cup
is
found
he
shall
be
my
servant
and
as
for
you
get
you
up
in
peace
unto
your
father
44
18
then
judah
came
near
unto
him
and
said
oh
my
lord
let
thy
servant
i
pray
thee
speak
a
word
in
my
lord’s
ears
and
let
not
thine
anger
burn
against
thy
servant
for
thou
art
even
as
pharaoh
44
19
my
lord
asked
his
servants
saying
have
ye
a
father
or
a
brother
44
20
and
we
said
unto
my
lord
we
have
a
father
an
old
man
and
a
child
of
his
old
age
a
little
one
and
his
brother
is
dead
and
he
alone
is
left
of
his
mother
and
his
father
loveth
him
44
21
and
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants
bring
him
down
unto
me
that
i
may
set
mine
eyes
upon
him
44
22
and
we
said
unto
my
lord
the
lad
cannot
leave
his
father
for
if
he
should
leave
his
father
his
father
would
die
44
23
and
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants
except
your
youngest
brother
come
down
with
you
ye
shall
see
my
face
no
more
44
24
and
it
came
to
pass
when
we
came
up
unto
thy
servant
my
father
we
told
him
the
words
of
my
lord
44
25
and
our
father
said
go
again
and
buy
us
a
little
food
44
26
and
we
said
we
cannot
go
down
if
our
youngest
brother
be
with
us
then
will
we
go
down
for
we
may
not
see
the
man’s
face
except
our
youngest
brother
be
with
us
44
27
and
thy
servant
my
father
said
unto
us
ye
know
that
my
wife
bare
me
two
sons
44
28
and
the
one
went
out
from
me
and
i
said
surely
he
is
torn
in
pieces
and
i
saw
him
not
since
44
29
and
if
ye
take
this
also
from
me
and
mischief
befall
him
ye
shall
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
44
30
now
therefore
when
i
come
to
thy
servant
my
father
and
the
lad
be
not
with
us
seeing
that
his
life
is
bound
up
in
the
lad’s
life
44
31
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
he
seeth
that
the
lad
is
not
with
us
that
he
will
die
and
thy
servants
shall
bring
down
the
gray
hairs
of
thy
servant
our
father
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
44
32
for
thy
servant
became
surety
for
the
lad
unto
my
father
saying
if
i
bring
him
not
unto
thee
then
i
shall
bear
the
blame
to
my
father
for
ever
44
33
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
let
thy
servant
abide
instead
of
the
lad
a
bondman
to
my
lord
and
let
the
lad
go
up
with
his
brethren
44
34
for
how
shall
i
go
up
to
my
father
and
the
lad
be
not
with
me
lest
peradventure
i
see
the
evil
that
shall
come
on
my
father
45
1
then
joseph
could
not
refrain
himself
before
all
them
that
stood
by
him
and
he
cried
cause
every
man
to
go
out
from
me
and
there
stood
no
man
with
him
while
joseph
made
himself
known
unto
his
brethren
45
2
and
he
wept
aloud
and
the
egyptians
and
the
house
of
pharaoh
heard
45
3
and
joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
i
am
joseph
doth
my
father
yet
live
and
his
brethren
could
not
answer
him
for
they
were
troubled
at
his
presence
45
4
and
joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
come
near
to
me
i
pray
you
and
they
came
near
and
he
said
i
am
joseph
your
brother
whom
ye
sold
into
egypt
45
5
now
therefore
be
not
grieved
nor
angry
with
yourselves
that
ye
sold
me
hither
for
god
did
send
me
before
you
to
preserve
life
45
6
for
these
two
years
hath
the
famine
been
in
the
land
and
yet
there
are
five
years
in
the
which
there
shall
neither
be
earing
nor
harvest
45
7
and
god
sent
me
before
you
to
preserve
you
a
posterity
in
the
earth
and
to
save
your
lives
by
a
great
deliverance
45
8
so
now
it
was
not
you
that
sent
me
hither
but
god
and
he
hath
made
me
a
father
to
pharaoh
and
lord
of
all
his
house
and
a
ruler
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
45
9
haste
ye
and
go
up
to
my
father
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
thy
son
joseph
god
hath
made
me
lord
of
all
egypt
come
down
unto
me
tarry
not
45
10
and
thou
shalt
dwell
in
the
land
of
goshen
and
thou
shalt
be
near
unto
me
thou
and
thy
children
and
thy
children’s
children
and
thy
flocks
and
thy
herds
and
all
that
thou
hast
45
11
and
there
will
i
nourish
thee
for
yet
there
are
five
years
of
famine
lest
thou
and
thy
household
and
all
that
thou
hast
come
to
poverty
45
12
and
behold
your
eyes
see
and
the
eyes
of
my
brother
benjamin
that
it
is
my
mouth
that
speaketh
unto
you
45
13
and
ye
shall
tell
my
father
of
all
my
glory
in
egypt
and
of
all
that
ye
have
seen
and
ye
shall
haste
and
bring
down
my
father
hither
45
14
and
he
fell
upon
his
brother
benjamin’s
neck
and
wept
and
benjamin
wept
upon
his
neck
45
15
moreover
he
kissed
all
his
brethren
and
wept
upon
them
and
after
that
his
brethren
talked
with
him
45
16
and
the
fame
thereof
was
heard
in
pharaoh’s
house
saying
joseph’s
brethren
are
come
and
it
pleased
pharaoh
well
and
his
servants
45
17
and
pharaoh
said
unto
joseph
say
unto
thy
brethren
this
do
ye
lade
your
beasts
and
go
get
you
unto
the
land
of
canaan
45
18
and
take
your
father
and
your
households
and
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
the
good
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
ye
shall
eat
the
fat
of
the
land
45
19
now
thou
art
commanded
this
do
ye
take
you
wagons
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
for
your
little
ones
and
for
your
wives
and
bring
your
father
and
come
45
20
also
regard
not
your
stuff
for
the
good
of
all
the
land
of
egypt
is
yours
45
21
and
the
children
of
israel
did
so
and
joseph
gave
them
wagons
according
to
the
commandment
of
pharaoh
and
gave
them
provision
for
the
way
45
22
to
all
of
them
he
gave
each
man
changes
of
raiment
but
to
benjamin
he
gave
three
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
five
changes
of
raiment
45
23
and
to
his
father
he
sent
after
this
manner
ten
asses
laden
with
the
good
things
of
egypt
and
ten
she
asses
laden
with
corn
and
bread
and
meat
for
his
father
by
the
way
45
24
so
he
sent
his
brethren
away
and
they
departed
and
he
said
unto
them
see
that
ye
fall
not
out
by
the
way
45
25
and
they
went
up
out
of
egypt
and
came
into
the
land
of
canaan
unto
jacob
their
father
45
26
and
told
him
saying
joseph
is
yet
alive
and
he
is
governor
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
and
jacob’s
heart
fainted
for
he
believed
them
not
45
27
and
they
told
him
all
the
words
of
joseph
which
he
had
said
unto
them
and
when
he
saw
the
wagons
which
joseph
had
sent
to
carry
him
the
spirit
of
jacob
their
father
revived
45
28
and
israel
said
it
is
enough
joseph
my
son
is
yet
alive
i
will
go
and
see
him
before
i
die
46
1
and
israel
took
his
journey
with
all
that
he
had
and
came
to
beersheba
and
offered
sacrifices
unto
the
god
of
his
father
isaac
46
2
and
god
spake
unto
israel
in
the
visions
of
the
night
and
said
jacob
jacob
and
he
said
here

i
46
3
and
he
said
i
am
god
the
god
of
thy

not
to
go
down
into
egypt
for
i
will
there
make
of

a

nation
46
4
i
will
go
down
with
thee
into

and
i
will
also
surely
bring
thee
up
again
and
joseph
shall
put
his
hand
upon
thine
eyes
46
5
and

rose
up
from

and
the

all
the

besides
jacob’s

wives
all
the

souls
all
the
souls
of
the
house
of

and
he
sent
judah
before
him
unto
joseph
to
direct
his
face
unto
goshen
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
goshen
46
29
and
joseph
made
ready
his
chariot
and
went
up
to
meet
israel
his
father
to
goshen
and
presented
himself
unto
him
and
he
fell
on
his
neck
and
wept
on
his
neck
a
good
while
46
30
and
israel
said
unto
joseph
now
let
me
die
since
i
have
seen
thy
face
because
thou
art
yet
alive
46
31
and
joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
and
unto
his
father’s
house
i
will
go
up
and
shew
pharaoh
and
say
unto
him
my
brethren
and
my
father’s
house
which
were
in
the
land
of
canaan
are
come
unto
me
46
32
and
the
men
are
shepherds
for
their
trade
hath
been
to
feed
cattle
and
they
have
brought
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
that
they
have
46
33
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
pharaoh
shall
call
you
and
shall
say
what
is
your
occupation
46
34
that
ye
shall
say
thy
servants’
trade
hath
been
about
cattle
from
our
youth
even
until
now
both
we
and
also
our
fathers
that
ye
may
dwell
in
the
land
of
goshen
for
every
shepherd
is
an
abomination
unto
the
egyptians
47
1
then
joseph
came
and
told
pharaoh
and
said
my
father
and
my
brethren
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
that
they
have
are
come
out
of
the
land
of
canaan
and
behold
they
are
in
the
land
of
goshen
47
2
and
he
took
some
of
his
brethren
even
five
men
and
presented
them
unto
pharaoh
47
3
and
pharaoh
said
unto
his
brethren
what
is
your
occupation
and
they
said
unto
pharaoh
thy
servants
are
shepherds
both
we
and
also
our
fathers
47
4
they
said
morever
unto
pharaoh
for
to
sojourn
in
the
land
are
we
come
for
thy
servants
have
no
pasture
for
their
flocks
for
the
famine
is
sore
in
the
land
of
canaan
now
therefore
we
pray
thee
let
thy
servants
dwell
in
the
land
of
goshen
47
5
and
pharaoh
spake
unto
joseph
saying
thy

and
thy

the

and
if
thou
knowest
any
men
of
activity
among
them
then
make
them
rulers
over
my
cattle
47
7
and
joseph
brought
in
jacob
his
father
and
set
him
before
pharaoh
and
jacob
blessed
pharaoh
47
8
and
pharaoh
said
unto
jacob
how
old
art
thou
47
9
and
jacob
said
unto
pharaoh
the
days
of
the
years
of
my
pilgrimage
are
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
few
and
evil
have
the
days
of
the
years
of
my
life
been
and
have
not
attained
unto
the
days
of
the
years
of
the
life
of
my
fathers
in
the
days
of
their
pilgrimage
47
10
and
jacob
blessed
pharaoh
and
went
out
from
before
pharaoh
47
11
and
joseph
placed
his
father
and
his
brethren
and
gave
them
a
possession
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
best
of
the
land
in
the
land
of
rameses
as
pharaoh
had
commanded
47
12
and
joseph
nourished
his
father
and
his
brethren
and
all
his
father’s
household
with
bread
according
to
their
families
47
13
and
there
was
no
bread
in
all
the
land
for
the
famine
was
very
sore
so
that
the
land
of
egypt
and
all
the
land
of
canaan
fainted
by
reason
of
the
famine
47
14
and
joseph
gathered
up
all
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
in
the
land
of
canaan
for
the
corn
which
they
bought
and
joseph
brought
the
money
into
pharaoh’s
house
47
15
and
when
money
failed
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
in
the
land
of
canaan
all
the
egyptians
came
unto
joseph
and
said
give
us
bread
for
why
should
we
die
in
thy
presence
for
the
money
faileth
47
16
and
joseph
said
give
your
cattle
and
i
will
give
you
for
your
cattle
if
money
fail
47
17
and
they
brought
their
cattle
unto
joseph
and
joseph
gave
them
bread
in
exchange
for
horses
and
for
the
flocks
and
for
the
cattle
of
the
herds
and
for
the
asses
and
he
fed
them
with
bread
for
all
their
cattle
for
that
year
47
18
when
that
year
was
ended
they
came
unto
him
the
second
year
and
said
unto
him
we
will
not
hide
it
from
my
lord
how
that
our
money
is
spent
my
lord
also
hath
our
herds
of
cattle
there
is
not
ought
left
in
the
sight
of
my
lord
but
our
bodies
and
our
lands
47
19
wherefore
shall
we
die
before
thine
eyes
both
we
and
our
land
buy
us
and
our
land
for
bread
and
we
and
our
land
will
be
servants
unto
pharaoh
and
give
us
seed
that
we
may
live
and
not
die
that
the
land
be
not
desolate
47
20
and
joseph
bought
all
the
land
of
egypt
for
pharaoh
for
the
egyptians
sold
every
man
his
field
because
the
famine
prevailed
over
them
so
the
land
became
pharaoh’s
47
21
and
as
for
the
people
he
removed
them
to
cities
from
one
end
of
the
borders
of
egypt
even
to
the
other
end
thereof
47
22
only
the
land
of
the
priests
bought
he
not
for
the
priests
had
a
portion
assigned
them
of
pharaoh
and
did
eat
their
portion
which
pharaoh
gave
them
wherefore
they
sold
not
their
lands
47
23
then
joseph
said
unto
the
people
behold
i
have
bought
you
this
day
and
your
land
for
pharaoh
lo
here
is
seed
for
you
and
ye
shall
sow
the
land
47
24
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
increase
that
ye
shall
give
the
fifth
part
unto
pharaoh
and
four
parts
shall
be
your
own
for
seed
of
the
field
and
for
your
food
and
for
them
of
your
households
and
for
food
for
your
little
ones
47
25
and
they
said
thou
hast
saved
our
lives
let
us
find
grace
in
the
sight
of
my
lord
and
we
will
be
pharaoh’s
servants
47
26
and
joseph
made
it
a
law
over
the
land
of
egypt
unto
this
day
that
pharaoh
should
have
the
fifth
part
except
the
land
of
the
priests
only
which
became
not
pharaoh’s
47
27
and
israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
country
of
goshen
and
they
had
possessions
therein
and
grew
and
multiplied
exceedingly
47
28
and
jacob
lived
in
the
land
of
egypt
seventeen
years
so
the
whole
age
of
jacob
was
an
hundred
forty
and
seven
years
47
29
and
the
time
drew
nigh
that
israel
must
die
and
he
called
his
son
joseph
and
said
unto
him
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
put
i
pray
thee
thy
hand
under
my
thigh
and
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
me
bury
me
not
i
pray
thee
in
egypt
47
30
but
i
will
lie
with
my
fathers
and
thou
shalt
carry
me
out
of
egypt
and
bury
me
in
their
buryingplace
and
he
said
i
will
do
as
thou
hast
said
47
31
and
he
said
swear
unto
me
and
he
sware
unto
him
and
israel
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed’s
head
48
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
one
told
joseph
behold
thy
father
is
sick
and
he
took
with
him
his
two
sons
manasseh
and
ephraim
48
2
and
one
told
jacob
and
said
behold
thy
son
joseph
cometh
unto
thee
and
israel
strengthened
himself
and
sat
upon
the
bed
48
3
and
jacob
said
unto
joseph
god
almighty
appeared
unto
me
at
luz
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
blessed
me
48
4
and
said
unto
me
behold
i
will
make
thee
fruitful
and
multiply
thee
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
multitude
of
people
and
will
give
this
land
to
thy
seed
after
thee
for
an
everlasting
possession
48
5
and
now
thy
two
sons
ephraim
and
manasseh
which
were
born
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
egypt
before
i
came
unto
thee
into
egypt
are
mine
as
reuben
and
simeon
they
shall
be
mine
48
6
and
thy
issue
which
thou
begettest
after
them
shall
be
thine
and
shall
be
called
after
the
name
of
their
brethren
in
their
inheritance
48
7
and
as
for
me
when
i
came
from
padan
rachel
died
by
me
in
the
land
of
canaan
in
the
way
when
yet
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
unto
ephrath
and
i
buried
her
there
in
the
way
of
ephrath
the
same
is
bethlehem
48
8
and
israel
beheld
joseph’s
sons
and
said
who
are
these
48
9
and
joseph
said
unto
his
father
they
are
my
sons
whom
god
hath
given
me
in
this
place
and
he
said
bring
them
i
pray
thee
unto
me
and
i
will
bless
them
48
10
now
the
eyes
of
israel
were
dim
for
age
so
that
he
could
not
see
and
he
brought
them
near
unto
him
and
he
kissed
them
and
embraced
them
48
11
and
israel
said
unto
joseph
i
had
not
thought
to
see
thy
face
and
lo
god
hath
shewed
me
also
thy
seed
48
12
and
joseph
brought
them
out
from
between
his
knees
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
to
the
earth
48
13
and
joseph
took
them
both
ephraim
in
his
right
hand
toward
israel’s
left
hand
and
manasseh
in
his
left
hand
toward
israel’s
right
hand
and
brought
them
near
unto
him
48
14
and
israel
stretched
out
his
right
hand
and
laid
it
upon
ephraim’s
head
who
was
the
younger
and
his
left
hand
upon
manasseh’s
head
guiding
his
hands
wittingly
for
manasseh
was
the
firstborn
48
15
and
he
blessed
joseph
and
said
god
before
whom
my
fathers
abraham
and
isaac
did
walk
the
god
which
fed
me
all
my
life
long
unto
this
day
48
16
the
angel
which
redeemed
me
from
all
evil
bless
the
lads
and
let
my
name
be
named
on
them
and
the
name
of
my
fathers
abraham
and
isaac
and
let
them
grow
into
a
multitude
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
48
17
and
when
joseph
saw
that
his
father
laid
his
right
hand
upon
the
head
of
ephraim
it
displeased
him
and
he
held
up
his
father’s
hand
to
remove
it
from
ephraim’s
head
unto
manasseh’s
head
48
18
and
joseph
said
unto
his
father
not
so
my
father
for
this
is
the
firstborn
put
thy
right
hand
upon
his
head
48
19
and
his
father
refused
and
said
i
know
it
my
son
i
know
it
he
also
shall
become
a
people
and
he
also
shall
be
great
but
truly
his
younger
brother
shall
be
greater
than
he
and
his
seed
shall
become
a
multitude
of
nations
48
20
and
he
blessed
them
that
day
saying
in
thee
shall
israel
bless
saying
god
make
thee
as
ephraim
and
as
manasseh
and
he
set
ephraim
before
manasseh
48
21
and
israel
said
unto
joseph
behold
i
die
but
god
shall
be
with
you
and
bring
you
again
unto
the
land
of
your
fathers
48
22
moreover
i
have
given
to
thee
one
portion
above
thy
brethren
which
i
took
out
of
the
hand
of
the
amorite
with
my
sword
and
with
my
bow
49
1
and
jacob
called
unto
his
sons
and
said
gather
yourselves
together
that
i
may
tell
you
that
which
shall
befall
you
in
the
last
days
49

that
lieth
under
blessings
of
the
breasts
and
of
the
womb
49
26
the
blessings
of
thy
father
have
prevailed
above
the
blessings
of
my
progenitors
unto
the
utmost
bound
of
the
everlasting
hills
they
shall
be
on
the
head
of
joseph
and
on
the
crown
of
the
head
of
him
that
was
separate
from
his
brethren
49
27
benjamin
shall
ravin
as
a
wolf
in
the
morning
he
shall
devour
the
prey
and
at
night
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
49
28
all
these
are
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
and
this
is
it
that
their
father
spake
unto
them
and
blessed
them
every
one
according
to
his
blessing
he
blessed
them
49
29
and
he
charged
them
and
said
unto
them
i
am
to
be
gathered
unto
my
people
bury
me
with
my
fathers
in
the
cave
that
is
in
the
field
of
ephron
the
hittite
49
30
in
the
cave
that
is
in
the
field
of
machpelah
which
is
before
mamre
in
the
land
of
canaan
which
abraham
bought
with
the
field
of
ephron
the
hittite
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
49
31
there
they
buried
abraham
and
sarah
his
wife
there
they
buried
isaac
and
rebekah
his
wife
and
there
i
buried
leah
49
32
the
purchase
of
the
field
and
of
the
cave
that
is
therein
was
from
the
children
of
heth
49
33
and
when
jacob
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
sons
he
gathered
up
his
feet
into
the
bed
and
yielded
up
the
ghost
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people
50
1
and
joseph
fell
upon
his
father’s
face
and
wept
upon
him
and
kissed
him
50
2
and
joseph
commanded
his
servants
the
physicians
to
embalm
his
father
and
the
physicians
embalmed
israel
50
3
and
forty
days
were
fulfilled
for
him
for
so
are
fulfilled
the
days
of
those
which
are
embalmed
and
the
egyptians
mourned
for
him
threescore
and
ten
days
50
4
and
when
the
days
of
his
mourning
were
past
joseph
spake
unto
the
house
of
pharaoh
saying
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
your
eyes
speak
i
pray
you
in
the
ears
of
pharaoh
saying
50
5
my
father
made
me
swear
saying
lo
i
die
in
my
grave
which
i
have
digged
for
me
in
the
land
of
canaan
there
shalt
thou
bury
me
now
therefore
let
me
go
up
i
pray
thee
and
bury
my
father
and
i
will
come
again
50
6
and
pharaoh
said
go
up
and
bury
thy
father
according
as
he
made
thee
swear
50
7
and
joseph
went
up
to
bury
his
father
and
with
him
went
up
all
the
servants
of
pharaoh
the
elders
of
his
house
and
all
the
elders
of
the
land
of
egypt
50
8
and
all
the
house
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
his
father’s
house
only
their
little
ones
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
they
left
in
the
land
of
goshen
50
9
and
there
went
up
with
him
both
chariots
and
horsemen
and
it
was
a
very
great
company
50
10
and
they
came
to
the
threshingfloor
of
atad
which
is
beyond
jordan
and
there
they
mourned
with
a
great
and
very
sore
lamentation
and
he
made
a
mourning
for
his
father
seven
days
50
11
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
the
canaanites
saw
the
mourning
in
the
floor
of
atad
they
said
this
is
a
grievous
mourning
to
the
egyptians
wherefore
the
name
of
it
was
called
abelmizraim
which
is
beyond
jordan
50
12
and
his
sons
did
unto
him
according
as
he
commanded
them
50
13
for
his
sons
carried
him
into
the
land
of
canaan
and
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
machpelah
which
abraham
bought
with
the
field
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
of
ephron
the
hittite
before
mamre
50
14
and
joseph
returned
into
egypt
he
and
his
brethren
and
all
that
went
up
with
him
to
bury
his
father
after
he
had
buried
his
father
50
15
and
when
joseph’s
brethren
saw
that
their
father
was
dead
they
said
joseph
will
peradventure
hate
us
and
will
certainly
requite
us
all
the
evil
which
we
did
unto
him
50
16
and
they
sent
a
messenger
unto
joseph
saying
thy
father
did
command
before
he
died
saying
50
17
so
shall
ye
say
unto
joseph
forgive
i
pray
thee
now
the
trespass
of
thy
brethren
and
their
sin
for
they
did
unto
thee
evil
and
now
we
pray
thee
forgive
the
trespass
of
the
servants
of
the
god
of
thy
father
and
joseph
wept
when
they
spake
unto
him
50
18
and
his
brethren
also
went
and
fell
down
before
his
face
and
they
said
behold
we
be
thy
servants
50
19
and
joseph
said
unto
them
fear
not
for
am
i
in
the
place
of
god
50
20
but
as
for
you
ye
thought
evil
against
me
but
god
meant
it
unto
good
to
bring
to
pass
as
it
is
this
day
to
save
much
people
alive
50
21
now
therefore
fear
ye
not
i
will
nourish
you
and
your
little
ones
and
he
comforted
them
and
spake
kindly
unto
them
50
22
and
joseph
dwelt
in
egypt
he
and
his
father’s
house
and
joseph
lived
an
hundred
and
ten
years
50
23
and
joseph
saw
ephraim’s
children
of
the
third
generation
the
children
also
of
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
were
brought
up
upon
joseph’s
knees
50
24
and
joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
i
die
and
god
will
surely
visit
you
and
bring
you
out
of
this
land
unto
the
land
which
he
sware
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
50
25
and
joseph
took
an
oath
of
the
children
of
israel
saying
god
will
surely
visit
you
and
ye
shall
carry
up
my
bones
from
hence
50
26
so
joseph
died
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old
and
they
embalmed
him
and
he
was
put
in
a
coffin
in
egypt
the
second
book
of
moses
called
exodus
1
1
now
these
are
the
names
of
the
children
of
israel
which
came
into
egypt
every
man
and
his
household
came
with
jacob
1
2
reuben
simeon
levi
and
judah
1
3
issachar
zebulun
and
benjamin
1
4
dan
and
naphtali
gad
and
asher
1
5
and
all
the
souls
that
came
out
of
the
loins
of
jacob
were
seventy
souls
for
joseph
was
in
egypt
already
1
6
and
joseph
died
and
all
his
brethren
and
all
that
generation
1
7
and
the
children
of
israel
were
fruitful
and
increased
abundantly
and
multiplied
and
waxed
exceeding
mighty
and
the
land
was
filled
with
them
1
8
now
there
arose
up
a
new
king
over
egypt
which
knew
not
joseph
1
9
and
he
said
unto
his
people
behold
the
people
of
the
children
of
israel
are
more
and
mightier
than
we
1
10
come
on
let
us
deal
wisely
with
them
lest
they
multiply
and
it
come
to
pass
that
when
there
falleth
out
any
war
they
join
also
unto
our
enemies
and
fight
against
us
and
so
get
them
up
out
of
the
land
1
11
therefore
they
did
set
over
them
taskmasters
to
afflict
them
with
their
burdens
and
they
built
for
pharaoh
treasure
cities
pithom
and
raamses
1
12
but
the
more
they
afflicted
them
the
more
they
multiplied
and
grew
and
they
were
grieved
because
of
the
children
of
israel
1
13
and
the
egyptians
made
the
children
of
israel
to
serve
with
rigour
1
14
and
they
made
their
lives
bitter
with
hard
bondage
in
morter
and
in
brick
and
in
all
manner
of
service
in
the
field
all
their
service
wherein
they
made
them
serve
was
with
rigour
1
15
and
the
king
of
egypt
spake
to
the
hebrew
midwives
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
shiphrah
and
the
name
of
the
other
puah
1
16
and
he
said
when
ye
do
the
office
of
a
midwife
to
the
hebrew
women
and
see
them
upon
the
stools
if
it
be
a
son
then
ye
shall
kill
him
but
if
it
be
a
daughter
then
she
shall
live
1
17
but
the
midwives
feared
god
and
did
not
as
the
king
of
egypt
commanded
them
but
saved
the
men
children
alive
1
18
and
the
king
of
egypt
called
for
the
midwives
and
said
unto
them
why
have
ye
done
this
thing
and
have
saved
the
men
children
alive
1
19
and
the
midwives
said
unto
pharaoh
because
the
hebrew
women
are
not
as
the
egyptian
women
for
they
are
lively
and
are
delivered
ere
the
midwives
come
in
unto
them
1
20
therefore
god
dealt
well
with
the
midwives
and
the
people
multiplied
and
waxed
very
mighty
1
21
and
it
came
to
pass
because
the
midwives
feared
god
that
he
made
them
houses
1
22
and
pharaoh
charged
all
his
people
saying
every
son
that
is
born
ye
shall
cast
into
the
river
and
every
daughter
ye
shall
save
alive
2
1
and
there
went
a
man
of
the
house
of
levi
and
took
to
wife
a
daughter
of
levi
2
2
and
the
woman
conceived
and
bare
a
son
and
when
she
saw
him
that
he
was
a
goodly
child
she
hid
him
three
months
2
3
and
when
she
could
not
longer
hide
him
she
took
for
him
an
ark
of
bulrushes
and
daubed
it
with
slime
and
with
pitch
and
put
the
child
therein
and
she
laid
it
in
the
flags
by
the
river’s
brink
2
4
and
his
sister
stood
afar
off
to
wit
what
would
be
done
to
him
2
5
and
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
came
down
to
wash
herself
at
the
river
and
her
maidens
walked
along
by
the
river’s
side
and
when
she
saw
the
ark
among
the
flags
she
sent
her
maid
to
fetch
it
2
6
and
when
she
had
opened
it
she
saw
the
child
and
behold
the
babe
wept
and
she
had
compassion
on
him
and
said
this
is
one
of
the
hebrews’
children
2
7
then
said
his
sister
to
pharaoh’s
daughter
shall
i
go
and
call
to
thee
a
nurse
of
the
hebrew
women
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
thee
2
8
and
pharaoh’s
daughter
said
to
her
go
and
the
maid
went
and
called
the
child’s
mother
2
9
and
pharaoh’s
daughter
said
unto
her
take
this
child
away
and
nurse
it
for
me
and
i
will
give
thee
thy
wages
and
the
woman
took
the
child
and
nursed
it
2
10
and
the
child
grew
and
she
brought
him
unto
pharaoh’s
daughter
and
he
became
her
son
and
she
called
his
name
moses
and
she
said
because
i
drew
him
out
of
the
water
2
11
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
when
moses
was
grown
that
he
went
out
unto
his
brethren
and
looked
on
their
burdens
and
he
spied
an
egyptian
smiting
an
hebrew
one
of
his
brethren
2
12
and
he
looked
this
way
and
that
way
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
no
man
he
slew
the
egyptian
and
hid
him
in
the
sand
2
13
and
when
he
went
out
the
second
day
behold
two
men
of
the
hebrews
strove
together
and
he
said
to
him
that
did
the
wrong
wherefore
smitest
thou
thy
fellow
2
14
and
he
said
who
made
thee
a
prince
and
a
judge
over
us
intendest
thou
to
kill
me
as
thou
killedst
the
egyptian
and
moses
feared
and
said
surely
this
thing
is
known
2
15
now
when
pharaoh
heard
this
thing
he
sought
to
slay
moses
but
moses
fled
from
the
face
of
pharaoh
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
midian
and
he
sat
down
by
a
well
2
16
now
the
priest
of
midian
had
seven
daughters
and
they
came
and
drew
water
and
filled
the
troughs
to
water
their
father’s
flock
2
17
and
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
away
but
moses
stood
up
and
helped
them
and
watered
their
flock
2
18
and
when
they
came
to
reuel
their
father
he
said
how
is
it
that
ye
are
come
so
soon
to
day
2
19
and
they
said
an
egyptian
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
shepherds
and
also
drew
water
enough
for
us
and
watered
the
flock
2
20
and
he
said
unto
his
daughters
and
where
is
he
why
is
it
that
ye
have
left
the
man
call
him
that
he
may
eat
bread
2
21
and
moses
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
man
and
he
gave
moses
zipporah
his
daughter
2
22
and
she
bare
him
a
son
and
he
called
his
name
gershom
for
he
said
i
have
been
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
2
23
and
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
time
that
the
king
of
egypt
died
and
the
children
of
israel
sighed
by
reason
of
the
bondage
and
they
cried
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
god
by
reason
of
the
bondage
2
24
and
god
heard
their
groaning
and
god
remembered
his
covenant
with
abraham
with
isaac
and
with
jacob
2
25
and
god
looked
upon
the
children
of
israel
and
god
had
respect
unto
them
3
1
now
moses
kept
the
flock
of
jethro
his
father
in
law
the
priest
of
midian
and
he
led
the
flock
to
the
backside
of
the
desert
and
came
to
the
mountain
of
god
even
to
horeb
3
2
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
the
midst
of
a
bush
and
he
looked
and
behold
the
bush
burned
with
fire
and
the
bush
was
not
consumed
3
3
and
moses
said
i
will
now
turn
aside
and
see
this
great
sight
why
the
bush
is
not
burnt
3
4
and
when
the
lord
saw
that
he
turned
aside
to
see
god
called
unto
him
out
of
the
midst
of
the
bush
and
said
moses
moses
and
he
said
here
am
i
3
5
and
he
said
draw
not
nigh
hither
put
off
thy
shoes
from
off
thy
feet
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
ground
3
6
moreover
he
said
i
am
the
god
of
thy
father
the
god
of
abraham
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
moses
hid
his
face
for
he
was
afraid
to
look
upon
god
3
7
and
the
lord
said
i
have
surely
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
are
in
egypt
and
have
heard
their
cry
by
reason
of
their
taskmasters
for
i
know
their
sorrows
3
8
and
i
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
to
bring
them
up
out
of
that
land
unto
a
good
land
and
a
large
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
unto
the
place
of
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
3
9
now
therefore
behold
the
cry
of
the
children
of
israel
is
come
unto
me
and
i
have
also
seen
the
oppression
wherewith
the
egyptians
oppress
them
3
10
come
now
therefore
and
i
will
send
thee
unto
pharaoh
that
thou
mayest
bring
forth
my
people
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
3
11
and
moses
said
unto
god
who

unto
pharaoh
and
that
i
should
bring
forth
the
children
of

out
of
egypt
3
12
and
he
said
certainly
i
will
be
with
thee
and
this
shall
be
a
token
unto
thee
that
i
have
sent
thee
when
thou
hast
brought
forth
the
people
out
of
egypt
ye
shall
serve
god
upon
this
mountain
3
13
and
moses
said
unto
god
behold
when
i
come
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
shall
say
unto
them
the
god
of
your
fathers
hath
sent
me
unto
you
and
they
shall
say
to
me
what
is
his
name
what
shall
i
say
unto
them
3
14
and
god
said
unto
moses
i
am
that
i
am
and
he
said
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
the
children
of
israel
i
am
hath
sent
me
unto
you
3
15
and
god
said
moreover
unto
moses
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
the
children
of
israel
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
hath
sent
me
unto
you
this
is
my
name
for
ever
and
this
is
my
memorial
unto
all
generations
3
16
go
and
gather
the
elders
of
israel
together
and
say
unto
them
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
appeared
unto
me
saying
i
have
surely
visited
you
and
seen
that
which
is
done
to
you
in
egypt
3
17
and
i
have
said
i
will
bring
you
up
out
of
the
affliction
of
egypt
unto
the
land
of
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
3
18
and
they
shall
hearken
to
thy
voice
and
thou
shalt
come
thou
and
the
elders
of
israel
unto
the
king
of
egypt
and
ye
shall
say
unto
him
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
hath
met
with
us
and
now
let
us
go
we
beseech
thee
three
days’
journey
into
the
wilderness
that
we
may
sacrifice
to
the
lord
our
god
3
19
and
i
am
sure
that
the
king
of
egypt
will
not
let
you
go
no
not
by
a
mighty
hand
3
20
and
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
and
smite
egypt
with
all
my
wonders
which
i
will
do
in
the
midst
thereof
and
after
that
he
will
let
you
go
3
21
and
i
will
give
this
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
egyptians
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
ye
go
ye
shall
not
go
empty
3
22
but
every
woman
shall
borrow
of
her
neighbour
and
of
her
that
sojourneth
in
her
house
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold
and
raiment
and
ye
shall
put
them
upon
your
sons
and
upon
your
daughters
and
ye
shall
spoil
the
egyptians
4
1
and
moses
answered
and
said
but
behold
they
will
not
believe
me
nor
hearken
unto
my
voice
for
they
will
say
the
lord
hath
not
appeared
unto
thee
4
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
what
is
that
in
thine
hand
and
he
said
a
rod
4
3
and
he
said
cast
it
on
the
ground
and
he
cast
it
on
the
ground
and
it
became
a
serpent
and
moses
fled
from
before
it
4
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
put
forth
thine
hand
and
take
it
by
the
tail
and
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
caught
it
and
it
became
a
rod
in
his
hand
4
5
that
they
may
believe
that
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
hath
appeared
unto
thee
4
6
and
the
lord
said
furthermore
unto
him
put
now
thine
hand
into
thy
bosom
and
he
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
when
he
took
it
out
behold
his
hand
was
leprous
as
snow
4
7
and
he
said
put
thine
hand
into
thy
bosom
again
and
he
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
again
and
plucked
it
out
of
his
bosom
and
behold
it
was
turned
again
as
his
other
flesh
4
8
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
not
believe
thee
neither
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
first
sign
that
they
will
believe
the
voice
of
the
latter
sign
4
9
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
not
believe
also
these
two
signs
neither
hearken
unto
thy
voice
that
thou
shalt
take
of
the
water
of
the
river
and
pour
it
upon
the
dry
land
and
the
water
which
thou
takest
out
of
the
river
shall
become
blood
upon
the
dry
land
4
10
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
o
my
lord
i
am
not
eloquent
neither
heretofore
nor
since
thou
hast
spoken
unto
thy
servant
but
i
am
slow
of
speech
and
of
a
slow
tongue
4
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
who
hath
made
man’s
mouth
or
who
maketh
the
dumb
or
deaf
or
the
seeing
or
the
blind
have
not
i
the
lord
4
12
now
therefore
go
and
i
will
be
with
thy
mouth
and
teach
thee
what
thou
shalt
say
4
13
and
he
said
o
my
lord
send
i
pray
thee
by
the
hand
of
him
whom
thou
wilt
send
4
14
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
moses
and
he
said
is
not
aaron
the
levite
thy
brother
i
know
that
he
can
speak
well
and
also
behold
he
cometh
forth
to
meet
thee
and
when
he
seeth
thee
he
will
be
glad
in
his
heart
4
15
and
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
and
put
words
in
his
mouth
and
i
will
be
with
thy
mouth
and
with
his
mouth
and
will
teach
you
what
ye
shall
do
4
16
and
he
shall
be
thy
spokesman
unto
the
people
and
he
shall
be
even
he
shall
be
to
thee
instead
of
a
mouth
and
thou
shalt
be
to
him
instead
of
god
4
17
and
thou
shalt
take
this
rod
in
thine
hand
wherewith
thou
shalt
do
signs
4
18
and
moses
went
and
returned
to
jethro
his
father
in
law
and
said
unto
him
let
me
go
i
pray
thee
and
return
unto
my
brethren
which
are
in
egypt
and
see
whether
they
be
yet
alive
and
jethro
said
to
moses
go
in
peace
4
19
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
in
midian
go
return
into
egypt
for
all
the
men
are
dead
which
sought
thy
life
4
20
and
moses
took
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
set
them
upon
an
ass
and
he
returned
to
the
land
of
egypt
and
moses
took
the
rod
of
god
in
his
hand
4
21
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
when
thou
goest
to
return
into
egypt
see
that
thou
do
all
those
wonders
before
pharaoh
which
i
have
put
in
thine
hand
but
i
will
harden
his
heart
that
he
shall
not
let
the
people
go
4
22
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
pharaoh
thus
saith
the
lord
israel
is
my
son
even
my
firstborn
4
23
and
i
say
unto
thee
let
my
son
go
that
he
may
serve
me
and
if
thou
refuse
to
let
him
go
behold
i
will
slay
thy
son
even
thy
firstborn
4
24
and
it
came
to
pass
by
the
way
in
the
inn
that
the
lord
met
him
and
sought
to
kill
him
4
25
then
zipporah
took
a
sharp
stone
and
cut
off
the
foreskin
of
her
son
and
cast
it
at
his
feet
and
said
surely
a
bloody
husband
art
thou
to
me
4
26
so
he
let
him
go
then
she
said
a
bloody
husband
thou
art
because
of
the
circumcision
4
27
and
the
lord
said
to
aaron
go
into
the
wilderness
to
meet
moses
and
he
went
and
met
him
in
the
mount
of
god
and
kissed
him
4
28
and
moses
told
aaron
all
the
words
of
the
lord
who
had
sent
him
and
all
the
signs
which
he
had
commanded
him
4
29
and
moses
and
aaron
went
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
the
children
of
israel
4
30
and
aaron
spake
all
the
words
which
the
lord
had
spoken
unto
moses
and
did
the
signs
in
the
sight
of
the
people
4
31
and
the
people
believed
and
when
they
heard
that
the
lord
had
visited
the
children
of
israel
and
that
he
had
looked
upon
their
affliction
then
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
5
1
and
afterward
moses
and
aaron
went
in
and
told
pharaoh
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
hold
a
feast
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
5
2
and
pharaoh
said
who
is
the
lord
that
i
should
obey
his
voice
to
let
israel
go
i
know
not
the
lord
neither
will
i
let
israel
go
5
3
and
they
said
the
god
of
the
hebrews
hath
met
with
us
let
us
go
we
pray
thee
three
days’
journey
into
the
desert
and
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
our
god
lest
he
fall
upon
us
with
pestilence
or
with
the
sword
5
4
and
the
king
of
egypt
said
unto
them
wherefore
do
ye
moses
and
aaron
let
the
people
from
their
works
get
you
unto
your
burdens
5
5
and
pharaoh
said
behold
the
people
of
the
land
now
are
many
and
ye
make
them
rest
from
their
burdens
5
6
and
pharaoh
commanded
the
same
day
the
taskmasters
of
the
people
and
their
officers
saying
5
7
ye
shall
no
more
give
the
people
straw
to
make
brick
as
heretofore
let
them
go
and
gather
straw
for
themselves
5
8
and
the
tale
of
the
bricks
which
they
did
make
heretofore
ye
shall
lay
upon
them
ye
shall
not
diminish
ought
thereof
for
they
be
idle
therefore
they
cry
saying
let
us
go
and
sacrifice
to
our
god
5
9
let
there
more
work
be
laid
upon
the
men
that
they
may
labour
therein
and
let
them
not
regard
vain
words
5
10
and
the
taskmasters
of
the
people
went
out
and
their
officers
and
they
spake
to
the
people
saying
thus
saith
pharaoh
i
will
not
give
you
straw
5
11
go
ye
get
you
straw
where
ye
can
find
it
yet
not
ought
of
your
work
shall
be
diminished
5
12
so
the
people
were
scattered
abroad
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
to
gather
stubble
instead
of
straw
5
13
and
the
taskmasters
hasted
them
saying
fulfil
your
works
your
daily
tasks
as
when
there
was
straw
5
14
and
the
officers
of
the
children
of
israel
which
pharaoh’s
taskmasters
had
set
over
them
were
beaten
and
demanded
wherefore
have
ye
not
fulfilled
your
task
in
making
brick
both
yesterday
and
to
day
as
heretofore
5
15
then
the
officers
of
the
children
of
israel
came
and
cried
unto
pharaoh
saying
wherefore
dealest
thou
thus
with
thy
servants
5
16
there
is
no
straw
given
unto
thy
servants
and
they
say
to
us
make
brick
and
behold
thy
servants
are
beaten
but
the
fault
is
in
thine
own
people
5
17
but
he
said
ye
are
idle
ye
are
idle
therefore
ye
say
let
us
go
and
do
sacrifice
to
the
lord
5
18
go
therefore
now
and
work
for
there
shall
no
straw
be
given
you
yet
shall
ye
deliver
the
tale
of
bricks
5
19
and
the
officers
of
the
children
of
israel
did
see
that
they
were
in
evil
case
after
it
was
said
ye
shall
not
minish
ought
from
your
bricks
of
your
daily
task
5
20
and
they
met
moses
and
aaron
who
stood
in
the
way
as
they
came
forth
from
pharaoh
5
21
and
they
said
unto
them
the
lord
look
upon
you
and
judge
because
ye
have
made
our
savour
to
be
abhorred
in
the
eyes
of
pharaoh
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
servants
to
put
a
sword
in
their
hand
to
slay
us
5
22
and
moses
returned
unto
the
lord
and
said
lord
wherefore
hast
thou
so
evil
entreated
this
people
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
me
5
23
for
since
i
came
to
pharaoh
to
speak
in
thy
name
he
hath
done
evil
to
this
people
neither
hast
thou
delivered
thy
people
at
all
6
1
then
the
lord
said
unto
moses
now
shalt
thou
see
what
i
will
do
to
pharaoh
for
with
a
strong
hand
shall
he
let
them
go
and
with
a
strong
hand
shall
he
drive
them
out
of
his
land
6
2
and
god
spake
unto
moses
and
said
unto
him
i
am
the
lord
6
3
and
i
appeared
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
by
the
name
of
god
almighty
but
by
my
name
jehovah
was
i
not
known
to
them
6
4
and
i
have
also
established
my
covenant
with
them
to
give
them
the
land
of
canaan
the
land
of
their
pilgrimage
wherein
they
were
strangers
6
5
and
i
have
also
heard
the
groaning
of
the
children
of
israel
whom
the
egyptians
keep
in
bondage
and
i
have
remembered
my
covenant
6
6
wherefore
say
unto
the
children
of
israel
i
am
the
lord
and
i
will
bring
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
the
egyptians
and
i
will
rid
you
out
of
their
bondage
and
i
will
redeem
you
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
great
judgments
6
7
and
i
will
take
you
to
me
for
a
people
and
i
will
be
to
you
a
god
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
which
bringeth
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
the
egyptians
6
8
and
i
will
bring
you
in
unto
the
land
concerning
the
which
i
did
swear
to
give
it
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
and
i
will
give
it
you
for
an
heritage
i
am
the
lord
6
9
and
moses
spake
so
unto
the
children
of
israel
but
they
hearkened
not
unto
moses
for
anguish
of
spirit
and
for
cruel
bondage
6
10
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
6
11
go
in
speak
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
that
he
let
the
children
of
israel
go
out
of
his
land
6
12
and
moses
spake
before
the
lord
saying
behold
the
children
of
israel
have
not
hearkened
unto
me
how
then
shall
pharaoh
hear
me
who
am
of
uncircumcised
lips
6
13
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
and
gave
them
a
charge
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
to
bring
the
children
of
israel

of
the
land
of

and
i
will
harden

heart
and
multiply
my
signs
and
my
wonders
in
the
land
of

7

but
pharaoh
shall
not
hearken
unto
you
that
i
may
lay
my
hand
upon

and
bring
forth
mine
armies
and
my
people
the
children
of
israel
out
of

judgments

am

lord
when
i
stretch
forth

hand
upon

and
bring
out
the

and

so
did
they
7
7
and

was
fourscore
years
old
and

fourscore
and
three
years
old
when
they
spake
unto

7
8

and
unto

saying
7
9
when

shall
speak
unto
you
saying
shew
a
miracle
for
you
then
thou
shalt
say
unto

take

it
before

and
it
shall
become
a
serpent
7
10
and

and
aaron
went
in
unto
pharaoh
and
they
did
so
as
the
lord
had
commanded
and
aaron
cast
down
his
rod
before
pharaoh
and
before
his
servants
and
it
became
a
serpent
7
11
then
pharaoh
also
called
the
wise
men
and
the
sorcerers
now
the
magicians
of
egypt
they
also
did
in
like
manner
with
their
enchantments
7
12
for
they
cast
down
every
man
his
rod
and
they
became
serpents
but
aaron’s
rod
swallowed
up
their
rods
7
13
and
he
hardened
pharaoh’s
heart
that
he
hearkened
not
unto
them
as
the
lord
had
said
7
14
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
pharaoh’s
heart
is
hardened
he
refuseth
to
let
the
people
go
7
15
get
thee
unto
pharaoh
in
the
morning
lo
he
goeth
out
unto
the
water
and
thou
shalt
stand
by
the
river’s
brink
against
he
come
and
the
rod
which
was
turned
to
a
serpent
shalt
thou
take
in
thine
hand
7
16
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
him
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
hath
sent
me
unto
thee
saying
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
in
the
wilderness
and
behold
hitherto
thou
wouldest
not
hear
7
17
thus
saith
the
lord
in
this
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
behold
i
will
smite
with
the
rod
that
is
in
mine
hand
upon
the
waters
which
are
in
the
river
and
they
shall
be
turned
to
blood
7
18
and
the
fish
that
is
in
the
river
shall
die
and
the
river
shall
stink
and
the
egyptians
shall
lothe
to
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river
7
19
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
say
unto
aaron
take
thy
rod
and
stretch
out
thine
hand
upon
the
waters
of
egypt
upon
their
streams
upon
their
rivers
and
upon
their
ponds
and
upon
all
their
pools
of
water
that
they
may
become
blood
and
that
there
may
be
blood
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
both
in
vessels
of
wood
and
in
vessels
of
stone
7
20
and
moses
and
aaron
did
so
as
the
lord
commanded
and
he
lifted
up
the
rod
and
smote
the
waters
that
were
in
the
river
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
and
in
the
sight
of
his
servants
and
all
the
waters
that
were
in
the
river
were
turned
to
blood
7
21
and
the
fish
that
was
in
the
river
died
and
the
river
stank
and
the
egyptians
could
not
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river
and
there
was
blood
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
7
22
and
the
magicians
of
egypt
did
so
with
their
enchantments
and
pharaoh’s
heart
was
hardened
neither
did
he
hearken
unto
them
as
the
lord
had
said
7
23
and
pharaoh
turned
and
went
into
his
house
neither
did
he
set
his
heart
to
this
also
7
24
and
all
the
egyptians
digged
round
about
the
river
for
water
to
drink
for
they
could
not
drink
of
the
water
of
the
river
7
25
and
seven
days
were
fulfilled
after
that
the
lord
had
smitten
the
river
8
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
go
unto
pharaoh
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
8
2
and
if
thou
refuse
to
let
them
go
behold
i
will
smite
all
thy
borders
with
frogs
8
3
and
the
river
shall
bring
forth
frogs
abundantly
which
shall
go
up
and
come
into
thine
house
and
into
thy
bedchamber
and
upon
thy
bed
and
into
the
house
of
thy
servants
and
upon
thy
people
and
into
thine
ovens
and
into
thy
kneadingtroughs
8
4
and
the
frogs
shall
come
up
both
on
thee
and
upon
thy
people
and
upon
all
thy
servants
8
5
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
say
unto
aaron
stretch
forth
thine
hand
with
thy
rod
over
the
streams
over
the
rivers
and
over
the
ponds
and
cause
frogs
to
come
up
upon
the
land
of
egypt
8
6
and
aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
waters
of
egypt
and
the
frogs
came
up
and
covered
the
land
of
egypt
8
7
and
the
magicians
did
so
with
their
enchantments
and
brought
up
frogs
upon
the
land
of
egypt
8
8
then
pharaoh
called
for
moses
and
aaron
and
said
intreat
the
lord
that
he
may
take
away
the
frogs
from
me
and
from
my
people
and
i
will
let
the
people
go
that
they
may
do
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
8
9
and
moses
said
unto
pharaoh
glory
over
me
when
shall
i
intreat
for
thee
and
for
thy
servants
and
for
thy
people
to
destroy
the
frogs
from
thee
and
thy
houses
that
they
may
remain
in
the
river
only
8
10
and
he
said
to
morrow
and
he
said
be
it
according
to
thy
word
that
thou
mayest
know
that
there
is
none
like
unto
the
lord
our
god
8
11
and
the
frogs
shall
depart
from
thee
and
from
thy
houses
and
from
thy
servants
and
from
thy
people
they
shall
remain
in
the
river
only
8
12
and
moses
and
aaron
went
out
from
pharaoh
and
moses
cried
unto
the
lord
because
of
the
frogs
which
he
had
brought
against
pharaoh
8
13
and
the
lord
did
according
to
the
word
of
moses
and
the
frogs
died
out
of
the
houses
out
of
the
villages
and
out
of
the
fields
8
14
and
they
gathered
them
together
upon
heaps
and
the
land
stank
8
15
but
when
pharaoh
saw
that
there
was
respite
he
hardened
his
heart
and
hearkened
not
unto
them
as
the
lord
had
said
8
16
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
say
unto
aaron
stretch
out
thy
rod
and
smite
the
dust
of
the
land
that
it
may
become
lice
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
8
17
and
they
did
so
for
aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
with
his
rod
and
smote
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
it
became
lice
in
man
and
in
beast
all
the
dust
of
the
land
became
lice
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
8
18
and
the
magicians
did
so
with
their
enchantments
to
bring
forth
lice
but
they
could
not
so
there
were
lice
upon
man
and
upon
beast
8
19
then
the
magicians
said
unto
pharaoh
this
is
the
finger
of
god
and
pharaoh’s
heart
was
hardened
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them
as
the
lord
had
said
8
20
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
and
stand
before
pharaoh
lo
he
cometh
forth
to
the
water
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
8
21
else
if
thou
wilt
not
let
my
people
go
behold
i
will
send
swarms
of
flies
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
servants
and
upon
thy
people
and
into
thy
houses
and
the
houses
of
the
egyptians
shall
be
full
of
swarms
of
flies
and
also
the
ground
whereon
they
are
8
22
and
i
will
sever
in
that
day
the
land
of
goshen
in
which
my
people
dwell
that
no
swarms
of
flies
shall
be
there
to
the
end
thou
mayest
know
that
i
am
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
8
23
and
i
will
put
a
division
between
my
people
and
thy
people
to
morrow
shall
this
sign
be
8
24
and
the
lord
did
so
and
there
came
a
grievous
swarm
of
flies
into
the
house
of
pharaoh
and
into
his
servants’
houses
and
into
all
the
land
of
egypt
the
land
was
corrupted
by
reason
of
the
swarm
of
flies
8
25
and
pharaoh
called
for
moses
and
for
aaron
and
said
go
ye
sacrifice
to
your
god
in
the
land
8
26
and
moses
said
it
is
not
meet
so
to
do
for
we
shall
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
egyptians
to
the
lord
our
god
lo
shall
we
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
egyptians
before
their
eyes
and
will
they
not
stone
us
8
27
we
will
go
three
days’
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
sacrifice
to
the
lord
our
god
as
he
shall
command
us
8
28
and
pharaoh
said
i
will
let
you
go
that
ye
may
sacrifice
to
the
lord
your
god
in
the
wilderness
only
ye
shall
not
go
very
far
away
intreat
for
me
8
29
and
moses
said
behold
i
go
out
from
thee
and
i
will
intreat
the
lord
that
the
swarms
of
flies
may
depart
from
pharaoh
from
his
servants
and
from
his
people
to
morrow
but
let
not
pharaoh
deal
deceitfully
any
more
in
not
letting
the
people
go
to
sacrifice
to
the
lord
8
30
and
moses
went
out
from
pharaoh
and
intreated
the
lord
8
31
and
the
lord
did
according
to
the
word
of
moses
and
he
removed
the
swarms
of
flies
from
pharaoh
from
his
servants
and
from
his
people
there
remained
not
one
8
32
and
pharaoh
hardened
his
heart
at
this
time
also
neither
would
he
let
the
people
go
9
1
then
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
in
unto
pharaoh
and
tell
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
9
2
for
if
thou
refuse
to
let
them
go
and
wilt
hold
them
still
9
3
behold
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
upon
thy
cattle
which
is
in
the
field
upon
the
horses
upon
the
asses
upon
the
camels
upon
the
oxen
and
upon
the
sheep
there
shall
be
a
very
grievous
murrain
9
4
and
the
lord
shall
sever
between
the
cattle
of
israel
and
the
cattle
of
egypt
and
there
shall
nothing
die
of
all
that
is
the
children’s
of
israel
9
5
and
the
lord
appointed
a
set
time
saying
to
morrow
the
lord
shall
do
this
thing
in
the
land
9
6
and
the
lord
did
that
thing
on
the
morrow
and
all
the
cattle
of
egypt
died
but
of
the
cattle
of
the
children
of
israel
died
not
one
9
7
and
pharaoh
sent
and
behold
there
was
not
one
of
the
cattle
of
the
israelites
dead
and
the
heart
of
pharaoh
was
hardened
and
he
did
not
let
the
people
go
9
8
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
take
to
you
handfuls
of
ashes
of
the
furnace
and
let
moses
sprinkle
it
toward
the
heaven
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
9
9
and
it
shall
become
small
dust
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
and
shall
be
a
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man
and
upon
beast
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
9
10
and
they
took
ashes
of
the
furnace
and
stood
before
pharaoh
and
moses
sprinkled
it
up
toward
heaven
and
it
became
a
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man
and
upon
beast
9
11
and
the
magicians
could
not
stand
before
moses
because
of
the
boils
for
the
boil
was
upon
the
magicians
and
upon
all
the
egyptians
9
12
and
the
lord
hardened
the
heart
of
pharaoh
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them
as
the
lord
had
spoken
unto
moses
9
13
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
and
stand
before
pharaoh
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
9
14
for
i
will
at
this
time
send
all
my
plagues
upon
thine
heart
and
upon
thy
servants
and
upon
thy
people
that
thou
mayest
know
that
there
is
none
like
me
in
all
the
earth
9
15
for
now
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
that
i
may
smite
thee
and
thy
people
with
pestilence
and
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
from
the
earth
9
16
and
in
very
deed
for
this
cause
have
i
raised
thee
up
for
to
shew
in
thee
my
power
and
that
my
name
may
be
declared
throughout
all
the
earth
9
17
as
yet
exaltest
thou
thyself
against
my
people
that
thou
wilt
not
let
them
go
9
18
behold
to
morrow
about
this
time
i
will
cause
it
to
rain
a
very
grievous
hail
such
as
hath
not
been
in
egypt
since
the
foundation
thereof
even
until

send
therefore
now
and
gather
thy
cattle
and
all
that
thou
hast
in
the
field
for
upon
every
man
and
beast
which
shall
be
found
in
the
field
and
shall
not
be
brought
home
the
hail
shall
come
down
upon
them
and

he
that
feared
the
word
of
the
lord
among
the
servants
of
pharaoh
made
his
servants
and
his
cattle
flee
into
the
houses
9
21
and
he
that
regarded
not
the
word
of
the
lord
left
his
servants
and
his
cattle
in
the
field
9
22
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
stretch
forth
thine
hand
toward
heaven
that
there
may
be
hail
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
upon
man
and
upon
beast
and
upon
every
herb
of
the
field
throughout
the
land
of
egypt
9
23
and
moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
toward
heaven
and
the
lord
sent
thunder
and
hail
and
the
fire
ran
along
upon
the
ground
and
the
lord
rained
hail
upon
the
land
of
egypt
9
24
so
there
was
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
the
hail
very
grievous
such
as
there
was
none
like
it
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
since
it
became
a
nation
9
25
and
the
hail
smote
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
all
that
was
in
the
field
both
man
and
beast
and
the
hail
smote
every
herb
of
the
field
and
brake
every
tree
of
the
field
9
26
only
in
the
land
of
goshen
where
the
children
of
israel
were
was
there
no
hail
9
27
and
pharaoh
sent
and
called
for
moses
and
aaron
and
said
unto
them
i
have
sinned
this
time
the
lord
is
righteous
and
i
and
my
people
are
wicked
9
28
intreat
the
lord
(for
it
is
enough)
that
there
be
no
more
mighty
thunderings
and
hail
and
i
will
let
you
go
and
ye
shall
stay
no
longer
9
29
and
moses
said
unto
him
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
out
of
the
city
i
will
spread
abroad
my
hands
unto
the
lord
and
the
thunder
shall
cease
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
hail
that
thou
mayest
know
how
that
the
earth
is
the
lord’s
9
30
but
as
for
thee
and
thy
servants
i
know
that
ye
will
not
yet
fear
the
lord
god
9
31
and
the
flax
and
the
barley
was
smitten
for
the
barley
was
in
the
ear
and
the
flax
was
bolled
9
32
but
the
wheat
and
the
rie
were
not
smitten
for
they
were
not
grown
up
9
33
and
moses
went
out
of
the
city
from
pharaoh
and
spread
abroad
his
hands
unto
the
lord
and
the
thunders
and
hail
ceased
and
the
rain
was
not
poured
upon
the
earth
9
34
and
when
pharaoh
saw
that
the
rain
and
the
hail
and
the
thunders
were
ceased
he
sinned
yet
more
and
hardened
his
heart
he
and
his
servants
9
35
and
the
heart
of
pharaoh
was
hardened
neither
would
he
let
the
children
of
israel
go
as
the
lord
had
spoken
by
moses
10
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
in
unto
pharaoh
for
i
have
hardened
his
heart
and
the
heart
of
his
servants
that
i
might
shew
these
my
signs
before
him
10
2
and
that
thou
mayest
tell
in
the
ears
of
thy
son
and
of
thy
son’s
son
what
things
i
have
wrought
in
egypt
and
my
signs
which
i
have
done
among
them
that
ye
may
know
how
that
i
am
the
lord
10
3
and
moses
and
aaron
came
in
unto
pharaoh
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
how
long
wilt
thou
refuse
to
humble
thyself
before
me
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
10
4
else
if
thou
refuse
to
let
my
people
go
behold
to
morrow
will
i
bring
the
locusts
into
thy
coast
10
5
and
they
shall
cover
the
face
of
the
earth
that
one
cannot
be
able
to
see
the
earth
and
they
shall
eat
the
residue
of
that
which
is
escaped
which
remaineth
unto
you
from
the
hail
and
shall
eat
every
tree
which
groweth
for
you
out
of
the
field
10
6
and
they
shall
fill
thy
houses
and
the
houses
of
all
thy
servants
and
the
houses
of
all
the
egyptians
which
neither
thy
fathers
nor
thy
fathers’
fathers
have
seen
since
the
day
that
they
were
upon
the
earth
unto
this
day
and
he
turned
himself
and
went
out
from
pharaoh
10
7
and
pharaoh’s
servants
said
unto
him
how
long
shall
this
man
be
a
snare
unto
us
let
the
men
go
that
they
may
serve
the
lord
their
god
knowest
thou
not
yet
that
egypt
is
destroyed
10
8
and
moses
and
aaron
were
brought
again
unto
pharaoh
and
he
said
unto
them
go
serve
the
lord
your
god
but
who
are
they
that
shall
go
10
9
and
moses
said
we
will
go
with
our
young
and
with
our
old
with
our
sons
and
with
our
daughters
with
our
flocks
and
with
our
herds
will
we
go
for
we
must
hold
a
feast
unto
the
lord
10
10
and
he
said
unto
them
let
the
lord
be
so
with
you
as
i
will
let
you
go
and
your
little
ones
look
to
it
for
evil
is
before
you
10
11
not
so
go
now
ye
that
are
men
and
serve
the
lord
for
that
ye
did
desire
and
they
were
driven
out
from
pharaoh’s
presence
10
12
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
land
of
egypt
for
the
locusts
that
they
may
come
up
upon
the
land
of
egypt
and
eat
every
herb
of
the
land
even
all
that
the
hail
hath
left
10
13
and
moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
over
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
lord
brought
an
east
wind
upon
the
land
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
and
when
it
was
morning
the
east
wind
brought
the
locusts
10
14
and
the
locust
went
up
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
and
rested
in
all
the
coasts
of
egypt
very
grievous
were
they
before
them
there
were
no
such
locusts
as
they
neither
after
them
shall
be
such
10
15
for
they
covered
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
so
that
the
land
was
darkened
and
they
did
eat
every
herb
of
the
land
and
all
the
fruit
of
the
trees
which
the
hail
had
left
and
there
remained
not
any
green
thing
in
the
trees
or
in
the
herbs
of
the
field
through
all
the
land
of
egypt
10
16
then
pharaoh
called
for
moses
and
aaron
in
haste
and
he
said
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
your
god
and
against
you
10
17
now
therefore
forgive
i
pray
thee
my
sin
only
this
once
and
intreat
the
lord
your
god
that
he
may
take
away
from
me
this
death
only
10
18
and
he
went
out
from
pharaoh
and
intreated
the
lord
10
19
and
the
lord
turned
a
mighty
strong
west
wind
which
took
away
the
locusts
and
cast
them
into
the
red
sea
there
remained
not
one
locust
in
all
the
coasts
of
egypt
10
20
but
the
lord
hardened
pharaoh’s
heart
so
that
he
would
not
let
the
children
of
israel
go
10
21
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
stretch
out
thine
hand
toward
heaven
that
there
may
be
darkness
over
the
land
of
egypt
even
darkness
which
may
be
felt
10
22
and
moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
heaven
and
there
was
a
thick
darkness
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
three
days
10
23
they
saw
not
one
another
neither
rose
any
from
his
place
for
three
days
but
all
the
children
of
israel
had
light
in
their
dwellings
10
24
and
pharaoh
called
unto
moses
and
said
go
ye
serve
the
lord
only
let
your
flocks
and
your
herds
be
stayed
let
your
little
ones
also
go
with
you
10
25
and
moses
said
thou
must
give
us
also
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
that
we
may
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
our
god
10
26
our
cattle
also
shall
go
with
us
there
shall
not
an
hoof
be
left
behind
for
thereof
must
we
take
to
serve
the
lord
our
god
and
we
know
not
with
what
we
must
serve
the
lord
until
we
come
thither
10
27
but
the
lord
hardened
pharaoh’s
heart
and
he
would
not
let
them
go
10
28
and
pharaoh
said
unto
him
get
thee
from
me
take
heed
to
thyself
see
my
face
no
more
for
in
that
day
thou
seest
my
face
thou
shalt
die
10
29
and
moses
said
thou
hast
spoken
well
i
will
see
thy
face
again
no
more
11
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
yet
will
i
bring
one
plague
more
upon
pharaoh
and
upon
egypt
afterwards
he
will
let
you
go
hence
when
he
shall
let
you
go
he
shall
surely
thrust
you
out
hence
altogether
11
2
speak
now
in
the
ears
of
the
people
and
let
every
man
borrow
of
his
neighbour
and
every
woman
of
her
neighbour
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold
11
3
and
the
lord
gave
the
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
egyptians
moreover
the
man
moses
was
very
great
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh’s
servants
and
in
the
sight
of
the
people
11
4
and
moses
said
thus
saith
the
lord
about
midnight
will
i
go
out
into
the
midst
of
egypt
11
5
and
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
egypt
shall
die
from
the
first
born
of
pharaoh
that
sitteth
upon
his
throne
even
unto
the
firstborn
of
the
maidservant
that
is
behind
the
mill
and
all
the
firstborn
of
beasts
11
6
and
there
shall
be
a
great
cry
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
such
as
there
was
none
like
it
nor
shall
be
like
it
any
more
11
7
but
against
any
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
not
a
dog
move
his
tongue
against
man
or
beast
that
ye
may
know
how
that
the
lord
doth
put
a
difference
between
the
egyptians
and
israel
11
8
and
all
these
thy
servants
shall
come
down
unto
me
and
bow
down
themselves
unto
me
saying
get
thee
out
and
all
the
people
that
follow
thee
and
after
that
i
will
go
out
and
he
went
out
from
pharaoh
in
a
great
anger
11
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
pharaoh
shall
not
hearken
unto
you
that
my
wonders
may
be
multiplied
in
the
land
of
egypt
11
10
and
moses
and
aaron
did
all
these
wonders
before
pharaoh
and
the
lord
hardened
pharaoh’s
heart
so
that
he
would
not
let
the
children
of
israel
go
out
of
his
land
12
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
in
the
land
of
egypt
saying
12
2
this
month
shall
be
unto
you
the
beginning
of
months
it
shall
be
the
first
month
of
the
year

you
12
3
speak
ye
unto
all
the

of
israel
saying
in

tenth
day
of

month
they
shall
take
to
them
every
man
a
lamb
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
a
lamb
for
an
house
12
4
and
if
the
household
be
too
little
for
the
lamb
let
him
and
his
neighbour
next
unto
his
house
take
it
according
to
the
number
of
the
souls
every
man
according
to
his
eating
shall
make
your
count
for
the
lamb
12
5
your
lamb
shall
be
without
blemish
a
male
of
the
first
year
ye
shall
take
it
out
from
the
sheep
or
from
the
goats
12
6
and
ye
shall
keep
it
up
until
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
month
and
the
whole
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
israel
shall
kill
it
in
the
evening
12
7
and
they
shall
take
of

and
strike
it
on
the
two
side
posts
and
on
the
upper
door
post
of
the
houses
wherein
they
shall
eat
it
12
8
and
they
shall
eat
the

head
with
his
legs
and
with
the
purtenance
thereof
12
10
and
ye
shall
let

remain
until
the
morning
and
that
which
remaineth
of
it
until
the
morning
ye
shall

with

12
11
and
thus

ye
eat
it
with

loins
girded
your
shoes
on
your
feet
and
your
staff
in

and
ye

he
seeth
the
blood
upon
the
lintel
and
on
the
two
side
posts
the
lord
will
pass
over
the
door
and
will
not
suffer
the
destroyer
to
come
in
unto
your
houses
to
smite
you
12
24
and
ye
shall
observe
this
thing
for
an
ordinance
to
thee
and
to
thy
sons
for
ever
12
25
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
ye
be
come
to
the
land
which
the
lord
will
give
you
according
as
he
hath
promised
that
ye
shall
keep
this
service
12
26
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
your
children
shall
say
unto
you
what
mean
ye
by
this
service
12
27
that
ye
shall
say
it
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
lord’s
passover
who
passed
over
the
houses
of
the
children
of
israel
in
egypt
when
he
smote
the
egyptians
and
delivered
our
houses
and
the
people
bowed
the
head
and
worshipped
12
28
and
the
children
of
israel
went
away
and
did
as
the
lord
had
commanded
moses
and
aaron
so
did
they
12
29
and
it
came
to
pass
that
at
midnight
the
lord
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
firstborn
of
pharaoh
that
sat
on
his
throne
unto
the
firstborn
of
the
captive
that
was
in
the
dungeon
and
all
the
firstborn
of
cattle
12
30
and
pharaoh
rose
up
in
the
night
he
and
all
his
servants
and
all
the
egyptians
and
there
was
a
great
cry
in
egypt
for
there
was
not
a
house
where
there
was
not
one
dead
12
31
and
he
called
for
moses
and
aaron
by
night
and
said
rise
up
and
get
you
forth
from
among
my
people
both
ye
and
the
children
of
israel
and
go
serve
the
lord
as
ye
have
said
12
32
also
take
your
flocks
and
your
herds
as
ye
have
said
and
be
gone
and
bless
me
also
12
33
and
the
egyptians
were
urgent
upon
the
people
that
they
might
send
them
out
of
the
land
in
haste
for
they
said
we
be
all
dead
men
12
34
and
the
people
took
their
dough
before
it
was
leavened
their
kneadingtroughs
being
bound
up
in
their
clothes
upon
their
shoulders
12
35
and
the
children
of
israel
did
according
to
the
word
of
moses
and
they
borrowed
of
the
egyptians
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold
and
raiment
12
36
and
the
lord
gave
the
people
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
egyptians
so
that
they
lent
unto
them
such
things
as
they
required
and
they
spoiled
the
egyptians
12
37
and
the
children
of
israel
journeyed
from
rameses
to
succoth
about
six
hundred
thousand
on
foot
that
were
men
beside
children
12
38
and
a
mixed
multitude
went
up
also
with
them
and
flocks
and
herds
even
very
much
cattle
12
39
and
they
baked
unleavened
cakes
of
the
dough
which
they
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
for
it
was
not
leavened
because
they
were
thrust
out
of
egypt
and
could
not
tarry
neither
had
they
prepared
for
themselves
any
victual
12
40
now
the
sojourning
of
the
children
of
israel
who
dwelt
in
egypt
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
12
41
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
even
the
selfsame
day
it
came
to
pass
that
all
the
hosts
of
the
lord
went
out
from
the
land
of
egypt
12
42
it
is
a
night
to
be
much
observed
unto
the
lord
for
bringing
them
out
from
the
land
of
egypt
this
is
that
night
of
the
lord
to
be
observed
of
all
the
children
of
israel
in
their
generations
12
43
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
and
aaron
this
is
the
ordinance
of
the
passover
there
shall
no
stranger
eat
thereof
12
44
but
every
man’s
servant
that
is
bought
for
money
when
thou
hast
circumcised
him
then
shall
he
eat
thereof
12
45
a
foreigner
and
an
hired
servant
shall
not
eat
thereof
12
46
in
one
house
shall
it
be
eaten
thou
shalt
not
carry
forth
ought
of
the
flesh
abroad
out
of
the
house
neither
shall
ye
break
a
bone
thereof
12
47
all
the
congregation
of
israel
shall
keep
it
12
48
and
when
a
stranger
shall
sojourn
with
thee
and
will
keep
the
passover
to
the
lord
let
all
his
males
be
circumcised
and
then
let
him
come
near
and
keep
it
and
he
shall
be
as
one
that
is
born
in
the
land
for
no
uncircumcised
person
shall
eat
thereof
12
49
one
law
shall
be
to
him
that
is
homeborn
and
unto
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
you
12
50
thus
did
all
the
children
of
israel
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
aaron
so
did
they
12
51
and
it
came
to
pass
the
selfsame
day
that
the
lord
did
bring
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
by
their
armies
13
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
13
2
sanctify
unto
me
all
the
firstborn
whatsoever
openeth
the
womb
among
the
children
of
israel
both
of
man
and
of
beast
it
is
mine
13
3
and
moses
said
unto
the
people
remember
this
day
in
which
ye
came
out
from
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
for
by
strength
of
hand
the
lord
brought
you
out
from
this
place
there
shall
no
leavened
bread
be
eaten
13
4
this
day
came
ye
out
in
the
month
abib
13
5
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
of
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
that
thou
shalt
keep
this
service
in
this
month
13
6
seven
days
thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread
and
in
the
seventh
day
shall
be
a
feast
to
the
lord
13
7
unleavened
bread
shall
be
eaten
seven
days
and
there
shall
no
leavened
bread
be
seen
with
thee
neither
shall
there
be
leaven
seen
with
thee
in
all
thy
quarters
13
8
and
thou
shalt
shew
thy
son
in
that
day
saying
this
is
done
because
of
that
which
the
lord
did
unto
me
when
i
came
forth
out
of
egypt
13
9
and
it
shall
be
for
a
sign
unto
thee
upon
thine
hand
and
for
a
memorial
between
thine
eyes
that
the
lord’s
law
may
be
in
thy
mouth
for
with
a
strong
hand
hath
the
lord
brought
thee
out
of
egypt
13
10
thou
shalt
therefore
keep
this
ordinance
in
his
season
from
year
to
year
13
11
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
of
the
canaanites
as
he
sware
unto
thee
and
to
thy
fathers
and
shall
give
it
thee
13
12
that
thou
shalt
set
apart
unto
the
lord
all
that
openeth
the
matrix
and
every
firstling
that
cometh
of
a
beast
which
thou
hast
the
males
shall
be
the
lord’s
13
13
and
every
firstling
of
an
ass
thou
shalt
redeem
with
a
lamb
and
if
thou
wilt
not
redeem
it
then
thou
shalt
break
his
neck
and
all
the
firstborn
of
man
among
thy
children
shalt
thou
redeem
13
14
and
it
shall
be
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come
saying
what
is
this
that
thou
shalt
say
unto
him
by
strength
of
hand
the
lord
brought
us
out
from
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
13
15
and
it
came
to
pass
when
pharaoh
would
hardly
let
us
go
that
the
lord
slew
all
the
firstborn
in
the
land
of
egypt
both
the
firstborn
of
man
and
the
firstborn
of
beast
therefore
i
sacrifice
to
the
lord
all
that
openeth
the
matrix
being
males
but
all
the
firstborn
of
my
children
i
redeem
13
16
and
it
shall
be
for
a
token
upon
thine
hand
and
for
frontlets
between
thine
eyes
for
by
strength
of
hand
the
lord
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
13
17
and
it
came
to
pass
when
pharaoh
had
let
the
people
go
that
god
led
them
not
through
the
way
of
the
land
of
the
philistines
although
that
was
near
for
god
said
lest
peradventure
the
people
repent
when
they
see
war
and
they
return
to
egypt
13
18
but
god
led
the
people
about
through
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
the
red
sea
and
the
children
of
israel
went
up
harnessed
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
13
19
and
moses
took
the
bones
of
joseph
with
him
for
he
had
straitly
sworn
the
children
of
israel
saying
god
will
surely
visit
you
and
ye
shall
carry
up
my
bones
away
hence
with
you
13
20
and
they
took
their
journey
from
succoth
and
encamped
in
etham
in
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
13
21
and
the
lord
went
before
them
by
day
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud
to
lead
them
the
way
and
by
night
in
a
pillar
of
fire
to
give
them
light
to
go
by
day
and
night
13
22
he
took
not
away
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
by
day
nor
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
from
before
the
people
14
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
14
2
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
turn
and
encamp
before
pihahiroth
between
migdol
and
the
sea
over
against
baalzephon
before
it
shall
ye
encamp
by
the
sea
14
3
for
pharaoh
will
say
of
the
children
of
israel
they
are
entangled
in
the
land
the
wilderness
hath
shut
them
in
14
4
and
i
will
harden
pharaoh’s
heart
that
he
shall
follow
after
them
and
i
will
be
honoured
upon
pharaoh
and
upon
all
his
host
that
the
egyptians
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
they
did
so
14
5
and
it
was
told
the
king
of
egypt
that
the
people
fled
and
the
heart
of
pharaoh
and
of
his
servants
was
turned
against
the
people
and
they
said
why
have
we
done
this
that
we
have
let
israel
go
from
serving
us
14
6
and
he
made
ready
his
chariot
and
took
his
people
with
him
14
7
and
he
took
six
hundred
chosen
chariots
and
all
the
chariots
of
egypt
and
captains
over
every
one
of
them
14
8
and
the
lord
hardened
the
heart
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
he
pursued
after
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
went
out
with
an
high
hand
14
9
but
the
egyptians
pursued
after
them
all
the
horses
and
chariots
of
pharaoh
and
his
horsemen
and
his
army
and
overtook
them
encamping
by
the
sea
beside
pihahiroth
before
baalzephon
14
10
and
when
pharaoh
drew
nigh
the
children
of
israel
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
behold
the
egyptians
marched
after
them
and
they
were
sore
afraid
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
out
unto
the
lord
14
11
and
they
said
unto
moses
because
there
were
no
graves
in
egypt
hast
thou
taken
us
away
to
die
in
the
wilderness
wherefore
hast
thou
dealt
thus
with
us
to
carry
us
forth
out
of
egypt
14
12
is
not
this
the
word
that
we
did
tell
thee
in
egypt
saying
let
us
alone
that
we
may
serve
the
egyptians
for
it
had
been
better
for
us
to
serve
the
egyptians
than
that
we
should
die
in
the
wilderness
14
13
and
moses
said
unto
the
people
fear
ye
not
stand
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
which
he
will
shew
to
you
to
day
for
the
egyptians
whom
ye
have
seen
to
day
ye
shall
see
them
again
no
more
for
ever
14
14
the
lord
shall
fight
for
you
and
ye
shall
hold
your
peace
14
15
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
wherefore
criest
thou
unto
me
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
go
forward
14
16
but
lift
thou
up
thy
rod
and
stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
sea
and
divide
it
and
the
children
of
israel
shall
go
on
dry
ground
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
14
17
and
i
behold
i
will
harden
the
hearts
of
the
egyptians
and
they
shall
follow
them
and
i
will
get
me
honour
upon
pharaoh
and
upon
all
his
host
upon
his
chariots
and
upon
his
horsemen
14
18
and
the
egyptians
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
gotten
me
honour
upon
pharaoh
upon
his
chariots
and
upon
his
horsemen
14
19
and
the
angel
of
god
which
went
before
the
camp
of
israel
removed
and
went
behind
them
and
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
went
from
before
their
face
and
stood
behind
them
14
20
and
it
came
between
the
camp
of
the
egyptians
and
the
camp
of
israel
and
it
was
a
cloud
and
darkness
to
them
but
it
gave
light
by
night
to
these
so
that
the
one
came
not
near
the
other
all
the
night
14
21
and
moses
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea
and
the
lord
caused
the
sea
to
go
back
by
a
strong
east
wind
all
that
night
and
made
the
sea
dry
land
and
the
waters
were
divided
14
22
and
the
children
of
israel
went
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
upon
the
dry
ground
and
the
waters
were
a
wall
unto
them
on
their
right
hand
and
on
their
left
14
23
and
the
egyptians
pursued
and
went
in
after
them
to
the
midst
of
the
sea
even
all
pharaoh’s
horses
his
chariots
and
his
horsemen
14
24
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
morning
watch
the
lord
looked
unto
the
host
of
the
egyptians
through
the
pillar
of
fire
and
of
the
cloud
and
troubled
the
host
of
the
egyptians
14
25
and
took
off
their
chariot
wheels
that
they
drave
them
heavily
so
that
the
egyptians
said
let
us
flee
from
the
face
of
israel
for
the
lord
fighteth
for
them
against
the
egyptians
14
26
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
stretch
out
thine
hand
over
the
sea
that
the
waters
may
come
again
upon
the
egyptians
upon
their
chariots
and
upon
their
horsemen
14
27
and
moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
over
the
sea
and
the
sea
returned
to
his
strength
when
the
morning
appeared
and
the
egyptians
fled
against
it
and
the
lord
overthrew
the
egyptians
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
14
28
and
the
waters
returned
and
covered
the
chariots
and
the
horsemen
and
all
the
host
of
pharaoh
that
came
into
the
sea
after
them
there
remained
not
so
much
as
one
of
them
14
29
but
the
children
of
israel
walked
upon
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
the
waters
were
a
wall
unto
them
on
their
right
hand
and
on
their
left
14
30
thus
the
lord
saved
israel
that
day
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
israel
saw
the
egyptians
dead
upon
the
sea
shore
14
31
and
israel
saw
that
great
work
which
the
lord
did
upon
the
egyptians
and
the
people
feared
the
lord
and
believed
the
lord
and
his
servant
moses
15
1
then
sang
moses
and
the
children
of
israel
this
song
unto
the
lord
and
spake

thy
right

excellency
thou

overthrown
them
that
rose
up
against
thee
thou
sentest
forth
thy
wrath

and
with
the
blast
of
thy
nostrils
the
waters
were
gathered
together
the

thou

mighty
waters

in
praises
doing

thou
stretchedst
out

13
thou
in
thy
mercy

led
forth

thou
hast
guided
them
in

the
people
shall
hear
and
be

sorrow
shall
take
hold
on

inhabitants
of

trembling
shall
take
hold
upon
them
all
the
inhabitants
of

shall
melt
away
15
16
fear
and
dread
shall
fall
upon
them
by
the
greatness
of
thine
arm
they
shall
be
as
still
as
a
stone
till
thy
people
pass
over
o
lord
till
the
people
pass
over
which
thou
hast
purchased
15
17
thou
shalt
bring
them
in
and
plant
them
in
the
mountain
of
thine
inheritance
in
the
place
o
lord
which
thou
hast
made
for
thee
to
dwell
in
in
the
sanctuary
o
lord
which
thy
hands
have
established
15
18
the
lord
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
15
19
for
the
horse
of
pharaoh
went
in
with
his
chariots
and
with
his
horsemen
into
the
sea
and
the
lord
brought
again
the
waters
of
the
sea
upon
them
but
the
children
of
israel
went
on
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
15
20
and
miriam
the
prophetess
the
sister
of
aaron
took
a
timbrel
in
her
hand
and
all
the
women
went
out
after
her
with
timbrels
and
with
dances
15
21
and
miriam
answered
them
sing
ye
to
the
lord
for
he
hath
triumphed
gloriously
the
horse
and
his
rider
hath
he
thrown
into
the
sea
15
22
so
moses
brought
israel
from
the
red
sea
and
they
went
out
into
the
wilderness
of
shur
and
they
went
three
days
in
the
wilderness
and
found
no
water
15
23
and
when
they
came
to
marah
they
could
not
drink
of
the
waters
of
marah
for
they
were
bitter
therefore
the
name
of
it
was
called
marah
15
24
and
the
people
murmured
against
moses
saying
what
shall
we
drink
15
25
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
shewed
him
a
tree
which
when
he
had
cast
into
the
waters
the
waters
were
made
sweet
there
he
made
for
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
and
there
he
proved
them
15
26
and
said
if
thou
wilt
diligently
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
wilt
do
that
which
is
right
in
his
sight
and
wilt
give
ear
to
his
commandments
and
keep
all
his
statutes
i
will
put
none
of
these
diseases
upon
thee
which
i
have
brought
upon
the
egyptians
for
i
am
the
lord
that
healeth
thee
15
27
and
they
came
to
elim
where
were
twelve
wells
of
water
and
threescore
and
ten
palm
trees
and
they
encamped
there
by
the
waters
16
1
and
they
took
their
journey
from
elim
and
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
came
unto
the
wilderness
of
sin
which
is
between
elim
and
sinai
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
second
month
after
their
departing
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
16
2
and
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
aaron
in
the
wilderness
16
3
and
the
children
of
israel
said
unto
them
would
to
god
we
had
died
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
in
the
land
of
egypt
when
we
sat
by
the
flesh
pots
and
when
we
did
eat
bread
to
the
full
for
ye
have
brought
us
forth
into
this
wilderness
to
kill
this
whole
assembly
with
hunger
16
4
then
said
the
lord
unto
moses
behold
i
will
rain
bread
from
heaven
for
you
and
the
people
shall
go
out
and
gather
a
certain
rate
every
day
that
i
may
prove
them
whether
they
will
walk
in
my
law
or
no
16
5
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
shall
prepare
that
which
they
bring
in
and
it
shall
be
twice
as
much
as
they
gather
daily
16
6
and
moses
and
aaron
said
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
at
even
then
ye
shall
know
that
the
lord
hath
brought
you
out
from
the
land
of
egypt
16
7
and
in
the
morning
then
ye
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
lord
for
that
he
heareth
your
murmurings
against
the
lord
and
what
are
we
that
ye
murmur
against
us
16
8
and
moses
said
this
shall
be
when
the
lord
shall
give
you
in
the
evening
flesh
to
eat
and
in
the
morning
bread
to
the
full
for
that
the
lord
heareth
your
murmurings
which
ye
murmur
against
him
and
what
are
we
your
murmurings
are
not
against
us
but
against
the
lord
16
9
and
moses
spake
unto
aaron
say
unto
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
come
near
before
the
lord
for
he
hath
heard
your
murmurings
16
10
and
it
came
to
pass
as
aaron
spake
unto
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
that
they
looked
toward
the
wilderness
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
in
the
cloud
16
11
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
16
12
i
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
israel
speak
unto
them
saying
at
even
ye
shall
eat
flesh
and
in
the
morning
ye
shall
be
filled
with
bread
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
16
13
and
it
came
to
pass
that
at
even
the
quails
came
up
and
covered
the
camp
and
in
the
morning
the
dew
lay
round
about
the
host
16
14
and
when
the
dew
that
lay
was
gone
up
behold
upon
the
face
of
the
wilderness
there
lay
a
small
round
thing
as
small
as
the
hoar
frost
on
the
ground
16
15
and
when
the
children
of
israel
saw
it
they
said
one
to
another
it
is
manna
for
they
wist
not
what
it
was
and
moses
said
unto
them
this
is
the
bread
which
the
lord
hath
given
you
to
eat
16
16
this
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
gather
of
it
every
man
according
to
his
eating
an
omer
for
every
man
according
to
the
number
of
your
persons
take
ye
every
man
for
them
which
are
in
his
tents
16
17
and
the
children
of
israel
did
so
and
gathered
some
more
some
less
16
18
and
when
they
did
mete
it
with
an
omer
he
that
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
he
that
gathered
little
had
no
lack
they
gathered
every
man
according
to
his
eating
16
19
and
moses
said
let
no
man
leave
of
it
till
the
morning
16
20
notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
moses
but
some
of
them
left
of
it
until
the
morning
and
it
bred
worms
and
stank
and
moses
was
wroth
with
them
16
21
and
they
gathered
it
every
morning
every
man
according
to
his
eating
and
when
the
sun
waxed
hot
it
melted
16
22
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
gathered
twice
as
much
bread
two
omers
for
one
man
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
came
and
told
moses
16
23
and
he
said
unto
them
this
is
that
which
the
lord
hath
said
to
morrow
is
the
rest
of
the
holy
sabbath
unto
the
lord
bake
that
which
ye
will
bake
to
day
and
seethe
that
ye
will
seethe
and
that
which
remaineth
over
lay
up
for
you
to
be
kept
until
the
morning
16
24
and
they
laid
it
up
till
the
morning
as
moses
bade
and
it
did
not
stink
neither
was
there
any
worm
therein
16
25
and
moses
said
eat
that
to
day
for
to
day
is
a
sabbath
unto
the
lord
to
day
ye
shall
not
find
it
in
the
field
16
26
six
days
ye
shall
gather
it
but
on
the
seventh
day
which
is
the
sabbath
in
it
there
shall
be
none
16
27
and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
went
out
some
of
the
people
on
the
seventh
day
for
to
gather
and
they
found
none
16
28
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
how
long
refuse
ye
to
keep
my
commandments
and
my
laws
16
29
see
for
that
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
sabbath
therefore
he
giveth
you
on
the
sixth
day
the
bread
of
two
days
abide
ye
every
man
in
his
place
let
no
man
go
out
of
his
place
on
the
seventh
day
16
30
so
the
people
rested
on
the
seventh
day
16
31
and
the
house
of
israel
called
the
name
thereof
manna
and
it
was
like
coriander
seed
white
and
the
taste
of
it
was
like
wafers
made
with
honey
16
32
and
moses
said
this
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
commandeth
fill
an
omer
of
it
to
be
kept
for
your
generations
that
they
may
see
the
bread
wherewith
i
have
fed
you
in
the
wilderness
when
i
brought
you
forth
from
the
land
of
egypt
16
33
and
moses
said
unto
aaron
take
a
pot
and
put
an
omer
full
of
manna
therein
and
lay
it
up
before
the
lord
to
be
kept
for
your
generations
16
34
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
aaron
laid
it
up
before
the
testimony
to
be
kept
16
35
and
the
children
of
israel
did
eat
manna
forty
years
until
they
came
to
a
land
inhabited
they
did
eat
manna
until
they
came
unto
the
borders
of
the
land
of
canaan
16
36
now
an
omer
is
the
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
17
1
and
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
journeyed
from
the
wilderness
of
sin
after
their
journeys
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
pitched
in
rephidim
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
people
to
drink
17
2
wherefore
the
people
did
chide
with
moses
and
said
give
us
water
that
we
may
drink
and
moses
said
unto
them
why
chide
ye
with
me
wherefore
do
ye
tempt
the
lord
17
3
and
the
people
thirsted
there
for
water
and
the
people
murmured
against
moses
and
said
wherefore
is
this
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
egypt
to
kill
us
and
our
children
and
our
cattle
with
thirst
17
4
and
moses
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
what
shall
i
do
unto
this
people
they
be
almost
ready
to
stone
me
17
5
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
on
before
the
people
and
take
with
thee
of
the
elders
of
israel
and
thy
rod
wherewith
thou
smotest
the
river
take
in
thine
hand
and
go
17
6
behold
i
will
stand
before
thee
there
upon
the
rock
in
horeb
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
rock
and
there
shall
come
water
out
of
it
that
the
people
may
drink
and
moses
did
so
in
the
sight
of
the
elders
of
israel
17
7
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
massah
and
meribah
because
of
the
chiding
of
the
children
of
israel
and
because
they
tempted
the
lord
saying
is
the
lord
among
us
or
not
17
8
then
came
amalek
and
fought
with
israel
in
rephidim
17
9
and
moses
said
unto
joshua
choose
us
out
men
and
go
out
fight
with
amalek
to
morrow
i
will
stand
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
rod
of
god
in
mine
hand
17
10
so
joshua
did
as
moses
had
said
to
him
and
fought
with
amalek
and
moses
aaron
and
hur
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
17
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
held
up
his
hand
that
israel
prevailed
and
when
he
let
down
his
hand
amalek
prevailed
17
12
but
moses’
hands
were
heavy
and
they
took
a
stone
and
put
it
under
him
and
he
sat
thereon
and
aaron
and
hur
stayed
up
his
hands
the
one
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
and
his
hands
were
steady
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
17
13
and
joshua
discomfited
amalek
and
his
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
17
14
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
write
this
for
a
memorial
in
a
book
and
rehearse
it
in
the
ears
of
joshua
for
i
will
utterly
put
out
the
remembrance
of
amalek
from
under
heaven
17
15
and
moses
built
an
altar
and
called
the
name
of
it
jehovahnissi
17
16
for
he
said
because
the
lord
hath
sworn
that
the
lord
will
have
war
with
amalek
from
generation
to
generation
18
1
when
jethro
the
priest
of
midian
moses’
father
in
law
heard
of
all
that
god
had
done
for
moses
and
for
israel
his
people
and
that
the
lord
had
brought
israel
out
of
egypt
18
2
then
jethro
moses’
father
in
law
took
zipporah
moses’
wife
after
he
had
sent
her
back
18
3
and
her
two
sons
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
gershom
for
he
said
i
have
been
an
alien
in
a
strange
land
18
4
and
the
name
of
the
other
was
eliezer
for
the
god
of
my
father
said
he
was
mine
help
and
delivered
me
from
the
sword
of
pharaoh
18
5
and
jethro
moses’
father
in
law
came
with
his
sons
and
his
wife
unto
moses
into
the
wilderness
where
he
encamped
at
the
mount
of
god
18
6
and
he
said
unto
moses
i
thy
father
in
law
jethro
am
come
unto
thee
and
thy
wife
and
her
two
sons
with
her
18
7
and
moses
went
out
to
meet
his
father
in
law
and
did
obeisance
and
kissed
him
and
they
asked
each
other
of
their
welfare
and
they
came
into
the
tent
18
8
and
moses
told
his
father
in
law
all
that
the
lord
had
done
unto
pharaoh
and
to
the
egyptians
for
israel’s
sake
and
all
the
travail
that
had
come
upon
them
by
the
way
and
how
the
lord
delivered
them
18
9
and
jethro
rejoiced
for
all
the
goodness
which
the
lord
had
done
to
israel
whom
he
had
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
18
10
and
jethro
said
blessed
be
the
lord
who
hath
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
out
of
the
hand
of
pharaoh
who
hath
delivered
the
people
from
under
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
18
11
now
i
know
that
the
lord
is
greater
than
all
gods
for
in
the
thing
wherein
they
dealt
proudly
he
was
above
them
18
12
and
jethro
moses’
father
in
law
took
a
burnt
offering
and
sacrifices
for
god
and
aaron
came
and
all
the
elders
of
israel
to
eat
bread
with
moses’
father
in
law
before
god
18
13
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
moses
sat
to
judge
the
people
and
the
people
stood
by
moses
from
the
morning
unto
the
evening
18
14
and
when
moses’
father
in
law
saw
all
that
he
did
to
the
people
he
said
what
is
this
thing
that
thou
doest
to
the
people
why
sittest
thou
thyself
alone
and
all
the
people
stand
by
thee
from
morning
unto
even
18
15
and
moses
said
unto
his
father
in
law
because
the
people
come
unto
me
to
enquire
of
god
18
16
when
they
have
a
matter
they
come
unto
me
and
i
judge
between
one
and
another
and
i
do
make
them
know
the
statutes
of
god
and
his
laws
18
17
and
moses’
father
in
law
said
unto
him
the
thing
that
thou
doest
is
not
good
18
18
thou
wilt
surely
wear
away
both
thou
and
this
people
that
is
with
thee
for
this
thing
is
too
heavy
for
thee
thou
art
not
able
to
perform
it
thyself
alone
18
19
hearken
now
unto
my
voice
i
will
give
thee
counsel
and
god
shall
be
with
thee
be
thou
for
the
people
to
god-ward
that
thou
mayest
bring
the
causes
unto
god
18
20
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
ordinances
and
laws
and
shalt
shew
them
the
way
wherein
they
must
walk
and
the
work
that
they
must
do
18
21
moreover
thou
shalt
provide
out
of
all
the
people
able
men
such
as
fear
god
men
of
truth
hating
covetousness
and
place
such
over
them
to
be
rulers
of
thousands
and
rulers
of
hundreds
rulers
of
fifties
and
rulers
of
tens
18
22
and
let
them
judge
the
people
at
all
seasons
and
it
shall
be
that
every
great
matter
they
shall
bring
unto
thee
but
every
small
matter
they
shall
judge
so
shall
it
be
easier
for
thyself
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
with
thee
18
23
if
thou
shalt
do
this
thing
and
god
command
thee
so
then
thou
shalt
be
able
to
endure
and
all
this
people
shall
also
go
to
their
place
in
peace
18
24
so
moses
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
his
father
in
law
and
did
all
that
he
had
said
18
25
and
moses
chose
able
men
out
of
all
israel
and
made
them
heads
over
the
people
rulers
of
thousands
rulers
of
hundreds
rulers
of
fifties
and
rulers
of
tens
18
26
and
they
judged
the
people
at
all
seasons
the
hard
causes
they
brought
unto
moses
but
every
small
matter
they
judged
themselves
18
27
and
moses
let
his
father
in
law
depart
and
he
went
his
way
into
his
own
land
19
1
in
the
third
month
when
the
children
of
israel
were
gone
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
the
same
day
came
they
into
the
wilderness
of
sinai
19
2
for
they
were
departed
from
rephidim
and
were
come
to
the
desert
of
sinai
and
had
pitched
in
the
wilderness
and
there
israel
camped
before
the
mount
19
3
and
moses
went
up
unto
god
and
the
lord
called
unto
him
out
of
the
mountain
saying
thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
house
of
jacob
and
tell
the
children
of
israel
19
4
ye
have
seen
what
i
did
unto
the
egyptians
and
how
i
bare
you
on
eagles’
wings
and
brought
you
unto
myself
19
5
now
therefore
if
ye
will
obey
my
voice
indeed
and
keep
my
covenant
then
ye
shall
be
a
peculiar
treasure
unto
me
above
all
people
for
all
the
earth
is
mine
19
6
and
ye
shall
be
unto
me
a
kingdom
of
priests
and
an
holy
nation
these
are
the
words
which
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
19
7
and
moses
came
and
called
for
the
elders
of
the
people
and
laid
before
their
faces
all
these
words
which
the
lord
commanded
him
19
8
and
all
the
people
answered
together
and
said
all
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
we
will
do
and
moses
returned
the
words
of
the
people
unto
the
lord
19
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
lo
i
come
unto
thee
in
a
thick
cloud
that
the
people
may
hear
when
i
speak
with
thee
and
believe
thee
for
ever
and
moses
told
the
words
of
the
people
unto
the
lord
19
10
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
unto
the
people
and
sanctify
them
to
day
and
to
morrow
and
let
them
wash
their
clothes
19
11
and
be
ready
against
the
third
day
for
the
third
day
the
lord
will
come
down
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
upon
mount
sinai
19
12
and
thou
shalt
set
bounds
unto
the
people
round
about
saying
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
ye
go
not
up
into
the
mount
or
touch
the
border
of
it
whosoever
toucheth
the
mount
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
19
13
there
shall
not
an
hand
touch
it
but
he
shall
surely
be
stoned
or
shot
through
whether
it
be
beast
or
man
it
shall
not
live
when
the
trumpet
soundeth
long
they
shall
come
up
to
the
mount
19
14
and
moses
went
down
from
the
mount
unto
the
people
and
sanctified
the
people
and
they
washed
their
clothes
19
15
and
he
said
unto
the
people
be
ready
against
the
third
day
come
not
at
your
wives
19
16
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day
in
the
morning
that
there
were
thunders
and
lightnings
and
a
thick
cloud
upon
the
mount
and
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
exceeding
loud
so
that
all
the
people
that
was
in
the
camp
trembled
19
17
and
moses
brought
forth
the
people
out
of
the
camp
to
meet
with
god
and
they
stood
at
the
nether
part
of
the
mount
19
18
and
mount
sinai
was
altogether
on
a
smoke
because
the
lord
descended
upon
it
in
fire
and
the
smoke
thereof
ascended
as
the
smoke
of
a
furnace
and
the
whole
mount
quaked
greatly
19
19
and
when
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
sounded
long
and
waxed
louder
and
louder
moses
spake
and
god
answered
him
by
a
voice
19
20
and
the
lord
came
down
upon
mount
sinai
on
the
top
of
the
mount
and
the
lord
called
moses
up
to
the
top
of
the
mount
and
moses
went
up
19
21
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
down
charge
the
people
lest
they
break
through
unto
the
lord
to
gaze
and
many
of
them
perish
19
22
and
let
the
priests
also
which
come
near
to
the
lord
sanctify
themselves
lest
the
lord
break
forth
upon
them
19
23
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
the
people
cannot
come
up
to
mount
sinai
for
thou
chargedst
us
saying
set
bounds
about
the
mount
and
sanctify
it
19
24
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
away
get
thee
down
and
thou
shalt
come
up
thou
and
aaron
with
thee
but
let
not
the
priests
and
the
people
break
through
to
come
up
unto
the
lord
lest
he
break
forth
upon
them
19
25
so
moses
went
down
unto
the
people
and
spake
unto
them
20
1
and
god
spake
all
these
words
saying
20
2
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
have
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
20
3
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
20
4
thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above
or
that
is
in
the
earth
beneath
or
that
is
in
the
water
under
the
earth
20
5
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
to
them
nor
serve
them
for
i
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
20
6
and
shewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
20
7
thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain
20
8
remember
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
20
9
six
days
shalt
thou
labour
and
do
all
thy
work
20
10
but
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
it
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
thy
manservant
nor
thy
maidservant
nor
thy
cattle
nor
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
20
11
for
in
six
days
the
lord
made
heaven
and
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
and
rested
the
seventh
day
wherefore
the
lord
blessed
the
sabbath
day
and
hallowed
it
20
12
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
20
13
thou
shalt
not
kill
20
14
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
20
15
thou
shalt
not
steal
20
16
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbour
20
17
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour’s
house
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour’s
wife
nor
his
manservant
nor
his
maidservant
nor
his
ox
nor
his
ass
nor
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbour’s
20
18
and
all
the
people
saw
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
the
noise
of
the
trumpet
and
the
mountain
smoking
and
when
the
people
saw
it
they
removed
and
stood
afar
off
20
19
and
they
said
unto
moses
speak
thou
with
us
and
we
will
hear
but
let
not
god
speak
with
us
lest
we
die
20
20
and
moses
said
unto
the
people
fear
not
for
god
is
come
to
prove
you
and
that
his
fear
may
be
before
your
faces
that
ye
sin
not
20
21
and
the
people
stood
afar
off
and
moses
drew
near
unto
the
thick
darkness
where
god
was
20
22
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
thus
thou
shalt
say
unto
the
children
of
israel
ye
have
seen
that
i
have
talked
with
you
from
heaven
20
23
ye
shall
not
make
with
me
gods
of
silver
neither
shall
ye
make
unto
you
gods
of
gold
20
24
an
altar
of
earth
thou
shalt
make
unto
me
and
shalt
sacrifice
thereon
thy
burnt
offerings
and
thy
peace
offerings
thy
sheep
and
thine
oxen
in
all
places
where
i
record
my
name
i
will
come
unto
thee
and
i
will
bless
thee
20
25
and
if
thou
wilt
make
me
an
altar
of
stone
thou
shalt
not
build
it
of
hewn
stone
for
if
thou
lift
up
thy
tool
upon
it
thou
hast
polluted
it
20
26
neither
shalt
thou
go
up
by
steps
unto
mine
altar
that
thy
nakedness
be
not
discovered
thereon
21
1
now
these
are
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
set
before
them
21
2
if
thou
buy
an
hebrew
servant
six
years
he
shall
serve
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
21
3
if
he
came
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
21
4
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
born
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
her
master’s
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
21
5
and
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
21
6
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
he
shall
also
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
door
post
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
aul
and
he
shall
serve
him
for
ever
21
7
and
if
a
man
sell
his
daughter
to
be
a
maidservant
she
shall
not
go
out
as
the
menservants
do
21
8
if
she
please
not
her
master
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
unto
a
strange
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
21
9
and
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
21
10
if
he
take
him
another
wife
her
food
her
raiment
and
her
duty
of
marriage
shall
he
not
diminish
21
11
and
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her
then
shall
she
go
out
free
without
money
21
12
he
that
smiteth
a
man
so
that
he
die
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
21
13
and
if
a
man
lie
not
in
wait
but
god
deliver
him
into
his
hand
then
i
will
appoint
thee
a
place
whither
he
shall
flee
21
14
but
if
a
man
come
presumptuously
upon
his
neighbour
to
slay
him
with
guile
thou
shalt
take
him
from
mine
altar
that
he
may
die
21
15
and
he
that
smiteth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
21
16
and
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
21
17
and
he
that
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
21
18
and
if
men
strive
together
and
one
smite
another
with
a
stone
or
with
his
fist
and
he
die
not
but
keepeth
his
bed
21
19
if
he
rise
again
and
walk
abroad
upon
his
staff
then
shall
he
that
smote
him
be
quit
only
he
shall
pay
for
the
loss
of
his
time
and
shall
cause
him
to
be
thoroughly
healed
21
20
and
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
he
shall
be
surely
punished
21
21
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
21
22
if
men
strive
and
hurt
a
woman
with
child
so
that
her
fruit
depart
from
her
and
yet
no
mischief
follow
he
shall
be
surely
punished
according
as
the
woman’s
husband
will
lay
upon
him
and
he
shall
pay
as
the
judges
determine
21
23
and
if
any
mischief
follow
then

voice
provoke
him
not
for
he

not
pardon
your

22
but
if
thou

indeed
obey

i
speak
then
i
will
be
an
enemy
unto
thine
enemies
and
an
adversary
unto
thine
adversaries

mine
angel
shall

off
23
24
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
to
their
gods
nor
serve
them
nor
do
after
their
works
but
thou
shalt
utterly
overthrow
them
and
quite
break
down
their
images
23
25
and
ye
shall
serve
the
lord
your
god
and
he
shall
bless
thy
bread
and
thy
water
and
i
will
take
sickness
away
from
the
midst
of
thee
23
26
there
shall
nothing
cast
their
young
nor
be
barren
in
thy
land
the
number
of
thy
days
i
will
fulfil
23
27
i
will
send
my
fear
before
thee
and
will
destroy
all
the
people
to
whom
thou
shalt
come
and
i
will
make
all
thine
enemies
turn
their
backs
unto
thee
23
28
and
i
will
send
hornets
before
thee
which
shall
drive
out
the
hivite
the
canaanite
and
the
hittite
from
before
thee
23
29
i
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
in
one
year
lest
the
land
become
desolate
and
the
beast
of
the
field
multiply
against
thee
23
30
by
little
and
little
i
will
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
until
thou
be
increased
and
inherit
the
land
23
31
and
i
will
set
thy
bounds
from
the
red
sea
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
philistines
and
from
the
desert
unto
the
river
for
i
will
deliver
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
your
hand
and
thou
shalt
drive
them
out
before
thee
23
32
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them
nor
with
their
gods
23
33
they
shall
not
dwell
in
thy
land
lest
they
make
thee
sin
against
me
for
if
thou
serve
their
gods
it
will
surely
be
a
snare
unto
thee
24

and
he
said
unto
moses
come
up
unto
the

thou
and
aaron
nadab

but
they
shall
not
come
nigh
neither

the
people
go
up
with

24
3
and

came
and
told
the
people
all
the
words
of
the
lord
and
all
the
judgments
and
all
the
people
answered
with
one
voice
and
said
all
the
words
which
the
lord
hath
said
will
we
do
24
4
and
moses
wrote
all
the
words
of
the
lord
and
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
builded
an
altar
under
the
hill
and
twelve
pillars
according
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
24
5
and
he
sent
young
men
of
the
children
of
israel
which
offered
burnt
offerings
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings
of
oxen
unto
the
lord
24
6
and
moses
took
half
of
the
blood
and
put
it
in
basons
and
half
of
the
blood
he
sprinkled
on
the
altar
24
7
and
he
took
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
read
in
the
audience
of
the
people
and
they
said
all
that
the
lord
hath
said
will
we
do
and
be
obedient
24
8
and
moses
took
the
blood
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
people
and
said
behold
the
blood
of
the
covenant
which
the
lord
hath
made
with
you
concerning
all
these
words
24
9
then
went
up
moses
and
aaron
nadab
and
abihu
and
seventy
of
the
elders
of
israel
24
10
and
they
saw
the
god
of
israel
and
there
was
under
his
feet
as
it
were
a
paved
work
of
a
sapphire
stone
and
as
it
were
the
body
of
heaven
in
his
clearness
24
11
and
upon
the
nobles
of
the
children
of
israel
he
laid
not
his
hand
also
they
saw
god
and
did
eat
and
drink
24
12
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
come
up
to
me
into
the
mount
and
be
there
and
i
will
give
thee
tables
of
stone
and
a
law
and
commandments
which
i
have
written
that
thou
mayest
teach
them
24
13
and
moses
rose
up
and
his
minister
joshua
and
moses
went
up
into
the
mount
of
god
24
14
and
he
said
unto
the
elders
tarry
ye
here
for
us
until
we
come
again
unto
you
and
behold
aaron
and
hur
are
with
you
if
any
man
have
any
matters
to
do
let
him
come
unto
them
24
15
and
moses
went
up
into
the
mount
and
a
cloud
covered
the
mount
24
16
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
abode

thou
also
unto

saying
verily

between

that
ye
may

i
am
the

31
14
ye

therefore
for

every

for
whosoever

31
15
six
days

seventh
is

the
lord
whosoever
doeth
any
work
in

sabbath
day
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
31
16
wherefore
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
the
sabbath
to
observe
the
sabbath
throughout
their
generations
for
a
perpetual
covenant
31
17
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
the
children
of
israel
for
ever
for
in
six
days
the
lord
made
heaven
and
earth
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
rested
and
was
refreshed
31
18
and
he
gave
unto
moses
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
communing
with
him
upon
mount
sinai
two
tables
of
testimony
tables
of
stone
written
with
the
finger
of
god
32
1
and
when
the
people
saw
that
moses
delayed
to
come
down
out
of
the
mount
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
unto
aaron
and
said
unto
him
up
make
us
gods
which
shall
go
before
us
for
as
for
this
moses
the
man
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him
32
2
and
aaron
said
unto
them
break
off
the
golden
earrings
which
are
in
the
ears
of
your
wives
of
your
sons
and
of
your
daughters
and
bring
them
unto
me
32
3
and
all
the
people
brake
off
the
golden
earrings
which
were
in
their
ears
and
brought
them
unto
aaron
32
4
and
he
received
them
at
their
hand
and
fashioned
it
with
a
graving
tool
after
he
had
made
it
a
molten
calf
and
they
said
these
be
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
32
5
and
when
aaron
saw
it
he
built
an
altar
before
it
and
aaron
made
proclamation
and
said
to
morrow
is
a
feast
to
the
lord
32
6
and
they
rose
up
early
on
the
morrow
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
brought
peace
offerings
and
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
rose
up
to
play
32
7
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
go
get
thee
down
for
thy
people
which
thou
broughtest
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
have
corrupted
themselves
32
8
they
have
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
i
commanded
them
they
have
made
them
a
molten
calf
and
have
worshipped
it
and
have
sacrificed
thereunto
and
said
these
be
thy
gods
o
israel
which
have
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
32
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
i
have
seen
this
people
and
behold
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people
32
10
now
therefore
let
me
alone
that
my
wrath
may
wax
hot
against
them
and
that
i
may
consume
them
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation
32
11
and
moses
besought
the
lord
his
god
and
said
lord
why
doth
thy
wrath
wax
hot
against
thy
people
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
great
power
and
with
a
mighty
hand
32
12
wherefore
should
the
egyptians
speak
and
say
for
mischief
did
he
bring
them
out
to
slay
them
in
the
mountains
and
to
consume
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth
turn
from
thy
fierce
wrath
and
repent
of
this
evil
against
thy
people
32
13
remember
abraham
isaac
and
israel
thy
servants
to
whom
thou
swarest
by
thine
own
self
and
saidst
unto
them
i
will
multiply
your
seed
as
the
stars
of
heaven
and
all
this
land
that
i
have
spoken
of
will
i
give
unto
your
seed
and
they
shall
inherit
it
for
ever
32
14
and
the
lord
repented
of
the
evil
which
he
thought
to
do
unto
his
people
32
15
and
moses
turned
and
went
down
from
the
mount
and
the
two
tables
of
the
testimony
were
in
his
hand
the
tables
were
written
on
both
their
sides
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
were
they
written
32
16
and
the
tables
were
the
work
of
god
and
the
writing
was
the
writing
of
god
graven
upon
the
tables
32
17
and
when
joshua
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
as
they
shouted
he
said
unto
moses
there
is
a
noise
of
war
in
the
camp
32
18
and
he
said
it
is
not
the
voice
of
them
that
shout
for
mastery
neither
is
it
the
voice
of
them
that
cry
for
being
overcome
but
the
noise
of
them
that
sing
do
i
hear
32
19
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
he
came
nigh
unto
the
camp
that
he
saw
the
calf
and
the
dancing
and
moses’
anger
waxed
hot
and
he
cast
the
tables
out
of
his
hands
and
brake
them
beneath
the
mount
32
20
and
he
took
the
calf
which
they
had
made
and
burnt
it
in
the
fire
and
ground
it
to
powder
and
strawed
it
upon
the
water
and
made
the
children
of
israel
drink
of
it
32
21
and
moses
said
unto
aaron
what
did
this
people
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
brought
so
great
a
sin
upon
them
32
22
and
aaron
said
let
not
the
anger
of
my
lord
wax
hot
thou
knowest
the
people
that
they
are
set
on
mischief
32
23
for
they
said
unto
me
make
us
gods
which
shall
go
before
us
for
as
for
this
moses
the
man
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him
32
24
and
i
said
unto
them
whosoever
hath
any
gold
let
them
break
it
off
so
they
gave
it
me
then
i
cast
it
into
the
fire
and
there
came
out
this
calf
32
25
and
when
moses
saw
that
the
people
were
naked
(for
aaron
had
made
them
naked
unto
their
shame
among
their
enemies
)
32
26
then
moses
stood
in
the
gate
of
the
camp
and
said
who
is
on
the
lord’s
side
let
him
come
unto
me
and
all
the
sons
of
levi
gathered
themselves
together
unto
him
32
27
and
he
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
put
every
man
his
sword
by
his
side
and
go
in
and
out
from
gate
to
gate
throughout
the
camp
and
slay
every
man
his
brother
and
every
man
his
companion
and
every
man
his
neighbour
32
28
and
the
children
of
levi
did
according
to
the
word
of
moses
and
there
fell
of
the
people
that
day
about
three
thousand
men
32
29
for
moses
had
said
consecrate
yourselves
today
to
the
lord
even
every
man
upon
his
son
and
upon
his
brother
that
he
may
bestow
upon
you
a
blessing
this
day
32
30
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
moses
said
unto
the
people
ye
have
sinned
a
great
sin
and
now
i
will
go
up
unto
the
lord
peradventure
i
shall
make
an
atonement
for
your
sin
32
31
and
moses
returned
unto
the
lord
and
said
oh
this
people
have
sinned
a
great
sin
and
have
made
them
gods
of
gold
32
32
yet
now
if
thou
wilt
forgive
their
sin--
and
if
not
blot
me
i
pray
thee
out
of
thy
book
which
thou
hast
written
32
33
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
whosoever
hath
sinned
against
me
him
will
i
blot
out
of
my
book
32
34
therefore
now
go
lead
the
people
unto
the
place
of
which
i
have
spoken
unto
thee
behold
mine
angel
shall
go
before
thee
nevertheless
in
the
day
when
i
visit
i
will
visit
their
sin
upon
them
32
35
and
the
lord
plagued
the
people
because
they
made
the
calf
which
aaron
made
33
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
depart
and
go
up
hence
thou
and
the
people
which
thou
hast
brought
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
unto
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
saying
unto
thy
seed
will
i
give
it
33
2
and
i
will
send
an
angel
before
thee
and
i
will
drive
out
the
canaanite
the
amorite
and
the
hittite
and
the
perizzite
the
hivite
and
the
jebusite
33
3
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
for
i
will
not
go
up
in
the
midst
of
thee
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
people
lest
i
consume
thee
in
the
way
33
4
and
when
the
people
heard
these
evil
tidings
they
mourned
and
no
man
did
put
on
him
his
ornaments
33
5
for
the
lord
had
said
unto
moses
say
unto
the
children
of
israel
ye
are
a
stiffnecked
people
i
will
come
up
into
the
midst
of
thee
in
a
moment
and
consume
thee
therefore
now
put
off
thy
ornaments
from
thee
that
i
may
know
what
to
do
unto
thee
33
6
and
the
children
of
israel
stripped
themselves
of
their
ornaments
by
the
mount
horeb
33
7
and
moses
took
the
tabernacle
and
pitched
it
without
the
camp
afar
off
from
the
camp
and
called
it
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
it
came
to
pass
that
every
one
which
sought
the
lord
went
out
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
which
was
without
the
camp
33
8
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
went
out
unto
the
tabernacle
that
all
the
people
rose
up
and
stood
every
man
at
his
tent
door
and
looked
after
moses
until
he
was
gone
into
the
tabernacle
33
9
and
it
came
to
pass
as
moses
entered
into
the
tabernacle
the
cloudy
pillar
descended
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
lord
talked
with
moses
33
10
and
all
the
people
saw
the
cloudy
pillar
stand
at
the
tabernacle
door
and
all
the
people
rose
up
and
worshipped
every
man
in
his
tent
door
33
11
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
face
to
face
as
a
man
speaketh
unto
his
friend
and
he
turned
again
into
the
camp
but
his
servant
joshua
the
son
of
nun
a
young
man
departed
not
out
of
the
tabernacle
33
12
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
see
thou
sayest
unto
me
bring
up
this
people
and
thou
hast
not
let
me
know
whom
thou
wilt
send
with
me
yet
thou
hast
said
i
know
thee
by
name
and
thou
hast
also
found
grace
in
my
sight
33
13
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
if
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
shew
me
now
thy
way
that
i
may
know
thee
that
i
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight
and
consider
that
this
nation
is
thy
people
33
14
and
he
said
my
presence
shall
go
with
thee
and
i
will
give
thee
rest
33
15
and
he
said
unto
him
if
thy
presence
go
not
with
me
carry
us
not
up
hence
33
16
for
wherein
shall
it
be
known
here
that
i
and
thy
people
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
is
it
not
in
that
thou
goest
with
us
so
shall
we
be
separated
i
and
thy
people
from
all
the
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
33
17
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
i
will
do
this
thing
also
that
thou
hast
spoken
for
thou
hast
found
grace
in
my
sight
and
i
know
thee
by
name
33
18
and
he
said
i
beseech
thee
shew
me
thy
glory
33
19
and
he
said
i
will
make
all
my
goodness
pass
before
thee
and
i
will
proclaim
the
name
of
the
lord
before
thee
and
will
be
gracious
to
whom
i
will
be
gracious
and
will
shew
mercy
on
whom
i
will
shew
mercy
33
20
and
he
said
thou
canst
not
see
my
face
for
there
shall
no
man
see
me
and
live
33
21
and
the
lord
said
behold
there
is
a
place
by
me
and
thou
shalt
stand
upon
a
rock
33
22
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
while
my
glory
passeth
by
that
i
will
put
thee
in
a
clift
of
the
rock
and
will
cover
thee
with
my
hand
while
i
pass
by
33
23
and
i
will
take
away
mine
hand
and
thou
shalt
see
my
back
parts
but
my
face
shall
not
be
seen
34
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
i
will
write
upon
these
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables
which
thou
brakest
34
2
and
be
ready
in
the
morning
and
come
up
in
the
morning
unto
mount
sinai
and
present
thyself
there
to
me
in
the
top
of
the
mount
34
3
and
no
man
shall
come
up
with
thee
neither
let
any
man
be
seen
throughout
all
the
mount
neither
let
the
flocks
nor
herds
feed
before
that
mount
34
4
and
he
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
moses
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
went
up
unto
mount
sinai
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
took
in
his
hand
the
two
tables
of
stone
34
5
and
the
lord
descended
in
the
cloud
and
stood
with
him
there
and
proclaimed
the
name
of
the
lord
34
6
and
the
lord
passed
by
before
him
and
proclaimed
the
lord
the
lord
god
merciful
and
gracious
longsuffering
and
abundant
in
goodness
and
truth
34
7
keeping
mercy
for
thousands
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
sin
and
that
will
by
no
means
clear
the
guilty
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
and
upon
the
children’s
children
unto
the
third
and
to
the
fourth
generation
34
8
and
moses
made
haste
and
bowed
his
head
toward
the
earth
and
worshipped
34
9
and
he
said
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
o
lord
let
my
lord
i
pray
thee
go
among
us
for
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people
and
pardon
our
iniquity
and
our
sin
and
take
us
for
thine
inheritance
34
10
and
he
said
behold
i
make
a
covenant
before
all
thy
people
i
will
do
marvels
such
as
have
not
been
done
in
all
the
earth
nor
in
any
nation
and
all
the
people
among
which
thou
art
shall
see
the
work
of
the
lord
for
it
is
a
terrible
thing
that
i
will
do
with
thee
34
11
observe
thou
that
which
i
command
thee
this
day
behold
i
drive
out
before
thee
the
amorite
and
the
canaanite
and
the
hittite
and
the
perizzite
and
the
hivite
and
the
jebusite
34
12
take
heed
to
thyself
lest
thou
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
whither
thou
goest
lest
it
be
for
a
snare
in
the
midst
of
thee
34
13
but
ye
shall
destroy
their
altars
break
their
images
and
cut
down
their
groves
34
14
for
thou
shalt
worship
no
other
god
for
the
lord
whose
name
is
jealous
is
a
jealous
god
34
15
lest
thou
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
they
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods
and
do
sacrifice
unto
their
gods
and
one
call
thee
and
thou
eat
of
his
sacrifice
34
16
and
thou
take
of
their
daughters
unto
thy
sons
and
their
daughters
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods
and
make
thy
sons
go
a
whoring
after
their
gods
34
17
thou
shalt
make
thee
no
molten
gods
34
18
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
shalt
thou
keep
seven
days
thou
shalt
eat
unleavened
bread
as
i
commanded
thee
in
the
time
of
the
month
abib
for
in
the
month
abib
thou
camest
out
from
egypt
34
19
all
that
openeth
the
matrix
is
mine
and
every
firstling
among
thy
cattle
whether
ox
or
sheep
that
is
male
34
20
but
the
firstling
of
an
ass
thou
shalt
redeem
with
a
lamb
and
if
thou
redeem
him
not
then
shalt
thou
break
his
neck
all
the
firstborn
of
thy
sons
thou
shalt
redeem
and
none
shall
appear
before
me
empty
34
21
six
days
thou
shalt
work
but
on
the
seventh
day
thou
shalt
rest
in
earing
time
and
in

thou
shalt
rest
34
22
and
thou
shalt
observe

and
the
feast
of
ingathering
at
the
year’s
end
34
23
thrice
in
the
year
shall
all
your
menchildren
appear
before
the
lord
god
the
god
of
israel
34
24
for
i
will
cast
out
the
nations
before
thee
and
enlarge
thy
borders
neither
shall
any
man
desire
thy
land
when
thou
shalt
go
up
to
appear
before
the
lord
thy
god
thrice
in
the
year
34
25
thou
shalt
not
offer
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
with
leaven
neither
shall
the
sacrifice
of
the
feast
of
the
passover
be
left
unto
the
morning
34
26
the
first
of
the
firstfruits
of
thy
land
thou
shalt
bring
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
seethe
a
kid
in
his
mother’s
milk
34
27
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
write
thou
these
words
for
after
the
tenor
of
these
words
i
have
made
a
covenant
with
thee
and
with
israel
34
28
and
he
was
there
with
the
lord
forty
days
and
forty
nights
he
did
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
and
he
wrote
upon
the
tables
the
words
of
the
covenant
the
ten
commandments
34
29
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
came
down
from
mount
sinai
with
the
two
tables
of
testimony
in
moses’
hand
when
he
came
down
from
the
mount
that
moses
wist
not
that
the
skin
of
his
face
shone
while
he
talked
with
him
34
30
and
when
aaron
and
all
the
children
of
israel
saw
moses
behold
the
skin
of
his
face
shone
and
they
were
afraid
to
come
nigh
him
34
31
and
moses
called
unto
them
and
aaron
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
returned
unto
him
and
moses
talked
with
them
34
32
and
afterward
all
the
children
of
israel
came
nigh
and
he
gave
them
in
commandment
all
that
the
lord
had
spoken
with
him
in
mount
sinai
34
33
and
till
moses
had
done
speaking
with
them
he
put
a
vail
on
his
face
34
34
but
when
moses
went
in
before
the
lord
to
speak
with
him
he
took
the
vail
off
until
he
came
out
and
he
came
out
and
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
which
he
was
commanded
34
35
and
the
children
of
israel
saw
the
face
of
moses
that
the
skin
of
moses’
face
shone
and
moses
put
the
vail
upon
his
face
again
until
he
went
in
to
speak
with
him
35
1
and
moses
gathered
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
together
and
said
unto
them
these
are
the
words
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
that
ye
should
do
them
35
2
six

35
3
ye
shall
kindle
no

throughout
your
habitations
upon
the

day
35
4
and

spake
unto

the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel

is

offering
that

made

beside

10
13
and
ye

eat
it
in

place
because
it
is
thy
due
and
thy

due
of

made

with
thee
by
a

for

as
the

hath
commanded
10
16
and
moses
diligently
sought
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering
and
behold
it
was
burnt
and
he
was
angry
with

and
ithamar
the
sons
of

which

left
alive
saying
10
17
wherefore
have
ye
not
eaten
the
sin
offering
in

place
seeing

holy
and

given
it
you
to
bear
the
iniquity
of
the

to
make
atonement
for
them
before
the
lord
10
18
behold
the
blood
of

was
not
brought
in
within
the
holy
place
ye
should
indeed
have
eaten
it
in

holy
place
as
i
commanded
10
19

aaron
said
unto
moses
behold
this
day
have
they
offered
their
sin
offering
and
their
burnt
offering
before
the
lord
and
such
things
have
befallen
me
and
if
i
had
eaten
the
sin
offering
to
day
should
it
have
been
accepted
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
10
20
and
when
moses
heard
that
he
was
content
11

and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
to
aaron
saying
unto
them

to

and
thou
shalt
say
unto

and

there
be
of

that
eateth

of

that

among

there
be
of

that
sojourn
among
you
which
hunteth
and
catcheth
any

that
may
be
eaten
he
shall
even
pour
out
the

thereof
and
cover
it
with

17
14
for
it
is
the
life
of
all
flesh
the
blood
of
it
is
for
the
life
thereof
therefore
i
said
unto
the
children
of

ye
shall
eat
the
blood
of
no
manner
of

for
the
life
of

thereof
whosoever
eateth
it
shall
be
cut
off

that
eateth
that
which
died
of
itself
or
that
which
was
torn
with
beasts
whether
it
be
one
of

he
shall
both
wash

then
shall
he
be
clean

16
but
if
he
wash
them
not

her
increase
neither

26
21
and

contrary
unto
me
and

not
hearken
unto
me
i
will
bring
seven
times
more
plagues
upon
you
according

destroy
your
cattle
and
make
you
few
in
number
and

not
be
reformed
by

by
these
things
but

walk
contrary
unto
me
26
24
then
will
i
also
walk
contrary
unto
you
and
will
punish
you
yet
seven
times
for
your
sins
26
25
and
i
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you
that
shall
avenge
the
quarrel
of
my
covenant
and
when
ye
are
gathered
together
within
your
cities
i
will
send
the
pestilence
among
you
and
ye
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
26
26
and
when
i
have
broken
the
staff
of
your
bread
ten
women
shall
bake
your
bread
in
one
oven
and
they
shall
deliver
you
your
bread
again
by
weight
and
ye
shall
eat
and
not
be
satisfied
26
27
and

ye
will
not
for
all
this
hearken
unto
me
but
walk
contrary
unto
me
26
28
then
i
will
walk
contrary
unto
you
also
in
fury
and
i
even
i
will
chastise
you
seven
times
for
your
sins
26
29
and
ye
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
your
sons
and
the
flesh
of
your
daughters
shall
ye
eat
26
30
and
i
will
destroy
your
high
places
and
cut
down
your
images
and
cast
your
carcases
upon
the
carcases
of
your
idols
and
my
soul
shall
abhor
you
26
31
and
i
will
make
your
cities
waste
and
bring
your
sanctuaries
unto
desolation
and
i
will
not
smell
the
savour
of
your
sweet
odours
26
32
and
i
will
bring
the
land
into
desolation
and
your
enemies
which
dwell
therein
shall
be
astonished
at
it
26
33
and
i
will
scatter
you
among
the
heathen
and
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
you
and
your
land
shall
be
desolate
and
your
cities
waste
26
34
then
shall
the
land
enjoy
her
sabbaths
as
long
as
it
lieth
desolate
and
ye
be
in
your
enemies’
land
even
then
shall
the
land
rest
and
enjoy
her
sabbaths
26
35
as
long
as
it
lieth
desolate
it
shall
rest
because
it
did
not
rest
in
your
sabbaths
when
ye
dwelt
upon
it
26
36
and
upon
them
that
are
left
alive
of
you
i
will
send
a
faintness
into
their
hearts
in
the
lands
of
their
enemies
and
the
sound
of
a
shaken
leaf
shall
chase
them
and
they
shall
flee
as
fleeing
from
a
sword
and
they
shall
fall
when
none
pursueth
26
37
and
they
shall
fall
one
upon
another
as
it
were
before
a
sword
when
none
pursueth
and
ye
shall
have
no
power
to
stand
before
your
enemies
26
38
and
ye
shall
perish
among
the
heathen
and
the
land
of
your
enemies
shall
eat
you
up
26
39
and
they
that
are
left
of
you
shall
pine
away
in
their
iniquity
in
your
enemies’
lands
and
also
in
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
shall
they
pine
away
with
them
26
40
if
they
shall
confess
their
iniquity
and
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
with
their
trespass
which
they
trespassed
against
me
and
that
also
they
have
walked
contrary
unto
me
26
41
and
that
i
also
have
walked
contrary
unto
them
and
have
brought
them
into
the
land
of
their
enemies
if
then
their
uncircumcised
hearts
be
humbled
and
they
then
accept
of
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity
26
42
then
will
i
remember
my
covenant
with
jacob
and
also
my
covenant
with
isaac
and
also
my
covenant
with
abraham
will
i
remember
and
i
will
remember
the
land
26
43
the
land
also
shall
be
left
of
them
and
shall
enjoy
her
sabbaths
while
she
lieth
desolate
without
them
and
they
shall
accept
of
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity
because
even
because
they
despised
my
judgments
and
because
their
soul
abhorred
my
statutes
26
44
and
yet
for
all
that
when
they
be
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
i
will
not
cast
them
away
neither
will
i
abhor
them
to
destroy
them
utterly
and
to
break
my
covenant
with
them
for
i
am
the
lord
their
god
26
45
but
i
will
for
their
sakes
remember
the
covenant
of
their
ancestors
whom
i
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
that
i
might
be
their
god
i
am
the
lord
26
46
these
are
the
statutes
and
judgments
and
laws
which
the
lord
made
between
him
and
the
children
of
israel
in
mount
sinai
by
the
hand
of
moses
27

and
the

but
if

then
he
shall
present
himself
before
the
priest
and
the
priest
shall
value
him
according
to
his
ability
that
vowed
shall
the

value
him
27

and
if
it

whereof
men
bring
an
offering
unto
the

all

of
such
unto

he

a

to
rot
and
the
woman
shall
say
amen
amen
5
23
and
the
priest
shall
write
these
curses
in
a
book
and
he
shall
blot
them
out
with
the
bitter
water
5
24
and
he
shall
cause
the
woman
to
drink
the
bitter
water
that
causeth
the
curse
and
the
water
that
causeth
the
curse
shall
enter
into
her
and
become
bitter
5
25
then
the
priest
shall
take
the
jealousy
offering
out
of
the
woman’s
hand
and
shall
wave
the
offering
before
the
lord
and
offer
it
upon
the
altar
5
26
and
the

shall
take
an
handful
of
the
offering
even
the
memorial
thereof
and
burn
it
upon

and
afterward
shall
cause
the
woman
to
drink
the
water
5
27
and
when
he
hath
made
her
to
drink
the
water
then
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
if
she
be
defiled
and
have
done
trespass
against
her
husband
that
the
water
that
causeth
the
curse
shall
enter
into
her
and
become
bitter
and
her
belly
shall
swell
and
her
thigh
shall
rot
and
the
woman
shall
be
a
curse
among
her
people
5
28
and
if
the
woman
be
not
defiled
but
be
clean
then
she
shall
be
free
and
shall
conceive
seed
5
29
this
is
the
law
of
jealousies
when
a
wife
goeth
aside
to
another
instead
of
her
husband
and

defiled
5

who
were
defiled
by

that
they
could
not
keep

and
they
came

and
those
men
said
unto
him
we
are
defiled
by
the

wherefore

we
kept

we
may
not

will
command
concerning
you
9
9
and
the
lord
spake

saying
if
any
man
of

13
but
the
man
that

not
in
a
journey
and
forbeareth
to
keep
the
passover
even
the
same
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from

people
because
he
brought
not
the
offering
of

season
that
man

bear
his
sin
9
14

he
do
ye

have
one
ordinance
both
for
the
stranger
and
for
him
that

they
pitched

they

19
and
when

many
days
then
the
children
of

kept
the
charge
of
the

they

22
or

23
at

lord
by
the

10
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
10
2
make
thee
two
trumpets
of
silver
of
a
whole
piece
shalt
thou
make
them
that
thou
mayest
use
them
for
the
calling
of

assembly
and
for

journeying
of
the

10
3
and
when
they
shall
blow
with
them
all
the
assembly
shall
assemble
themselves
to
thee
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
10
4
and
if
they
blow
but
with
one
trumpet
then
the
princes
which
are
heads
of
the
thousands
of
israel
shall
gather
themselves
unto
thee
10
5
when
ye
blow
an
alarm
then
the
camps
that
lie
on
the
east
parts
shall
go
forward
10
6
when
ye
blow
an
alarm
the
second

then
the

that
lie
on
the
south
side
shall
take
their
journey
they
shall
blow
an
alarm
for

10
7
but
when
the
congregation
is
to
be
gathered
together
ye
shall
blow
but
ye
shall
not
sound
an
alarm
10
8
and
the
sons
of
aaron
the
priests
shall
blow
with
the
trumpets
and
they
shall
be
to
you
for
an
ordinance
for
ever
throughout
your
generations
10
9
and
if
ye
go
to
war
in
your
land
against
the
enemy
that
oppresseth
you
then
ye
shall
blow
an
alarm
with
the
trumpets
and
ye
shall
be
remembered
before
the
lord
your
god
and
ye
shall
be
saved
from
your
enemies
10
10
also
in
the
day
of
your
gladness
and
in
your
solemn
days
and
in
the
beginnings
of
your

10
29
and
moses
said
unto

the

moses’
father
in
law
we
are
journeying
unto

place
of

i
will
give
it
you
come
thou
with
us
and
we
will
do
thee
good
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
good
concerning

10
30
and

said
unto

i
will
not
go
but
i
will
depart
to

own
land
and
to

kindred
10
31

he
said
leave
us
not
i
pray
thee
forasmuch
as
thou
knowest
how
we
are
to
encamp
in
the
wilderness
and
thou
mayest
be
to
us
instead
of
eyes
10
32
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
go
with
us
yea
it
shall
be
that
what
goodness
the
lord
shall
do
unto
us
the
same
will
we
do
unto
thee
10
33
and
they
departed
from
the
mount
of
the
lord
three
days’
journey
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
went
before
them
in
the
three
days’
journey
to
search
out
a
resting
place
for
them
10
34
and
the
cloud
of
the
lord
was
upon
them
by
day
when
they
went
out
of
the
camp
10
35
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
ark
set
forward
that
moses
said
rise
up
lord
and
let
thine
enemies
be
scattered
and
let
them
that
hate
thee
flee
before
thee
10
36
and
when
it
rested
he
said
return
o
lord
unto
the
many
thousands
of
israel
11
1
and
when
the
people
complained
it
displeased
the
lord
and
the
lord
heard
it
and
his
anger
was
kindled
and
the
fire
of
the
lord
burnt
among
them
and
consumed
them
that
were
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
camp
11
2
and
the
people
cried
unto
moses
and
when
moses
prayed
unto
the
lord
the
fire
was
quenched
11
3
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
taberah
because
the
fire
of
the
lord
burnt
among
them
11
4
and
the
mixt
multitude
that
was
among
them
fell
a
lusting
and
the
children
of
israel
also
wept
again
and
said
who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat
11
5
we
remember
the
fish
which
we
did
eat
in
egypt
freely
the
cucumbers
and
the
melons
and
the
leeks
and
the
onions
and
the
garlick
11
6
but
now
our
soul
is
dried
away
there
is
nothing
at
all
beside
this
manna
before
our
eyes
11
7
and
the
manna
was
as
coriander
seed
and
the
colour
thereof
as
the
colour
of
bdellium
11
8
and
the
people
went
about
and
gathered
it
and
ground
it
in
mills
or
beat
it
in
a
mortar
and
baked
it
in
pans
and
made
cakes
of
it
and
the
taste
of
it
was
as
the
taste
of
fresh
oil
11
9
and
when
the
dew
fell
upon
the
camp
in
the
night
the
manna
fell
upon
it
11
10
then
moses
heard
the
people
weep
throughout
their
families
every
man
in
the
door
of
his
tent
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
greatly
moses
also
was
displeased
11
11
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
wherefore
hast
thou
afflicted
thy
servant
and
wherefore
have
i
not
found
favour
in
thy
sight
that
thou
layest
the
burden
of
all
this
people
upon
me
11
12
have
i
conceived
all
this
people
have
i
begotten
them
that
thou
shouldest
say
unto
me
carry
them
in
thy
bosom
as
a
nursing
father
beareth
the
sucking
child
unto
the
land
which
thou
swarest
unto
their
fathers
11
13
whence
should
i
have
flesh
to
give
unto
all
this
people
for
they
weep
unto
me
saying
give
us
flesh
that
we
may
eat
11
14
i
am
not
able
to
bear
all
this
people
alone
because
it
is
too
heavy
for
me
11
15
and
if
thou
deal
thus
with
me
kill
me
i
pray
thee
out
of
hand
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
and
let
me
not
see
my
wretchedness
11
16
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
gather
unto
me
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
israel
whom
thou
knowest
to
be
the
elders
of
the
people
and
officers
over
them
and
bring
them
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
that
they
may
stand
there
with
thee
11
17
and
i
will
come
down
and
talk
with
thee
there
and
i
will
take
of
the
spirit
which
is
upon
thee
and
will
put
it
upon
them
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
of
the
people
with
thee
that
thou
bear
it
not
thyself
alone
11
18
and
say
thou
unto
the
people
sanctify
yourselves
against
to
morrow
and
ye
shall
eat
flesh
for
ye
have
wept
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
saying
who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat
for
it
was
well
with
us
in
egypt
therefore
the
lord
will
give
you
flesh
and
ye
shall
eat
11
19
ye
shall
not
eat
one
day
nor
two
days
nor
five
days
neither
ten
days
nor
twenty
days
11
20
but
even
a
whole
month
until
it
come
out
at
your
nostrils
and
it
be
loathsome
unto
you
because
that
ye
have
despised
the
lord
which
is
among
you
and
have
wept
before
him
saying
why
came
we
forth
out
of
egypt
11
21
and
moses
said
the
people
among
whom
i
am
are
six
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
thou
hast
said
i
will
give
them
flesh
that
they
may
eat
a
whole
month
11
22
shall
the
flocks
and
the
herds
be
slain
for
them
to
suffice
them
or
shall
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
be
gathered
together
for
them
to
suffice
them
11
23
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
is
the
lord’s
hand
waxed
short
thou
shalt
see
now
whether
my
word
shall
come
to
pass
unto
thee
or
not
11
24
and
moses
went
out
and
told
the
people
the
words
of
the
lord
and
gathered
the
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
the
people
and
set
them
round
about
the
tabernacle
11
25
and
the
lord
came
down
in
a
cloud
and
spake
unto
him
and
took
of
the
spirit
that
was
upon
him
and
gave
it
unto
the
seventy
elders
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
spirit
rested
upon
them
they
prophesied
and
did
not
cease
11
26
but
there
remained
two
of
the
men
in
the
camp
the
name
of
the
one
was
eldad
and
the
name
of
the
other
medad
and
the
spirit
rested
upon
them
and
they
were
of
them
that
were
written
but
went
not
out
unto
the
tabernacle
and
they
prophesied
in
the
camp
11
27
and
there
ran
a
young
man
and
told
moses
and
said
eldad
and
medad
do
prophesy
in
the
camp
11
28
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
moses
one
of
his
young
men
answered
and
said
my
lord
moses
forbid
them
11
29
and
moses
said
unto
him
enviest
thou
for
my
sake
would
god
that
all
the
lord’s
people
were
prophets
and
that
the
lord
would
put
his
spirit
upon
them
11
30
and
moses
gat
him
into
the
camp
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
11
31
and
there
went
forth
a
wind
from
the
lord
and
brought
quails
from
the
sea
and
let
them
fall
by
the
camp
as
it
were
a
day’s
journey
on
this
side
and
as
it
were
a
day’s
journey
on
the
other
side
round
about
the
camp
and
as
it
were
two
cubits
high
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
11
32
and
the
people
stood
up
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
and
they
gathered
the
quails
he
that
gathered
least
gathered
ten
homers
and
they
spread
them
all
abroad
for
themselves
round
about
the
camp
11
33
and
while
the
flesh
was
yet
between
their
teeth
ere
it
was
chewed
the
wrath
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
the
people
and
the
lord
smote
the
people
with
a
very
great
plague
11
34
and
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
kibrothhattaavah
because
there
they
buried
the
people
that
lusted
11
35
and
the
people
journeyed
from
kibrothhattaavah
unto
hazeroth
and
abode
at
hazeroth
12
1
and
miriam
and
aaron
spake
against
moses
because
of
the
ethiopian
woman
whom
he
had
married
for
he
had
married
an
ethiopian
woman
12
2
and
they
said
hath
the
lord
indeed
spoken
only
by
moses
hath
he
not
spoken
also
by
us
and
the
lord
heard
it
12
3
(now
the
man
moses
was
very
meek
above
all
the
men
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
)
12
4
and
the
lord
spake
suddenly
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
and
unto
miriam
come
out
ye
three
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
three
came
out
12
5
and
the
lord
came
down
in
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
and
called
aaron
and
miriam
and
they
both
came
forth
12
6
and
he
said
hear
now
my
words
if
there
be
a
prophet
among
you
i
the
lord
will
make
myself
known
unto
him
in
a
vision
and
will
speak
unto
him
in
a
dream
12
7
my
servant
moses
is
not
so
who
is
faithful
in
all
mine
house
12
8
with
him
will
i
speak
mouth
to
mouth
even
apparently
and
not
in
dark
speeches
and
the
similitude
of
the
lord
shall
he
behold
wherefore
then
were
ye
not
afraid
to
speak
against
my
servant
moses
12
9
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
them
and
he
departed
12
10
and
the
cloud
departed
from
off
the
tabernacle
and
behold
miriam
became
leprous
white
as
snow
and
aaron
looked
upon
miriam
and
behold
she
was
leprous
12
11
and
aaron
said
unto
moses
alas
my
lord
i
beseech
thee
lay
not
the
sin
upon
us
wherein
we
have
done
foolishly
and
wherein
we
have
sinned
12
12
let
her
not
be
as
one
dead
of
whom
the
flesh
is
half
consumed
when
he
cometh
out
of
his
mother’s
womb
12
13
and
moses
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
heal
her
now
o
god
i
beseech
thee
12
14
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
if
her
father
had
but
spit
in
her
face
should
she
not
be
ashamed
seven
days
let
her
be
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days
and
after
that
let
her
be
received
in
again
12
15
and
miriam
was
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days
and
the
people
journeyed
not
till
miriam
was
brought
in
again
12
16
and
afterward
the
people
removed
from
hazeroth
and
pitched
in
the
wilderness
of
paran
13
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
13
2
send
thou
men
that
they
may
search
the
land
of
canaan
which
i
give
unto
the
children
of
israel
of
every
tribe
of
their
fathers
shall
ye
send
a
man
every
one
a
ruler
among
them
13
3
and
moses
by
the
commandment
of
the
lord
sent
them
from
the
wilderness
of
paran
all
those
men
were
heads
of
the

16
these
are
the
names
of
the
men
which
moses
sent
to
spy
out
the
land
and
moses
called
oshea
the
son
of
nun
jehoshua
13
17
and
moses
sent
them
to
spy
out
the
land
of
canaan
and
said
unto
them
get
you
up
this
way
southward
and
go
up
into
the
mountain
13
18
and
see
the
land
what
it
is
and
the
people
that
dwelleth
therein
whether
they
be
strong
or
weak
few
or
many
13
19
and
what
the
land
is
that
they
dwell
in
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
and
what
cities
they
be
that
they
dwell
in
whether
in
tents
or
in
strong
holds
13
20
and
what
the
land
is
whether
it
be
fat
or
lean
whether
there
be
wood
therein
or
not
and
be
ye
of
good
courage
and
bring
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
now
the
time
was
the
time
of
the
firstripe
grapes
13
21
so
they
went
up
and
searched
the
land
from
the
wilderness
of
zin
unto
rehob
as
men
come
to
hamath
13
22
and
they
ascended
by
the
south
and
came
unto
hebron
where
ahiman
sheshai
and
talmai
the
children
of
anak
were
(now
hebron
was
built
seven
years
before
zoan
in
egypt
)
13
23
and
they
came
unto
the
brook
of
eshcol
and
cut
down
from
thence
a
branch
with
one
cluster
of
grapes
and
they
bare
it
between
two
upon
a
staff
and
they
brought
of
the
pomegranates
and
of
the
figs
13
24
the
place
was
called
the
brook
eshcol
because
of
the
cluster
of
grapes
which
the
children
of
israel
cut
down
from
thence
13
25
and
they
returned
from
searching
of
the
land
after
forty
days
13
26
and
they
went
and
came
to
moses
and
to
aaron
and
to
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
unto
the
wilderness
of
paran
to
kadesh
and
brought
back
word
unto
them
and
unto
all
the
congregation
and
shewed
them
the
fruit
of
the
land
13
27
and
they
told
him
and
said
we
came
unto
the
land
whither
thou
sentest
us
and
surely
it
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
this
is
the
fruit
of
it
13
28
nevertheless
the
people
be
strong
that
dwell
in
the
land
and
the
cities
are
walled
and
very
great
and
moreover
we
saw
the
children
of
anak
there
13
29
the
amalekites
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
south
and
the
hittites
and
the
jebusites
and
the
amorites
dwell
in
the
mountains
and
the
canaanites
dwell
by
the
sea
and
by
the
coast
of
jordan
13
30
and
caleb
stilled
the
people
before
moses
and
said
let
us
go
up
at
once
and
possess
it
for
we
are
well
able
to
overcome
it
13
31
but
the
men
that
went
up
with
him
said
we
be
not
able
to
go
up
against
the
people
for
they
are
stronger
than
we
13
32
and
they
brought
up
an
evil
report
of
the
land
which
they
had
searched
unto
the
children
of
israel
saying
the
land
through
which
we
have
gone
to
search
it
is
a
land
that
eateth
up
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
all
the
people
that
we
saw
in
it
are
men
of
a
great
stature
13
33
and
there
we
saw
the
giants
the
sons
of
anak
which
come
of
the
giants
and
we
were
in
our
own
sight
as
grasshoppers
and
so
we
were
in
their
sight
14
1
and
all
the
congregation
lifted
up
their
voice
and
cried
and
the
people
wept
that
night
14
2
and
all
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
against
aaron
and
the
whole
congregation
said
unto
them
would
god
that
we
had
died
in
the
land
of
egypt
or
would
god
we
had
died
in
this
wilderness
14
3
and
wherefore
hath
the
lord
brought
us
unto
this
land
to
fall
by
the
sword
that
our
wives
and
our
children
should
be
a
prey
were
it
not
better
for
us
to
return
into
egypt
14
4
and
they
said
one
to
another
let
us
make
a
captain
and
let
us
return
into
egypt
14
5
then
moses
and
aaron
fell
on
their
faces
before
all
the
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
14
6
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
which
were
of
them
that
searched
the
land
rent
their
clothes
14
7
and
they
spake
unto
all
the
company
of
the
children
of
israel
saying
the
land
which
we
passed
through
to
search
it
is
an
exceeding
good
land
14
8
if
the
lord
delight
in
us
then
he
will
bring
us
into
this
land
and
give
it
us
a
land
which
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
14
9
only
rebel
not
ye
against
the
lord
neither
fear
ye
the
people
of
the
land
for
they
are
bread
for
us
their
defence
is
departed
from
them
and
the
lord
is
with
us
fear
them
not
14
10
but
all
the
congregation
bade
stone
them
with
stones
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
all
the
children
of
israel
14
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
how
long
will
this
people
provoke
me
and
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
believe
me
for
all
the
signs
which
i
have
shewed
among
them
14
12
i
will
smite
them
with
the
pestilence
and
disinherit
them
and
will
make
of
thee
a
greater
nation
and
mightier
than
they
14
13
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
then
the
egyptians
shall
hear
it
(for
thou
broughtest
up
this
people
in
thy
might
from
among
them
)
14
14
and
they
will
tell
it
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
for
they
have
heard
that
thou
lord
art
among
this
people
that
thou
lord
art
seen
face
to
face
and
that
thy
cloud
standeth
over
them
and
that
thou
goest
before
them
by
day
time
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud
and
in
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
14
15
now
if
thou
shalt
kill
all
this
people
as
one
man
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
of
thee
will
speak
saying
14
16
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
them
therefore
he
hath
slain
them
in
the
wilderness
14
17
and
now
i
beseech
thee
let
the
power
of
my
lord
be
great
according
as
thou
hast
spoken
saying
14
18
the
lord
is
longsuffering
and
of
great
mercy
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
by
no
means
clearing
the
guilty
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
14
19
pardon
i
beseech
thee
the
iniquity
of
this
people
according
unto
the
greatness
of
thy
mercy
and
as
thou
hast
forgiven
this
people
from
egypt
even
until
now
14
20
and
the
lord
said
i
have
pardoned
according
to
thy
word
14
21
but
as
truly
as
i
live
all
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
lord
14
22
because
all
those
men
which
have
seen
my
glory
and
my
miracles
which
i
did
in
egypt
and
in
the
wilderness
and
have
tempted
me
now
these
ten
times
and
have
not
hearkened
to
my
voice
14
23
surely
they
shall
not
see
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
neither
shall
any
of
them
that
provoked
me
see
it
14
24
but
my
servant
caleb
because
he
had
another
spirit
with
him
and
hath
followed
me
fully
him
will
i
bring
into
the
land
whereinto
he
went
and
his
seed
shall
possess
it
14
25
(now
the
amalekites
and
the
canaanites
dwelt
in
the
valley
)
tomorrow
turn
you
and
get
you
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
14
26
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
14
27
how
long
shall
i
bear
with
this
evil
congregation
which
murmur
against
me
i
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
israel
which
they
murmur
against
me
14
28
say
unto
them
as
truly
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
as
ye
have
spoken
in
mine
ears
so
will
i
do
to
you
14
29
your
carcases
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness
and
all
that
were
numbered
of
you
according
to
your
whole
number
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
which
have
murmured
against
me
14
30
doubtless
ye
shall
not
come
into
the
land
concerning
which
i
sware
to
make
you
dwell
therein
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
14
31
but
your
little
ones
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey
them
will
i
bring
in
and
they
shall
know
the
land
which
ye
have
despised
14
32
but
as
for
you
your
carcases
they
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness
14
33
and
your
children
shall
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
and
bear
your
whoredoms
until
your
carcases
be
wasted
in
the
wilderness
14
34
after
the
number
of
the
days
in
which
ye
searched
the
land
even
forty
days
each
day
for
a
year
shall
ye
bear
your
iniquities
even
forty
years
and
ye
shall
know
my
breach
of
promise
14
35
i
the
lord
have
said
i
will
surely
do
it
unto
all
this
evil
congregation
that
are
gathered
together
against
me
in
this
wilderness
they
shall
be
consumed
and
there
they
shall
die
14
36
and
the
men
which
moses
sent
to
search
the
land
who
returned
and
made
all
the
congregation
to
murmur
against
him
by
bringing
up
a
slander
upon
the
land
14
37
even
those
men
that
did
bring
up
the
evil
report
upon
the
land
died
by
the
plague
before
the
lord
14
38
but
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
which
were
of
the
men
that
went
to
search
the
land
lived
still
14
39
and
moses
told
these
sayings
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
the
people
mourned
greatly
14
40
and
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
gat
them
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
saying
lo
we
be
here
and
will
go
up
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
hath
promised
for
we
have
sinned
14
41
and
moses
said
wherefore
now
do
ye
transgress
the
commandment
of
the
lord
but
it
shall
not
prosper
14
42
go
not
up
for
the
lord
is
not
among
you
that
ye
be
not
smitten
before
your
enemies
14
43
for
the
amalekites
and
the
canaanites
are
there
before
you
and
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword
because
ye
are
turned
away
from
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
will
not
be
with
you
14
44
but
they
presumed
to
go
up
unto
the
hill
top
nevertheless
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
moses
departed
not
out
of
the
camp
14
45
then
the
amalekites
came
down
and
the
canaanites
which
dwelt
in
that
hill
and
smote
them
and
discomfited
them
even
unto
hormah
15
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
15
2
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
be
come
into
the
land
of
your
habitations
which
i
give
unto
you
15
3
and
will
make
an
offering
by
fire
unto
the
lord
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow
or
in
a
freewill
offering
or
in
your
solemn
feasts
to
make
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
of
the
herd
or
of
the
flock
15
4
then
shall
he
that
offereth
his
offering
unto
the
lord
bring
a
meat
offering
of
a
tenth
deal
of
flour
mingled
with
the

of
an

15
5
and
the
fourth
part
of
an
hin
of

for
a

offering
shalt
thou
prepare
with
the
burnt

or

for
one
lamb
15
6
or
for
a
ram
thou
shalt
prepare
for
a

offering
two
tenth
deals
of
flour
mingled
with
the
third
part
of
an
hin
of

15
7
and
for
a

offering
thou
shalt
offer
the
third
part
of
an
hin
of
wine
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
15
8
and
when
thou
preparest
a
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering
or
for
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow
or
peace
offerings
unto
the
lord
15
9
then
shall
he
bring
with
a
bullock
a
meat
offering
of
three
tenth
deals
of
flour
mingled
with
half
an
hin
of

15
10
and
thou
shalt
bring
for

offering
half
an
hin
of
wine
for
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
15
11
thus
shall
it
be
done
for
one
bullock
or
for
one
ram
or
for
a
lamb
or
a
kid
15
12
according
to
the
number
that
ye
shall
prepare
so
shall
ye
do
to
every
one
according
to
their
number
15
13
all
that
are
born
of
the
country
shall
do
these
things
after
this
manner
in
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
15
14
and
if
a
stranger
sojourn
with
you
or
whosoever
be
among
you
in
your
generations
and
will
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
as
ye
do
so
he
shall
do
15
15
one
ordinance
shall
be
both
for
you
of
the
congregation
and
also
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you
an
ordinance
for
ever
in
your
generations
as
ye
are
so
shall
the
stranger
be
before
the
lord
15
16
one
law
and
one
manner
shall
be
for
you
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you
15
17
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
15
18
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
come
into
the
land
whither
i
bring
you
15
19
then
it
shall
be
that
when
ye
eat
of
the
bread
of
the
land
ye
shall
offer
up
an
heave
offering
unto
the
lord
15
20
ye
shall
offer
up
a
cake
of
the
first
of
your
dough
for
an
heave
offering
as
ye
do
the
heave
offering
of
the
threshingfloor
so
shall
ye
heave
it
15
21
of
the
first
of
your
dough
ye
shall
give
unto
the
lord
an
heave
offering
in
your
generations
15
22
and
if
ye
have
erred
and
not
observed
all
these
commandments
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
unto
moses
15
23
even
all
that
the
lord
hath
commanded
you
by
the
hand
of
moses
from
the
day
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
henceforward
among
your
generations
15
24
then
it
shall
be
if
ought
be
committed
by
ignorance
without
the
knowledge
of
the
congregation
that
all
the
congregation
shall
offer
one
young
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
with
his
meat
offering
and
his
drink
offering
according
to
the
manner
and
one
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering
15
25
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
them
for
it
is
ignorance
and
they
shall
bring
their
offering
a
sacrifice
made
by
fire
unto
the
lord
and
their
sin
offering
before
the
lord
for
their
ignorance
15
26
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
and
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them
seeing
all
the
people
were
in
ignorance
15
27
and
if
any
soul
sin
through
ignorance
then
he
shall
bring
a
she
goat
of
the
first
year
for
a
sin
offering
15
28
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
soul
that
sinneth
ignorantly
when
he
sinneth
by
ignorance
before
the
lord
to
make
an
atonement
for
him
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
15
29
ye
shall
have
one
law
for
him
that
sinneth
through
ignorance
both
for
him
that
is
born
among
the
children
of
israel
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them
15
30
but
the
soul
that
doeth
ought
presumptuously
whether
he
be
born
in
the
land
or
a
stranger
the
same
reproacheth
the
lord
and
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
15
31
because
he
hath
despised
the
word
of
the
lord
and
hath
broken
his
commandment
that
soul
shall
utterly
be
cut
off
his
iniquity
shall
be
upon
him
15
32
and
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness
they
found
a
man
that
gathered
sticks
upon
the
sabbath
day
15
33
and
they
that
found
him
gathering
sticks
brought
him
unto
moses
and
aaron
and
unto
all
the
congregation
15
34
and
they
put
him
in
ward
because
it
was
not
declared
what
should
be
done
to
him
15
35
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
all
the
congregation
shall
stone
him
with
stones
without
the
camp
15
36
and
all
the
congregation
brought
him
without
the
camp
and
stoned
him
with
stones
and
he
died
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
15
37
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
15
38
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
bid
them
that
they
make
them
fringes
in
the
borders
of
their
garments
throughout
their
generations
and
that
they
put
upon
the
fringe
of
the
borders
a
ribband
of
blue
15
39
and
it
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
fringe
that
ye
may
look
upon
it
and
remember
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
do
them
and
that
ye
seek
not
after
your
own
heart
and
your
own
eyes
after
which
ye
use
to
go
a
whoring
15
40
that
ye
may
remember
and
do
all
my
commandments
and
be
holy
unto
your
god
15
41
i
am
the
lord
your
god
which
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
to
be
your
god
i
am
the

now
korah
the
son
of
izhar
the
son
of
kohath
the
son
of
levi
and
dathan
and
abiram
the
sons
of
eliab
and
on
the
son
of
peleth
sons
of
reuben
took
men
16
2
and
they
rose
up
before
moses
with
certain
of
the
children
of
israel
two
hundred
and
fifty
princes
of
the
assembly
famous
in
the
congregation
men
of
renown
16
3
and
they
gathered
themselves
together
against
moses
and
against
aaron
and
said
unto
them
ye
take
too
much
upon
you
seeing
all
the
congregation
are
holy
every
one
of
them
and
the
lord
is
among
them
wherefore
then
lift
ye
up
yourselves
above
the
congregation
of
the
lord
16
4
and
when
moses
heard
it
he
fell
upon
his
face
16
5
and
he
spake
unto
korah
and
unto
all
his
company
saying
even
to
morrow
the
lord
will
shew
who
are
his
and
who
is
holy
and
will
cause
him
to
come
near
unto
him
even
him
whom
he
hath
chosen
will
he
cause
to
come
near
unto
him
16
6
this
do
take
you
censers
korah
and
all
his
company
16
7
and
put
fire
therein
and
put
incense
in
them
before
the
lord
to
morrow
and
it
shall
be
that
the
man
whom
the
lord
doth
choose
he
shall
be
holy
ye
take
too
much
upon
you
ye
sons
of
levi
16
8
and
moses
said
unto
korah
hear
i
pray
you
ye
sons
of
levi
16
9
seemeth
it
but
a
small
thing
unto
you
that
the
god
of
israel
hath
separated
you
from
the
congregation
of
israel
to
bring
you
near
to
himself
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
to
stand
before
the
congregation
to
minister
unto
them
16
10
and
he
hath
brought
thee
near
to
him
and
all
thy
brethren
the
sons
of
levi
with
thee
and
seek
ye
the
priesthood
also
16
11
for
which
cause
both
thou
and
all
thy
company
are
gathered
together
against
the
lord
and
what
is
aaron
that
ye
murmur
against
him
16
12
and
moses
sent
to
call
dathan
and
abiram
the
sons
of
eliab
which
said
we
will
not
come
up
16
13
is
it
a
small
thing
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
to
kill
us
in
the
wilderness
except
thou
make
thyself
altogether
a
prince
over
us
16
14
moreover
thou
hast
not
brought
us
into
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
or
given
us
inheritance
of
fields
and
vineyards
wilt
thou
put
out
the
eyes
of
these
men
we
will
not
come
up
16
15
and
moses
was
very
wroth
and
said
unto
the
lord
respect
not
thou
their
offering
i
have
not
taken
one
ass
from
them
neither
have
i
hurt
one
of
them
16
16
and
moses
said
unto
korah
be
thou
and
all
thy
company
before
the
lord
thou
and
they
and
aaron
to
morrow
16
17
and
take
every
man
his
censer
and
put
incense
in
them
and
bring
ye
before
the
lord
every
man
his
censer
two
hundred
and
fifty
censers
thou
also
and
aaron
each
of
you
his
censer
16
18
and
they
took
every
man
his
censer
and
put
fire
in
them
and
laid
incense
thereon
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
with
moses
and
aaron
16
19
and
korah
gathered
all
the
congregation
against
them
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
all
the
congregation
16
20
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
16
21
separate
yourselves
from
among
this
congregation
that
i
may
consume
them
in
a
moment
16
22
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
said
o
god
the
god
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh
shall
one
man
sin
and
wilt
thou
be
wroth
with
all
the
congregation
16
23
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
16
24
speak
unto
the
congregation
saying
get
you
up
from
about
the
tabernacle
of
korah
dathan
and
abiram
16
25
and
moses
rose
up
and
went
unto
dathan
and
abiram
and
the
elders
of
israel
followed
him
16
26
and
he
spake
unto
the
congregation
saying
depart
i
pray
you
from
the
tents
of
these
wicked
men
and
touch
nothing
of
theirs
lest
ye
be
consumed
in
all
their
sins
16
27
so
they
gat
up
from
the
tabernacle
of
korah
dathan
and
abiram
on
every
side
and
dathan
and
abiram
came
out
and
stood
in
the
door
of
their
tents
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
little
children
16
28
and
moses
said
hereby
ye
shall
know
that
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
do
all
these
works
for
i
have
not
done
them
of
mine
own
mind
16
29
if
these
men
die
the
common
death
of
all
men
or
if
they
be
visited
after
the
visitation
of
all
men
then
the
lord
hath
not
sent
me
16
30
but
if
the
lord
make
a
new
thing
and
the
earth
open
her
mouth
and
swallow
them
up
with
all
that
appertain
unto
them
and
they
go
down
quick
into
the
pit
then
ye
shall
understand
that
these
men
have
provoked
the
lord
16
31
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words
that
the
ground
clave
asunder
that
was
under
them
16
32
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
them
up
and
their
houses
and
all
the
men
that
appertained
unto
korah
and
all
their
goods
16
33
they
and
all
that
appertained
to
them
went
down
alive
into
the
pit
and
the
earth
closed
upon
them
and
they
perished
from
among
the
congregation
16
34
and
all
israel
that
were
round
about
them
fled
at
the
cry
of
them
for
they
said
lest
the
earth
swallow
us
up
also
16
35
and
there
came
out
a
fire
from
the
lord
and
consumed
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
that
offered
incense
16
36
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
16
37
speak
unto
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
the
priest
that
he
take
up
the
censers
out
of
the
burning
and
scatter
thou
the
fire
yonder
for
they
are
hallowed
16
38
the
censers
of
these
sinners
against
their
own
souls
let
them
make
them
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar
for
they
offered
them
before
the
lord
therefore
they
are
hallowed
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
unto
the
children
of
israel
16
39
and
eleazar
the
priest
took
the
brasen
censers
wherewith
they
that
were
burnt
had
offered
and
they
were
made
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar
16
40
to
be
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
no
stranger
which
is
not
of
the
seed
of
aaron
come
near
to
offer
incense
before
the
lord
that
he
be
not
as
korah
and
as
his
company
as
the
lord
said
to
him
by
the
hand
of
moses
16
41
but
on
the
morrow
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
against
aaron
saying
ye
have
killed
the
people
of
the
lord
16
42
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
congregation
was
gathered
against
moses
and
against
aaron
that
they
looked
toward
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
behold
the
cloud
covered
it
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
16
43
and
moses
and
aaron
came
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
16
44
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
16
45
get
you
up
from
among
this
congregation
that
i
may
consume
them
as
in
a
moment
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
16
46
and
moses
said
unto
aaron
take
a
censer
and
put
fire
therein
from
off
the
altar
and
put
on
incense
and
go
quickly
unto
the
congregation
and
make
an
atonement
for
them
for
there
is
wrath
gone
out
from
the
lord
the
plague
is
begun
16
47
and
aaron
took
as
moses
commanded
and
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
behold
the
plague
was
begun
among
the
people
and
he
put
on
incense
and
made
an
atonement
for
the
people
16
48
and
he
stood
between
the
dead
and
the
living
and
the
plague
was
stayed
16
49
now
they
that
died
in
the
plague
were
fourteen
thousand
and
seven
hundred
beside
them
that
died
about
the
matter
of
korah
16
50
and
aaron
returned
unto
moses
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
plague
was
stayed
17
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
17
2
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
take
of
every
one
of
them
a
rod
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
of
all
their
princes
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
twelve
rods
write
thou
every
man’s
name
upon
his
rod
17
3
and
thou
shalt
write
aaron’s
name
upon
the
rod
of
levi
for
one
rod
shall
be
for
the
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
17
4
and
thou
shalt
lay
them
up
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
testimony
where
i
will
meet
with
you
17
5
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
man’s
rod
whom
i
shall
choose
shall
blossom
and
i
will
make
to
cease
from
me
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
israel
whereby
they
murmur
against
you
17
6
and
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
every
one
of
their
princes
gave
him
a
rod
apiece
for
each
prince
one
according
to
their
fathers’
houses
even
twelve
rods
and
the
rod
of
aaron
was
among
their
rods
17
7
and
moses
laid
up
the
rods
before
the
lord
in
the
tabernacle
of
witness
17
8
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
moses
went
into
the
tabernacle
of
witness
and
behold
the
rod
of
aaron
for
the
house
of
levi
was
budded
and
brought
forth
buds
and
bloomed
blossoms
and
yielded
almonds
17
9
and
moses
brought
out
all
the
rods
from
before
the
lord
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
they
looked
and
took
every
man
his
rod
17
10
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
bring
aaron’s
rod
again
before
the
testimony
to
be
kept
for
a
token
against
the
rebels
and
thou
shalt
quite
take
away
their
murmurings
from
me
that
they
die
not
17
11
and
moses
did
so
as
the
lord
commanded
him
so
did
he
17
12
and
the
children
of
israel
spake
unto
moses
saying
behold
we
die
we
perish
we
all
perish
17
13
whosoever
cometh
any
thing
near
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
shall
die
shall
we
be
consumed
with
dying
18
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
aaron
thou
and
thy
sons
and
thy
father’s
house
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
sanctuary
and
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
your
priesthood
18
2
and
thy
brethren
also
of
the
tribe
of
levi
the
tribe
of
thy
father
bring
thou
with
thee
that
they
may
be
joined
unto
thee
and
minister
unto
thee
but
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
minister
before
the
tabernacle
of
witness
18
3
and
they
shall
keep
thy
charge
and
the
charge
of
all
the
tabernacle
only
they
shall
not
come
nigh
the
vessels
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
altar
that
neither
they
nor
ye
also
die
18
4
and
they
shall
be
joined
unto
thee
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
for
all
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
and
a
stranger
shall
not
come
nigh
unto
you
18
5
and
ye
shall
keep
the
charge
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
charge
of
the
altar
that
there
be
no
wrath
any
more
upon
the
children
of
israel
18
6
and
i
behold
i
have
taken
your
brethren
the
levites
from
among
the
children
of
israel
to
you
they
are
given
as
a
gift
for
the
lord
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
18
7
therefore
thou
and
thy
sons

all

for

before
the

unto
thee
and
to
thy

with
thee
18
20
and
the
lord
spake
unto
aaron
thou
shalt
have
no
inheritance
in
their
land
neither
shalt
thou
have
any
part
among
them
i
am
thy
part
and
thine
inheritance
among
the
children
of
israel
18
21
and
behold
i
have
given
the
children
of
levi
all
the
tenth
in
israel
for
an
inheritance
for
their
service
which
they
serve
even
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
18
22
neither
must
the
children
of
israel
henceforth
come
nigh
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
lest
they
bear
sin
and
die
18
23
but
the
levites
shall
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations
that
among
the
children
of
israel
they
have
no
inheritance
18
24
but
the
tithes
of
the
children
of
israel
which
they
offer
as
an
heave
offering
unto
the
lord
i
have
given
to
the
levites
to
inherit
therefore
i
have
said
unto
them
among
the
children
of
israel
they
shall
have
no
inheritance
18
25
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
18
26
thus
speak
unto
the
levites
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
take
of
the
children
of
israel
the
tithes
which
i
have
given
you
from
them
for
your
inheritance
then
ye
shall
offer
up
an
heave
offering
of
it
for
the
lord
even
a
tenth
part
of
the
tithe
18
27
and
this
your
heave
offering
shall
be
reckoned
unto
you
as
though
it
were
the
corn
of
the
threshingfloor
and
as
the
fulness
of
the
winepress
18
28
thus
ye
also
shall
offer
an
heave
offering
unto
the
lord
of
all
your
tithes
which
ye
receive
of
the
children
of
israel
and
ye
shall
give
thereof
the
lord’s
heave
offering
to
aaron
the
priest
18
29
out
of
all
your
gifts
ye
shall
offer
every
heave
offering
of
the
lord
of
all
the
best
thereof
even
the
hallowed
part
thereof
out
of
it
18
30
therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
when
ye
have
heaved
the
best
thereof
from
it
then
it
shall
be
counted
unto
the
levites
as
the
increase
of
the
threshingfloor
and
as
the
increase
of
the
winepress
18
31
and
ye
shall
eat
it
in
every
place
ye
and
your
households
for
it
is
your
reward
for
your
service
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
18
32
and
ye
shall
bear
no
sin
by
reason
of
it
when
ye
have
heaved
from
it
the
best
of
it
neither
shall
ye
pollute
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
israel
lest
ye
die
19
1
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
19
2
this
is
the
ordinance
of
the
law
which
the
lord
hath
commanded

he
burn

even
the
whole
congregation
into
the
desert
of
zin
in
the
first
month
and
the
people
abode
in
kadesh
and
miriam
died
there
and
was
buried
there
20
2
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
congregation
and
they
gathered
themselves
together
against
moses
and
against
aaron
20
3
and
the
people
chode
with
moses
and
spake
saying
would
god
that
we
had
died
when
our
brethren
died
before
the
lord
20
4
and
why
have
ye
brought
up
the
congregation
of
the
lord
into
this
wilderness
that
we
and
our
cattle
should
die
there
20
5
and
wherefore
have
ye
made
us
to
come
up
out
of
egypt
to
bring
us
in
unto
this
evil
place
it
is
no
place
of
seed
or
of
figs
or
of
vines
or
of
pomegranates
neither
is
there
any
water
to
drink
20
6
and
moses
and
aaron
went
from
the
presence
of
the
assembly
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
them
20
7
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
20
8
take
the
rod
and
gather
thou
the
assembly
together
thou
and
aaron
thy
brother
and
speak
ye
unto
the
rock
before
their
eyes
and
it
shall
give
forth
his
water
and
thou
shalt
bring
forth
to
them
water
out
of
the
rock
so
thou
shalt
give
the
congregation
and
their
beasts
drink
20
9
and
moses
took
the
rod
from
before
the
lord
as
he
commanded
him
20
10
and
moses
and
aaron
gathered
the
congregation
together
before
the
rock
and
he
said
unto
them
hear
now
ye
rebels
must
we
fetch
you
water
out
of
this
rock
20
11
and
moses
lifted
up
his
hand
and
with
his
rod
he
smote
the
rock
twice
and
the
water
came
out
abundantly
and
the
congregation
drank
and
their
beasts
also
20
12
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
because
ye
believed
me
not
to
sanctify
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
of
israel
therefore
ye
shall
not
bring
this
congregation
into
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
20
13
this
is
the
water
of
meribah
because
the
children
of
israel
strove
with
the
lord
and
he
was
sanctified
in
them
20
14
and
moses
sent
messengers
from
kadesh
unto
the
king
of
edom
thus
saith
thy
brother
israel
thou
knowest
all
the
travail
that
hath
befallen
us
20
15
how
our
fathers
went
down
into
egypt
and
we
have
dwelt
in
egypt
a
long
time
and
the
egyptians
vexed
us
and
our
fathers
20
16
and
when
we
cried
unto
the
lord
he
heard
our
voice
and
sent
an
angel
and
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
and
behold
we
are
in
kadesh
a
city
in
the
uttermost
of
thy
border
20
17
let
us
pass
i
pray
thee
through
thy
country
we
will
not
pass
through
the
fields
or
through
the
vineyards
neither
will
we
drink
of
the
water
of
the
wells
we
will
go
by
the
king’s
high
way
we
will
not
turn
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
until
we
have
passed
thy
borders
20
18
and
edom
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
pass
by
me
lest
i
come
out
against
thee
with
the
sword
20
19
and
the
children
of
israel
said
unto
him
we
will
go
by
the
high
way
and
if
i
and
my
cattle
drink
of
thy
water
then
i
will
pay
for
it
i
will
only
without
doing
anything
else
go
through
on
my
feet
20
20
and
he
said
thou
shalt
not
go
through
and
edom
came
out
against
him
with
much
people
and
with
a
strong
hand
20
21
thus
edom
refused
to
give
israel
passage
through
his
border
wherefore
israel
turned
away
from
him
20
22
and
the
children
of
israel
even
the
whole
congregation
journeyed
from
kadesh
and
came
unto
mount
hor
20
23
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
in
mount
hor
by
the
coast
of
the
land
of
edom
saying
20
24
aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people
for
he
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
which
i
have
given
unto
the
children
of
israel
because
ye
rebelled
against
my
word
at
the
water
of
meribah
20
25
take
aaron
and
eleazar
his
son
and
bring
them
up
unto
mount
hor
20
26
and
strip
aaron
of
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
eleazar
his
son
and
aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people
and
shall
die
there
20
27
and
moses
did
as
the
lord
commanded
and
they
went
up
into
mount
hor
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation
20
28
and
moses
stripped
aaron
of
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
eleazar
his
son
and
aaron
died
there
in
the
top
of
the
mount
and
moses
and
eleazar
came
down
from
the
mount
20
29
and
when
all
the
congregation
saw
that
aaron
was
dead
they
mourned
for
aaron
thirty
days
even
all
the
house
of
israel
21
1
and
when
king
arad
the
canaanite
which
dwelt
in
the
south
heard
tell
that
israel
came
by
the
way
of
the
spies
then
he
fought
against
israel
and
took
some
of
them
prisoners
21
2
and
israel
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
said
if
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
this
people
into
my
hand
then
i
will
utterly
destroy
their
cities
21
3
and
the
lord
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
israel
and
delivered
up
the
canaanites
and
they
utterly
destroyed
them
and
their
cities
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
hormah
21
4
and
they
journeyed
from
mount
hor
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
to
compass
the
land
of
edom
and
the
soul
of
the
people
was
much
discouraged
because
of
the
way
21
5
and
the
people
spake
against
god
and
against
moses
wherefore
have
ye
brought
us
up
out
of
egypt
to
die
in
the
wilderness
for
there
is
no
bread
neither
is
there
any
water
and
our
soul
loatheth
this
light
bread
21
6
and
the
lord
sent
fiery
serpents
among
the
people
and
they
bit
the
people
and
much
people
of
israel
died
21
7
therefore
the
people
came
to
moses
and
said
we
have
sinned
for
we
have
spoken
against
the
lord
and
against
thee
pray
unto
the
lord
that
he
take
away
the
serpents
from
us
and
moses
prayed
for
the
people
21
8
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
make
thee
a
fiery
serpent
and
set
it
upon
a
pole
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
one
that
is
bitten
when
he
looketh
upon
it
shall
live
21
9
and
moses
made
a
serpent
of
brass
and
put
it
upon
a
pole
and
it
came
to
pass
that
if
a
serpent
had
bitten
any
man
when
he
beheld
the
serpent
of
brass
he
lived
21
10
and
the
children
of
israel
set
forward
and
pitched
in
oboth
21
11
and
they
journeyed
from
oboth
and
pitched
at
ijeabarim
in
the
wilderness
which
is
before
moab
toward
the
sunrising
21
12
from
thence
they
removed
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
zared
21
13
from
thence
they
removed
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
arnon
which
is
in
the
wilderness
that
cometh
out
of
the
coasts
of
the
amorites
for
arnon
is
the
border
of
moab
between
moab
and
the
amorites
21
14
wherefore
it
is
said
in
the
book
of
the
wars
of
the
lord
what
he
did
in
the
red
sea
and
in
the
brooks
of
arnon
21
15
and
at
the
stream
of
the
brooks
that
goeth
down
to
the
dwelling
of
ar
and
lieth
upon
the
border
of
moab
21
16
and
from
thence
they
went
to
beer
that
is
the
well
whereof
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
gather
the
people
together
and
i
will
give
them
water
21
17
then
israel
sang
this
song
spring
up
o
well
sing
ye
unto
it
21
18
the
princes
digged
the
well
the
nobles
of
the
people
digged
it
by
the
direction
of
the
lawgiver
with
their
staves
and
from
the
wilderness
they
went
to
mattanah
21
19
and
from
mattanah
to
nahaliel
and
from
nahaliel
to
bamoth
21
20
and
from
bamoth
in
the
valley
that
is
in
the
country
of
moab
to
the
top
of
pisgah
which
looketh
toward
jeshimon
21
21
and
israel
sent
messengers
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
saying
21
22
let
me
pass
through
thy
land
we
will
not
turn
into
the
fields
or
into
the
vineyards
we
will
not
drink
of
the
waters
of
the
well
but
we
will
go
along
by
the
king’s
high
way
until
we
be
past
thy
borders
21
23
and
sihon
would
not
suffer
israel
to
pass
through
his
border
but
sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
went
out
against
israel
into
the
wilderness
and
he
came
to
jahaz
and
fought
against
israel
21
24
and
israel
smote
him
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
possessed
his
land
from
arnon
unto
jabbok
even
unto
the
children
of
ammon
for
the
border
of
the
children
of
ammon
was
strong
21
25
and
israel
took
all
these
cities
and
israel
dwelt
in
all
the
cities
of
the
amorites
in
heshbon
and
in
all
the
villages
thereof
21
26
for
heshbon
was
the
city
of
sihon
the
king
of
the
amorites
who
had
fought
against
the
former
king
of
moab
and
taken
all
his
land
out
of
his
hand
even
unto
arnon
21
27
wherefore
they
that
speak
in
proverbs
say
come
into
heshbon
let
the
city
of
sihon
be
built
and
prepared
21
28
for
there
is
a
fire
gone
out
of
heshbon
a
flame
from
the
city
of
sihon
it
hath
consumed
ar
of
moab
and
the
lords
of
the
high
places
of
arnon
21
29
woe
to
thee
moab
thou
art
undone
o
people
of
chemosh
he
hath
given
his
sons
that
escaped
and
his
daughters
into
captivity
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
21
30
we
have
shot
at
them
heshbon
is
perished
even
unto
dibon
and
we
have
laid
them
waste
even
unto
nophah
which
reacheth
unto
medeba
21
31
thus
israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
the
amorites
21
32
and
moses
sent
to
spy
out
jaazer
and
they
took
the
villages
thereof
and
drove
out
the
amorites
that
were
there
21
33
and
they
turned
and
went
up
by
the
way
of
bashan
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
went
out
against
them
he
and
all
his
people
to
the
battle
at
edrei
21
34
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
fear
him
not
for
i
have
delivered
him
into
thy
hand
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
and
thou
shalt
do
to
him
as
thou
didst
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
at
heshbon
21
35
so
they
smote
him
and
his
sons
and
all
his
people
until
there
was
none
left
him
alive
and
they
possessed
his
land
22
1
and
the
children
of
israel
set
forward
and
pitched
in
the
plains
of
moab
on
this
side
jordan
by
jericho
22
2
and
balak
the
son
of
zippor
saw
all
that
israel
had
done
to
the
amorites
22
3
and
moab
was
sore
afraid
of
the
people
because
they
were
many
and
moab
was
distressed
because
of
the
children
of
israel
22
4
and
moab
said
unto
the
elders
of
midian
now
shall
this
company
lick
up
all
that
are
round
about
us
as
the
ox
licketh
up
the
grass
of
the
field
and
balak
the
son
of
zippor
was
king
of
the
moabites
at
that
time
22
5
he
sent
messengers
therefore
unto
balaam
the
son
of
beor
to
pethor
which
is
by
the
river
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
his
people
to
call
him
saying
behold
there
is
a
people
come
out
from
egypt
behold
they
cover
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
abide
over
against
me
22
6
come
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
curse
me
this
people
for
they
are
too
mighty
for
me
peradventure
i
shall
prevail
that
we
may
smite
them
and
that
i
may
drive
them
out
of
the
land
for
i
wot
that
he
whom
thou
blessest
is
blessed
and
he
whom
thou
cursest
is
cursed
22
7
and
the
elders
of
moab
and
the
elders
of
midian
departed
with
the
rewards
of
divination
in
their
hand
and
they
came
unto
balaam
and
spake
unto
him
the
words
of
balak
22
8
and
he
said
unto
them
lodge
here
this
night
and
i
will
bring
you
word
again
as
the
lord
shall
speak
unto
me
and
the
princes
of
moab
abode
with
balaam
22
9
and
god
came
unto
balaam
and
said
what
men
are
these
with
thee
22
10
and
balaam
said
unto
god
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
hath
sent
unto
me
saying
22
11
behold
there
is
a
people
come
out
of
egypt
which
covereth
the
face
of
the
earth
come
now
curse
me
them
peradventure
i
shall
be
able
to
overcome
them
and
drive
them
out
22
12
and
god
said
unto
balaam
thou
shalt
not
go
with
them
thou
shalt
not
curse
the
people
for
they
are
blessed
22
13
and
balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
said
unto
the
princes
of
balak
get
you
into
your
land
for
the
lord
refuseth
to
give
me
leave
to
go
with
you
22
14
and
the
princes
of
moab
rose
up
and
they
went
unto
balak
and
said
balaam
refuseth
to
come
with
us
22
15
and
balak
sent
yet
again
princes
more
and
more
honourable
than
they
22
16
and
they
came
to
balaam
and
said
to
him
thus
saith
balak
the
son
of
zippor
let
nothing
i
pray
thee
hinder
thee
from
coming
unto
me
22
17
for
i
will
promote
thee
unto
very
great
honour
and
i
will
do
whatsoever
thou
sayest
unto
me
come
therefore
i
pray
thee
curse
me
this
people
22
18
and
balaam
answered
and
said
unto
the
servants
of
balak
if
balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
i
cannot
go
beyond
the
word
of
the
lord
my
god
to
do
less
or
more
22
19
now
therefore
i
pray
you
tarry
ye
also
here
this
night
that
i
may
know
what
the
lord
will
say
unto
me
more
22
20
and
god
came
unto
balaam
at
night
and
said
unto
him
if
the
men
come
to
call
thee
rise
up
and
go
with
them
but
yet
the
word
which
i
shall
say
unto
thee
that
shalt
thou
do
22
21
and
balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
with
the
princes
of
moab
22
22
and
god’s
anger
was
kindled
because
he
went
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
in
the
way
for
an
adversary
against
him
now
he
was
riding
upon
his
ass
and
his
two
servants
were
with
him
22
23
and
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
standing
in
the
way
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
the
ass
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
and
went
into
the
field
and
balaam
smote
the
ass
to
turn
her
into
the
way
22
24
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
in
a
path
of
the
vineyards
a
wall
being
on
this
side
and
a
wall
on
that
side
22
25
and
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
she
thrust
herself
unto
the
wall
and
crushed
balaam’s
foot
against
the
wall
and
he
smote
her
again
22
26
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
further
and
stood
in
a
narrow
place
where
was
no
way
to
turn
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
22
27
and
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
she
fell
down
under
balaam
and
balaam’s
anger
was
kindled
and
he
smote
the
ass
with
a
staff
22
28
and
the
lord
opened
the
mouth
of
the
ass
and
she
said
unto
balaam
what
have
i
done
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
smitten
me
these
three
times
22
29
and
balaam
said
unto
the
ass
because
thou
hast
mocked
me
i
would
there
were
a
sword
in
mine
hand
for
now
would
i
kill
thee
22
30
and
the
ass
said
unto
balaam
am
not
i
thine
ass
upon
which
thou
hast
ridden
ever
since
i
was
thine
unto
this
day
was
i
ever
wont
to
do
so
unto
thee
and
he
said
nay
22
31
then
the
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
balaam
and
he
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
standing
in
the
way
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
he
bowed
down
his
head
and
fell
flat
on
his
face
22
32
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherefore
hast
thou
smitten
thine
ass
these
three
times
behold
i
went
out
to
withstand
thee
because
thy
way
is
perverse
before
me
22
33
and
the
ass
saw
me
and
turned
from
me
these
three
times
unless
she
had
turned
from
me
surely
now
also
i
had
slain
thee
and
saved
her
alive
22
34
and
balaam
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
i
have
sinned
for
i
knew
not
that
thou
stoodest
in
the
way
against
me
now
therefore
if
it
displease
thee
i
will
get
me
back
again
22
35
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
balaam
go
with
the
men
but
only
the
word
that
i
shall
speak
unto
thee
that
thou
shalt
speak
so
balaam
went
with
the
princes
of
balak
22
36
and
when
balak
heard
that
balaam
was
come
he
went
out
to
meet
him
unto
a
city
of
moab
which
is
in
the
border
of
arnon
which
is
in
the
utmost
coast
22
37
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
did
i
not
earnestly
send
unto
thee
to
call
thee
wherefore
camest
thou
not
unto
me
am
i
not
able
indeed
to
promote
thee
to
honour
22
38
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
lo
i
am
come
unto
thee
have
i
now
any
power
at
all
to
say
any
thing
the
word
that
god
putteth
in
my
mouth
that
shall
i
speak
22
39
and
balaam
went
with
balak
and
they
came
unto
kirjathhuzoth
22
40
and
balak
offered
oxen
and
sheep
and
sent
to
balaam
and
to
the
princes
that
were
with
him
22
41
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
balak
took
balaam
and
brought
him
up
into
the
high
places
of
baal
that
thence
he
might
see
the
utmost
part
of
the
people
23
1
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
build
me
here
seven
altars
and
prepare
me
here
seven
oxen
and
seven
rams
23
2
and
balak
did
as
balaam
had
spoken
and
balak
and
balaam
offered
on
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram
23
3
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
stand
by
thy
burnt
offering
and
i
will
go
peradventure
the
lord
will
come
to
meet
me
and
whatsoever
he
sheweth
me
i
will
tell
thee
and
he
went
to
an
high
place
23
4
and
god
met
balaam
and
he
said
unto
him
i
have
prepared
seven
altars
and
i
have
offered
upon
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram
23
5
and
the
lord
put
a
word
in
balaam’s
mouth
and
said
return
unto
balak
and
thus
thou
shalt
speak
23
6
and
he
returned
unto
him
and
lo
he
stood
by
his
burnt
sacrifice
he
and
all
the
princes
of
moab
23
7
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balak
the
king
of
moab
hath
brought
me
from
aram
out
of
the
mountains
of
the
east
saying
come
curse
me
jacob
and
come
defy
israel
23
8
how
shall
i
curse
whom
god
hath
not
cursed
or
how
shall
i
defy
whom
the
lord
hath
not
defied
23
9
for
from
the
top
of
the
rocks
i
see
him
and
from
the
hills
i
behold
him
lo
the
people
shall
dwell
alone
and
shall
not
be
reckoned
among
the
nations
23
10
who
can
count
the
dust
of
jacob
and
the
number
of
the
fourth
part
of
israel
let
me
die
the
death
of
the
righteous
and
let
my
last
end
be
like
his
23
11
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
what
hast
thou
done
unto
me
i
took
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies
and
behold
thou
hast
blessed
them
altogether
23
12
and
he
answered
and
said
must
i
not
take
heed
to
speak
that
which
the
lord
hath
put
in
my
mouth
23
13
and
balak
said
unto
him
come
i
pray
thee
with
me
unto
another
place
from
whence
thou
mayest
see
them
thou
shalt
see
but
the
utmost
part
of
them
and
shalt
not
see
them
all
and
curse
me
them
from
thence
23
14
and
he
brought
him
into
the
field
of
zophim
to
the
top
of
pisgah
and
built
seven
altars
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar
23
15
and
he
said
unto
balak
stand
here
by
thy
burnt
offering
while
i
meet
the
lord
yonder
23
16
and
the
lord
met
balaam
and
put
a
word
in
his
mouth
and
said
go
again
unto
balak
and
say
thus
23
17
and
when
he
came
to
him
behold
he
stood
by
his
burnt
offering
and
the
princes
of
moab
with
him
and
balak
said
unto
him
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
23
18
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
rise
up
balak
and
hear
hearken
unto
me
thou
son
of
zippor
23
19
god
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
lie
neither
the
son
of
man
that
he
should
repent
hath
he
said
and
shall
he
not
do
it
or
hath
he
spoken
and
shall
he
not
make
it
good
23
20
behold
i
have
received
commandment
to
bless
and
he
hath
blessed
and
i
cannot
reverse
it
23
21
he
hath
not
beheld
iniquity
in
jacob
neither
hath
he
seen
perverseness
in
israel
the
lord
his
god
is
with
him
and
the
shout
of
a
king
is
among
them
23
22
god
brought
them
out
of
egypt
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn
23
23
surely
there
is
no
enchantment
against
jacob
neither
is
there
any
divination
against
israel
according
to
this
time
it
shall
be
said
of
jacob
and
of
israel
what
hath
god
wrought
23
24
behold
the
people
shall
rise
up
as
a
great
lion
and
lift
up
himself
as
a
young
lion
he
shall
not
lie
down
until
he
eat
of
the
prey
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
slain
23
25
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
neither
curse
them
at
all
nor
bless
them
at
all
23
26
but
balaam
answered
and
said
unto
balak
told
not
i
thee
saying
all
that
the
lord
speaketh
that
i
must
do
23
27
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
come
i
pray
thee
i
will
bring
thee
unto
another
place
peradventure
it
will
please
god
that
thou
mayest
curse
me
them
from
thence
23
28
and
balak
brought
balaam
unto
the
top
of
peor
that
looketh
toward
jeshimon
23
29
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
build
me
here
seven
altars
and
prepare
me
here
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
23
30
and
balak
did
as
balaam
had
said
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar
24
1
and
when
balaam
saw
that
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bless
israel
he
went
not
as
at
other
times
to
seek
for
enchantments
but
he
set
his
face
toward
the
wilderness
24
2
and
balaam
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
he
saw
israel
abiding
in
his
tents
according
to
their
tribes
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
him
24
3
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balaam
the
son
of
beor
hath
said
and
the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said
24
4
he
hath
said
which
heard
the
words
of
god
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
almighty
falling
into
a
trance
but
having
his
eyes
open
24
5
how
goodly
are
thy
tents
o
jacob
and
thy
tabernacles
o
israel
24
6
as
the
valleys
are
they
spread
forth
as
gardens
by
the
river’s
side
as
the
trees
of
lign
aloes
which
the
lord
hath
planted
and
as
cedar
trees
beside
the
waters
24
7
he
shall
pour
the
water
out
of
his
buckets
and
his
seed
shall
be
in
many
waters
and
his
king
shall
be
higher
than
agag
and
his
kingdom
shall
be
exalted
24
8
god
brought
him
forth
out
of
egypt
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn
he
shall
eat
up
the
nations
his
enemies
and
shall
break
their
bones
and
pierce
them
through
with
his
arrows
24
9
he
couched
he
lay
down
as
a
lion
and
as
a
great
lion
who
shall
stir
him
up
blessed
is
he
that
blesseth
thee
and
cursed
is
he
that
curseth
thee
24
10
and
balak’s
anger
was
kindled
against
balaam
and
he
smote
his
hands
together
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
i
called
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies
and
behold
thou
hast
altogether
blessed
them
these
three
times
24
11
therefore
now
flee
thou
to
thy
place
i
thought
to
promote
thee
unto
great
honour
but
lo
the
lord
hath
kept
thee
back
from
honour
24
12
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
spake
i
not
also
to
thy
messengers
which
thou
sentest
unto
me
saying
24
13
if
balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
i
cannot
go
beyond
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
do
either
good
or
bad
of
mine
own
mind
but
what
the
lord
saith
that
will
i
speak
24
14
and
now
behold
i
go
unto
my
people
come
therefore
and
i
will
advertise
thee
what
this
people
shall
do
to
thy
people
in
the
latter
days
24
15
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balaam
the
son
of
beor
hath
said
and
the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said
24
16
he
hath
said
which
heard
the
words
of
god
and
knew
the
knowledge
of
the
most
high
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
almighty
falling
into
a
trance
but
having
his
eyes
open
24
17
i
shall
see
him
but
not
now
i
shall
behold
him
but
not
nigh
there
shall
come
a
star
out
of
jacob
and
a
sceptre
shall
rise
out
of
israel
and
shall
smite
the
corners
of
moab
and
destroy
all
the
children
of
sheth
24
18
and
edom
shall
be
a
possession
seir
also
shall
be
a
possession
for
his
enemies
and
israel
shall
do
valiantly
24
19
out
of
jacob
shall
come
he
that
shall
have
dominion
and
shall
destroy
him
that
remaineth
of
the
city
24
20
and
when
he
looked
on
amalek
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
amalek
was
the
first
of
the
nations
but
his
latter
end
shall
be
that
he
perish
for
ever
24
21
and
he
looked
on
the
kenites
and
took
up
his
parable
and
said
strong
is
thy
dwellingplace
and
thou
puttest
thy
nest
in
a
rock
24
22
nevertheless
the
kenite
shall
be
wasted
until
asshur
shall
carry
thee
away
captive
24
23
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
alas
who
shall
live
when
god
doeth
this
24
24
and
ships
shall
come
from
the
coast
of
chittim
and
shall
afflict
asshur
and
shall
afflict
eber
and
he
also
shall
perish
for
ever
24
25
and
balaam
rose
up
and
went
and
returned
to
his
place
and
balak
also
went
his
way
25
1
and
israel
abode
in
shittim
and
the
people
began
to
commit
whoredom
with
the
daughters
of
moab
25
2
and
they
called
the
people
unto
the
sacrifices
of
their
gods
and
the
people
did
eat
and
bowed
down
to
their
gods
25
3
and
israel
joined
himself
unto
baalpeor
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
25
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
take
all
the
heads
of
the
people
and
hang
them
up
before
the
lord
against
the
sun
that
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
may
be
turned
away
from
israel
25
5
and
moses
said
unto
the
judges
of
israel
slay
ye
every
one
his
men
that
were
joined
unto
baalpeor
25
6
and
behold
one
of
the
children
of
israel
came
and
brought
unto
his
brethren
a
midianitish
woman
in
the
sight
of
moses
and
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
who
were
weeping
before
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
25
7
and
when
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
the
priest
saw
it
he
rose
up
from
among
the
congregation
and
took
a
javelin
in
his
hand
25
8
and
he
went
after
the
man
of
israel
into
the
tent
and
thrust
both
of
them
through
the
man
of
israel
and
the
woman
through
her
belly
so
the
plague
was
stayed
from
the
children
of
israel
25
9
and
those
that
died
in
the
plague
were
twenty
and
four
thousand
25
10
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
25
11
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
the
priest
hath
turned
my
wrath
away
from
the
children
of
israel
while
he
was
zealous
for
my
sake
among
them
that
i
consumed
not
the
children
of
israel
in
my
jealousy
25
12
wherefore
say
behold
i
give
unto
him
my
covenant
of
peace
25
13
and
he
shall
have
it
and
his
seed
after
him
even
the
covenant
of
an
everlasting
priesthood
because
he
was
zealous
for
his
god
and
made
an
atonement
for
the
children
of
israel
25
14
now
the
name
of
the
israelite
that
was
slain
even
that
was
slain
with
the
midianitish
woman
was
zimri
the
son
of
salu
a
prince
of
a
chief
house
among
the
simeonites
25
15
and
the
name
of
the
midianitish
woman
that
was
slain
was
cozbi
the
daughter
of
zur
he
was
head
over
a
people
and
of
a
chief
house
in
midian
25
16
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
25
17
vex
the
midianites
and
smite
them
25
18
for
they
vex
you
with
their
wiles
wherewith
they
have
beguiled
you
in
the
matter
of
peor
and
in

give

the

speak
right
thou
shalt
surely
give
them
a

a
man
die

then
ye
shall
cause

9
and

have
no
daughter
then
ye
shall
give

unto

27
10
and
if
he
have
no
brethren
then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
father’s
brethren
27
11
and
if
his

have
no
brethren
then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
kinsman
that
is
next
to
him
of

and
he
shall
possess
it
and
it
shall
be
unto
the
children
of
israel
a
statute
of
judgment
as
the
lord
commanded

said
unto

get
thee
up
into
this
mount
abarim

see
the
land
which
i
have
given
unto
the
children
of
israel
27
13
and
when
thou
hast
seen
it
thou
also
shalt
be
gathered
unto
thy
people
as
aaron
thy
brother
was
gathered
27
14
for
ye
rebelled
against
my
commandment
in

saying
27
16
let
the
lord
the
god
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh
set
a
man
over
the
congregation
27
17
which

before
them
and
which
may
go
in
before
them
and
which
may
lead
them
out

may
bring
them
in
that
the
congregation
of
the
lord
be
not
as
sheep
which
have
no
shepherd
27
18
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
take
thee
joshua
the
son
of
nun
a
man
in
whom
is
the
spirit
and
lay
thine
hand
upon
him
27
19

set
him
before
eleazar
the
priest
and
before
all
the
congregation
and
give
him
a
charge
in
their
sight
27
20
and
thou
shalt
put
some
of
thine
honour
upon
him
that
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
may
be
obedient
27
21
and
he
shall
stand
before
eleazar
the
priest
who
shall
ask
counsel
for
him
after
the
judgment
of
urim
before
the
lord
at

shall
they
go
out

at

they
shall
come
in
both
he
and
all
the
children
of

with
him
even

of
peor
and
there
was
a
plague
among
the
congregation
of
the
lord
31
17
now
therefore
kill
every
male
among
the
little
ones
and
kill
every
woman
that
hath
known
man
by
lying
with
him
31
18
but
all
the
women
children
that
have
not
known
a
man
by
lying
with
him
keep
alive
for
yourselves
31
19
and
do
ye
abide
without
the
camp
seven
days
whosoever
hath
killed
any
person
and
whosoever
hath
touched
any
slain
purify
both
yourselves
and
your
captives
on
the
third

and
on

and
purify
all

that
is
made
of
skins
and
all
work
of

hair
and
all
things
made
of

31
21
and
eleazar
the
priest
said
unto
the
men
of
war
which
went
to
the
battle
this
is
the
ordinance
of
the
law
which
the
lord
commanded

31
22
only
the
gold
and
the
silver
the
brass
the

31
23
every
thing
that
may
abide
the
fire
ye
shall
make
it
go
through
the
fire
and
it
shall
be
clean
nevertheless
it
shall
be
purified
with
the
water
of

and
all
that
abideth
not
the
fire
ye
shall
make
go
through
the
water
31
24
and
ye
shall
wash
your
clothes
on
the
seventh
day
and
ye
shall
be
clean
and
afterward
ye
shall
come
into
the
camp
31
25
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
31
26
take
the

that
was
taken
both
of

thou
and
eleazar
the

27
and
divide
the
prey
into
two
parts
between
them
that
took
the
war
upon
them
who
went
out
to
battle
and
between
all
the

31
28
and

one

31
29
take
it
of
their
half
and
give
it
unto
eleazar
the
priest
for
an
heave
offering
of
the
lord
31
30
and

thou

of
fifty
of
the
persons
of

give
them
unto
the
levites
which
keep
the
charge
of
the

of
the
lord
31
31
and
moses
and
eleazar
the
priest
did
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
31
32
and
the
booty
being
the
rest
of
the

which
the

in
all
of
women
that
had
not
known
man
by
lying
with
him
31
36
and
the
half
which
was
the
portion
of
them
that
went
out
to

was
in
number
three
hundred
thousand
and

unto
eleazar
the

as
the

31
42
and
of
the
children
of
israel’s
half
which
moses
divided
from
the

that
warred
31
43
(now

31
47
even
of
the
children
of
israel’s
half
moses
took
one
portion
of
fifty
both
of
man
and
of
beast
and
gave
them
unto
the
levites
which
kept
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
31
48
and
the
officers
which
were
over
thousands
of
the
host
the
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
came
near
unto
moses
31
49
and
they
said
unto
moses
thy
servants
have
taken
the
sum
of
the
men
of
war
which
are
under
our
charge
and
there
lacketh
not
one
man
of
us
31
50
we
have
therefore
brought
an
oblation
for
the
lord
what
every
man
hath
gotten
of
jewels
of
gold
chains
and
bracelets
rings
earrings
and
tablets
to
make
an
atonement
for
our
souls
before
the
lord
31
51
and
moses
and
eleazar
the
priest
took
the
gold
of
them
even
all
wrought
jewels
31
52
and
all
the
gold
of
the
offering
that
they
offered
up
to
the
lord
of
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
the
captains
of
hundreds
was
sixteen
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
shekels
31
53
(for
the
men
of
war
had
taken
spoil
every
man
for
himself
)
31
54
and
moses
and
eleazar
the
priest
took
the
gold
of
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds
and
brought
it
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
for
a
memorial
for
the
children
of
israel
before
the
lord
32
1
now
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
had
a
very
great
multitude
of
cattle
and
when
they
saw
the
land
of
jazer
and
the
land
of
gilead
that
behold
the
place
was
a
place
for
cattle
32
2
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
came
and
spake
unto
moses
and
to
eleazar
the
priest
and
unto
the
princes
of
the
congregation
saying
32
3
ataroth
and
dibon
and
jazer
and
nimrah
and
heshbon
and
elealeh
and
shebam
and
nebo
and
beon
32
4
even
the
country
which
the
lord
smote
before
the
congregation
of
israel
is
a
land
for
cattle
and
thy
servants
have
cattle
32
5
wherefore
said
they
if
we
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
let
this
land
be
given
unto
thy
servants
for
a
possession
and
bring
us
not
over
jordan
32
6
and
moses
said
unto
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
children
of
reuben
shall
your
brethren
go
to
war
and
shall
ye
sit
here
32
7
and
wherefore
discourage
ye
the
heart
of
the
children
of
israel
from
going
over
into
the
land
which
the
lord
hath
given
them
32
8
thus
did
your
fathers
when
i
sent
them
from
kadeshbarnea
to
see
the
land
32
9
for
when
they
went
up
unto
the
valley
of
eshcol
and
saw
the
land
they
discouraged
the
heart
of
the
children
of
israel
that
they
should
not
go
into
the
land
which
the
lord
had
given
them
32
10
and
the
lord’s
anger
was
kindled
the
same
time
and
he
sware
saying
32
11
surely
none
of
the
men
that
came
up
out
of
egypt
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
shall
see
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
because
they
have
not
wholly
followed
me
32
12
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
for
they
have
wholly
followed
the
lord
32
13
and
the
lord’s
anger
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
made
them
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
until
all
the
generation
that
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
was
consumed
32
14
and
behold
ye
are
risen
up
in
your
fathers’
stead
an
increase
of
sinful
men
to
augment
yet
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
toward
israel
32
15
for
if
ye
turn
away
from
after
him
he
will
yet
again
leave
them
in
the
wilderness
and
ye
shall
destroy
all
this
people
32
16
and
they
came
near
unto
him
and
said
we
will
build
sheepfolds
here
for
our
cattle
and
cities
for
our
little
ones
32
17
but
we
ourselves
will
go
ready
armed
before
the
children
of
israel
until
we
have
brought
them
unto
their
place
and
our
little
ones
shall
dwell
in
the
fenced
cities
because
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
32
18
we
will
not
return
unto
our
houses
until
the
children
of
israel
have
inherited
every
man
his
inheritance
32
19
for
we
will
not
inherit
with
them
on
yonder
side
jordan
or
forward
because
our
inheritance
is
fallen
to
us
on
this
side
jordan
eastward
32
20
and
moses
said
unto
them
if
ye
will
do
this
thing
if
ye
will
go
armed
before
the
lord
to
war
32
21
and
will
go
all
of
you
armed
over
jordan
before
the
lord
until
he
hath
driven
out
his
enemies
from
before
him
32
22
and
the
land
be
subdued
before
the
lord
then
afterward
ye
shall
return
and
be
guiltless
before
the
lord
and
before
israel
and
this
land
shall
be
your
possession
before
the
lord
32
23
but
if
ye
will
not
do
so
behold
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
be
sure
your
sin
will
find
you
out
32
24
build
you
cities
for
your
little
ones
and
folds
for
your
sheep
and
do
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
your
mouth
32
25
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
spake
unto
moses
saying
thy
servants
will
do
as
my
lord
commandeth
32
26
our
little
ones
our
wives
our
flocks
and
all
our
cattle
shall
be
there
in
the
cities
of
gilead
32
27
but
thy
servants
will
pass
over
every
man
armed
for
war
before
the
lord
to
battle
as
my
lord
saith
32
28
so
concerning
them
moses
commanded
eleazar
the
priest
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
the
chief
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
32
29
and
moses
said
unto
them
if
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
will
pass
with
you
over
jordan
every
man
armed
to
battle
before
the
lord
and
the
land
shall
be
subdued
before
you
then
ye
shall
give
them
the
land
of
gilead
for
a
possession
32
30
but
if
they
will
not
pass
over
with
you
armed
they
shall
have
possessions
among
you
in
the
land
of
canaan
32
31
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
answered
saying
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thy
servants
so
will
we
do
32
32
we
will
pass
over
armed
before
the
lord
into
the
land
of
canaan
that
the
possession
of
our
inheritance
on
this
side
jordan
may
be
ours
32
33
and
moses
gave
unto
them
even
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
children
of
reuben
and
unto
half
the
tribe
of

the

with

thereof
in

of
the

(their
names
being
changed
)
and
shibmah
and
gave
other
names
unto
the
cities
which
they
builded
32
39
and
the
children
of
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
went
to
gilead
and
took
it
and
dispossessed
the
amorite
which
was
in
it
32
40
and
moses
gave
gilead
unto
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
and
he
dwelt
therein
32
41
and
jair
the
son
of
manasseh
went
and
took
the
small
towns
thereof
and
called
them
havothjair
32
42
and
nobah
went
and
took
kenath
and
the
villages
thereof
and
called
it
nobah
after
his
own
name
33

35
31
moreover
ye
shall
take
no
satisfaction
for
the
life
of
a
murderer
which
is
guilty
of
death
but
he
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
35
32
and
ye

they
think
best
only
to
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
their
father
shall
they
marry
36
7
so
shall
not
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
israel
remove
from
tribe
to
tribe
for
every
one
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
himself
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
his
fathers
36
8
and
every
daughter
that
possesseth
an
inheritance
in
any
tribe
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
be
wife
unto
one
of
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
her
father
that
the
children
of
israel
may
enjoy
every
man
the
inheritance
of
his
fathers
36
9
neither
shall
the
inheritance
remove
from
one
tribe
to
another
tribe
but
every
one
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
himself
to
his
own
inheritance
36
10
even
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
did
the
daughters
of
zelophehad
36
11
for
mahlah
tirzah
and
hoglah
and
milcah
and
noah
the
daughters
of
zelophehad
were
married
unto
their
father’s
brothers’
sons
36
12
and
they
were
married
into
the
families
of
the
sons
of
manasseh
the
son
of
joseph
and
their
inheritance
remained
in
the
tribe
of
the
family
of
their
father
36
13
these
are
the
commandments
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
commanded
by
the
hand
of
moses
unto
the
children
of
israel
in
the
plains
of
moab
by
jordan
near
jericho
the
fifth
book
of
moses
called
deuteronomy
1
1
these
be
the
words
which
moses
spake
unto
all
israel
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
wilderness
in
the
plain
over
against
the
red
sea
between
paran
and
tophel
and
laban
and
hazeroth
and
dizahab
1

(there
are
eleven
days’
journey
from
horeb
by
the
way
of
mount
seir
unto
kadeshbarnea
)
1
3
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fortieth
year
in
the
eleventh
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
according
unto
all
that
the
lord
had
given
him
in
commandment
unto
them
1
4
after
he
had
slain
sihon
the
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
heshbon
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
which
dwelt
at
astaroth
in
edrei
1
5
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
land
of
moab
began
moses
to
declare
this
law
saying
1
6
the
lord
our
god
spake
unto
us
in
horeb
saying
ye
have
dwelt
long
enough
in
this
mount
1
7
turn
you
and
take
your
journey
and
go
to
the
mount
of
the
amorites
and
unto
all
the
places
nigh
thereunto
in
the
plain
in
the
hills
and
in
the
vale
and
in
the
south
and
by
the
sea
side
to
the
land
of
the
canaanites
and
unto
lebanon
unto
the
great
river
the
river
euphrates
1
8
behold
i
have
set
the
land
before
you
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
after
them
1
9
and
i
spake
unto
you
at
that
time
saying
i
am
not
able
to
bear
you
myself
alone
1
10
the
lord
your
god
hath
multiplied
you
and
behold
ye
are
this
day
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude
1
11
(the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
make
you
a
thousand
times
so
many
more
as
ye
are
and
bless
you
as
he
hath
promised
you
)
1
12
how
can
i
myself
alone
bear
your
cumbrance
and
your
burden
and
your
strife
1
13
take
you
wise
men
and
understanding
and
known
among
your
tribes
and
i
will
make
them
rulers
over
you
1
14
and
ye
answered
me
and
said
the
thing
which
thou
hast
spoken
is
good
for
us
to
do
1
15
so
i
took
the
chief
of
your
tribes
wise
men
and
known
and
made
them
heads
over
you
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
hundreds
and
captains
over
fifties
and
captains
over
tens
and
officers
among
your
tribes
1
16
and
i
charged
your
judges
at
that
time
saying
hear
the
causes
between
your
brethren
and
judge
righteously
between
every
man
and
his
brother
and
the
stranger
that
is
with
him
1
17
ye
shall
not
respect
persons
in
judgment
but
ye
shall
hear
the
small
as
well
as
the
great
ye
shall
not
be
afraid
of
the
face
of
man
for
the
judgment
is
god’s
and
the
cause
that
is
too
hard
for
you
bring
it
unto
me
and
i
will
hear
it
1
18
and
i
commanded
you
at
that
time
all
the
things
which
ye
should
do
1
19
and
when
we
departed
from
horeb
we
went
through
all
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness
which
ye
saw
by
the
way
of
the
mountain
of
the
amorites
as
the
lord
our
god
commanded
us
and
we
came
to
kadeshbarnea
1
20
and
i
said
unto
you
ye
are
come
unto
the
mountain
of
the
amorites
which
the
lord
our
god
doth
give
unto
us
1
21
behold
the
lord
thy
god
hath
set
the
land
before
thee
go
up
and
possess
it
as
the
lord
god
of
thy
fathers
hath
said
unto
thee
fear
not
neither
be
discouraged
1
22
and
ye
came
near
unto
me
every
one
of
you
and
said
we
will
send
men
before
us
and
they
shall
search
us
out
the
land
and
bring
us
word
again
by
what
way
we
must
go
up
and
into
what
cities
we
shall
come
1
23
and
the
saying
pleased
me
well
and
i
took
twelve
men
of
you
one
of
a
tribe
1
24
and
they
turned
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
came
unto
the
valley
of
eshcol
and
searched
it
out
1
25
and
they
took
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
in
their
hands
and
brought
it
down
unto
us
and
brought
us
word
again
and
said
it
is
a
good
land
which
the
lord
our
god
doth
give
us
1
26
notwithstanding
ye
would
not
go
up
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
god
1
27
and
ye
murmured
in
your
tents
and
said
because
the
lord
hated
us
he
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
amorites
to
destroy
us
1
28
whither
shall
we
go
up
our
brethren
have
discouraged
our
heart
saying
the
people
is
greater
and
taller
than
we
the
cities
are
great
and
walled
up
to
heaven
and
moreover
we
have
seen
the
sons
of
the
anakims
there
1
29
then
i
said
unto
you
dread
not
neither
be
afraid
of
them
1
30
the
lord
your
god
which
goeth
before
you
he
shall
fight
for
you
according
to
all
that
he
did
for
you
in
egypt
before
your
eyes
1
31
and
in
the
wilderness
where
thou
hast
seen
how
that
the
lord
thy
god
bare
thee
as
a
man
doth
bear
his
son
in
all
the
way
that
ye
went
until
ye
came
into
this
place
1
32
yet
in
this
thing
ye
did
not
believe
the
lord
your
god
1
33
who
went
in
the
way
before
you
to
search
you
out
a
place
to
pitch
your
tents
in
in
fire
by
night
to
shew
you
by
what
way
ye
should
go
and
in
a
cloud
by
day
1
34
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
your
words
and
was
wroth
and
sware
saying
1
35
surely
there
shall
not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
see
that
good
land
which
i
sware
to
give
unto
your
fathers
1
36
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
he
shall
see
it
and
to
him
will
i
give
the
land
that
he
hath
trodden
upon
and
to
his
children
because
he
hath
wholly
followed
the
lord
1
37
also
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
sakes
saying
thou
also
shalt
not
go
in
thither
1
38
but
joshua
the
son
of
nun
which
standeth
before
thee
he
shall
go
in
thither
encourage
him
for
he
shall
cause
israel
to
inherit
it
1
39
moreover
your
little
ones
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey
and
your
children
which
in
that
day
had
no
knowledge
between
good
and
evil
they
shall
go
in
thither
and
unto
them
will
i
give
it
and
they
shall
possess
it
1
40
but
as
for
you
turn
you
and
take
your
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
1
41
then
ye
answered
and
said
unto
me
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
we
will
go
up
and
fight
according
to
all
that
the
lord
our
god
commanded
us
and
when
ye
had
girded
on
every
man
his
weapons
of
war
ye
were
ready
to
go
up
into
the
hill
1
42
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
say
unto
them
go
not
up
neither
fight
for
i
am
not
among
you
lest
ye
be
smitten
before
your
enemies
1
43
so
i
spake
unto
you
and
ye
would
not
hear
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
went
presumptuously
up
into
the
hill
1
44
and
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
that
mountain
came
out
against
you
and
chased
you
as
bees
do
and
destroyed
you
in
seir
even
unto
hormah
1
45
and
ye
returned
and
wept
before
the
lord
but
the
lord
would
not
hearken
to
your
voice
nor
give
ear
unto
you
1
46
so
ye
abode
in
kadesh
many
days
according
unto
the
days
that
ye
abode
there
2
1
then
we
turned
and
took
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
as
the
lord
spake
unto
me
and
we
compassed
mount
seir
many
days
2
2
and
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
2
3
ye
have
compassed
this
mountain
long
enough
turn
you
northward
2
4
and
command
thou
the
people
saying
ye
are
to
pass
through
the
coast
of
your
brethren
the
children
of
esau
which
dwell
in
seir
and
they
shall
be
afraid
of
you
take
ye
good
heed
unto
yourselves
therefore
2
5
meddle
not
with
them
for
i
will
not
give
you
of
their
land
no
not
so
much
as
a
foot
breadth
because
i
have
given
mount
seir
unto
esau
for
a
possession
2
6
ye
shall
buy
meat
of
them
for
money
that
ye
may
eat
and
ye
shall
also
buy
water
of
them
for
money
that
ye
may
drink
2
7
for
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
in
all
the
works
of
thy
hand
he
knoweth
thy
walking
through
this
great
wilderness
these
forty
years
the
lord
thy
god
hath
been
with
thee
thou
hast
lacked
nothing
2
8
and
when
we
passed
by
from
our
brethren
the
children
of
esau
which
dwelt
in
seir
through
the
way
of
the
plain
from
elath
and
from
eziongaber
we
turned
and
passed
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
moab
2
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
distress
not
the
moabites
neither
contend
with
them
in
battle
for
i
will
not
give
thee
of
their
land
for
a
possession
because
i
have
given
ar
unto
the
children
of
lot
for
a
possession
2
10
the
emims
dwelt
therein
in
times
past
a
people
great
and
many
and
tall
as
the
anakims
2
11
which
also
were
accounted
giants
as
the
anakims
but
the
moabites
called
them
emims
2
12
the
horims
also
dwelt
in
seir
beforetime
but
the
children
of
esau
succeeded
them
when
they
had
destroyed
them
from
before
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
as
israel
did
unto
the
land
of
his
possession
which
the
lord
gave
unto
them
2
13
now
rise
up
said
i
and
get
you
over
the
brook
zered
and
we
went
over
the
brook
zered
2
14
and
the
space
in
which
we
came
from
kadeshbarnea
until
we
were
come
over
the
brook
zered
was
thirty
and
eight
years
until
all
the
generation
of
the
men
of
war
were
wasted
out
from
among
the
host
as
the
lord
sware
unto
them
2
15
for
indeed
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
to
destroy
them
from
among
the
host
until
they
were
consumed
2
16
so
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
men
of
war
were
consumed
and
dead
from
among
the
people
2
17
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
2
18
thou
art
to
pass
over
through
ar
the
coast
of
moab
this
day
2
19
and
when
thou
comest
nigh
over
against
the
children
of
ammon
distress
them
not
nor
meddle
with
them
for
i
will
not
give
thee
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
any
possession
because
i
have
given
it
unto
the
children
of
lot
for
a
possession
2
20
(that
also
was
accounted
a
land
of
giants
giants
dwelt
therein
in
old
time
and
the
ammonites
call
them
zamzummims
2
21
a
people
great
and
many
and
tall
as
the
anakims
but
the
lord
destroyed
them
before
them
and
they
succeeded
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
2
22
as
he
did
to
the
children
of
esau
which
dwelt
in
seir
when
he
destroyed
the
horims
from
before
them
and
they
succeeded
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
even
unto
this
day
2
23
and
the
avims
which
dwelt
in
hazerim
even
unto
azzah
the
caphtorims
which
came
forth
out
of
caphtor
destroyed
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
)
2
24
rise
ye
up
take
your
journey
and
pass
over
the
river
arnon
behold
i
have
given
into
thine
hand
sihon
the
amorite
king
of
heshbon
and
his
land
begin
to
possess
it
and
contend
with
him
in
battle
2
25
this
day
will
i
begin
to
put
the
dread
of
thee
and
the
fear
of
thee
upon
the
nations
that
are
under
the
whole
heaven
who
shall
hear
report
of
thee
and
shall
tremble
and
be
in
anguish
because
of
thee
2
26
and
i
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
of
kedemoth
unto
sihon
king
of
heshbon
with
words
of
peace
saying
2
27
let
me
pass
through
thy
land
i
will
go
along
by
the
high
way
i
will
neither
turn
unto
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
2
28
thou
shalt
sell
me
meat
for
money
that
i
may
eat
and
give
me
water
for
money
that
i
may
drink
only
i
will
pass
through
on
my
feet
2
29
(as
the
children
of
esau
which
dwell
in
seir
and
the
moabites
which
dwell
in
ar
did
unto
me
)
until
i
shall
pass
over
jordan
into
the
land
which
the
lord
our
god
giveth
us
2
30
but
sihon
king
of
heshbon
would
not
let
us
pass
by
him
for
the
lord
thy
god
hardened
his
spirit
and
made
his
heart
obstinate
that
he
might
deliver
him
into
thy
hand
as
appeareth
this
day
2
31
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
behold
i
have
begun
to
give
sihon
and
his
land
before
thee
begin
to
possess
that
thou
mayest
inherit
his
land
2
32
then
sihon
came
out
against
us
he
and
all
his
people
to
fight
at
jahaz
2
33
and
the
lord
our
god
delivered
him
before
us
and
we
smote
him
and
his
sons
and
all
his
people
2
34
and
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
time
and
utterly
destroyed
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
little
ones
of
every
city
we
left
none
to
remain
2
35
only
the
cattle
we
took
for
a
prey
unto
ourselves
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
which
we
took
2
36
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
brink
of
the
river
of
arnon
and
from
the
city
that
is
by
the
river
even
unto
gilead
there
was
not
one
city
too
strong
for
us
the
lord
our
god
delivered
all
unto
us
2
37
only
unto
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
thou
camest
not
nor
unto
any
place
of
the
river
jabbok
nor
unto
the
cities
in
the
mountains
nor
unto
whatsoever
the
lord
our
god
forbad
us
3

then
we
turned
and
went
up
the
way
to
bashan
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
came
out
against
us
he
and
all
his
people
to
battle
at
edrei
3
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
fear
him
not
for
i
will
deliver
him
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
into
thy
hand
and
thou
shalt
do
unto
him
as
thou
didst
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
at
heshbon
3
3
so
the
lord
our
god
delivered
into
our
hands
og
also
the
king
of
bashan
and
all
his
people
and
we
smote
him
until
none
was
left
to
him
remaining
3
4
and
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
time
there
was
not
a
city
which
we
took
not
from
them
threescore
cities
all
the
region
of
argob
the
kingdom
of
og
in
bashan
3
5
all
these
cities
were
fenced
with
high
walls
gates
and
bars
beside
unwalled
towns
a
great
many
3
6
and
we
utterly
destroyed
them
as
we
did
unto
sihon
king
of
heshbon
utterly
destroying
the
men
women
and
children
of
every
city
3
7
but
all
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
we
took
for
a
prey
to
ourselves
3
8
and
we
took
at
that
time
out
of
the
hand
of
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
the
land
that
was
on
this
side
jordan
from
the
river
of
arnon
unto
mount
hermon
3

(which
hermon
the
sidonians
call
sirion
and
the
amorites
call
it
shenir
)
3
10
all
the
cities
of
the
plain
and
all
gilead
and
all
bashan
unto
salchah
and
edrei
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
og
in
bashan
3
11
for
only
og
king
of
bashan
remained
of
the
remnant
of
giants
behold
his
bedstead
was
a
bedstead
of
iron
is
it
not
in
rabbath
of
the
children
of
ammon
nine
cubits
was
the
length
thereof
and
four
cubits
the
breadth
of
it
after
the
cubit
of
a
man
3
12
and
this
land
which
we
possessed
at
that
time
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
river
arnon
and
half
mount
gilead
and
the
cities
thereof
gave
i
unto
the
reubenites
and
to
the
gadites
3
13
and
the
rest
of
gilead
and
all
bashan
being
the
kingdom
of
og
gave
i
unto
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
all
the
region
of
argob
with
all
bashan
which
was
called
the
land
of
giants
3
14
jair
the
son
of
manasseh
took
all
the
country
of
argob
unto
the
coasts
of
geshuri
and
maachathi
and
called
them
after
his
own
name
bashanhavothjair
unto
this
day
3
15
and
i
gave
gilead
unto
machir
3
16
and
unto
the
reubenites
and
unto
the
gadites
i
gave
from
gilead
even
unto
the
river
arnon
half
the
valley
and
the
border
even
unto
the
river
jabbok
which
is
the
border
of
the
children
of
ammon
3
17
the
plain
also
and
jordan
and
the
coast
thereof
from
chinnereth
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain
even
the
salt
sea
under
ashdothpisgah
eastward
3
18
and
i
commanded
you
at
that
time
saying
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
this
land
to
possess
it
ye
shall
pass
over
armed
before
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
all
that
are
meet
for
the
war
3
19
but
your
wives
and
your
little
ones
and
your
cattle
(for
i
know
that
ye
have
much
cattle
)
shall
abide
in
your
cities
which
i
have
given
you
3
20
until
the
lord
have
given
rest
unto
your
brethren
as
well
as
unto
you
and
until
they
also
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
them
beyond
jordan
and
then
shall
ye
return
every
man
unto
his
possession
which
i
have
given
you
3
21
and
i
commanded
joshua
at
that
time
saying
thine
eyes
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
your
god
hath
done
unto
these
two
kings
so
shall
the
lord
do
unto
all
the
kingdoms
whither
thou
passest
3
22
ye
shall
not
fear
them
for
the
lord
your
god
he
shall
fight
for
you
3
23
and
i
besought
the
lord
at
that
time
saying
3
24
o
lord
god
thou
hast
begun
to
shew
thy
servant
thy
greatness
and
thy
mighty
hand
for
what
god
is
there
in
heaven
or
in
earth
that
can
do
according
to
thy
works
and
according
to
thy
might
3
25
i
pray
thee
let
me
go
over
and
see
the
good
land
that
is
beyond
jordan
that
goodly
mountain
and
lebanon
3
26
but
the
lord
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
sakes
and
would
not
hear
me
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
let
it
suffice
thee
speak
no
more
unto
me
of
this
matter
3
27
get
thee
up
into
the
top
of
pisgah
and
lift
up
thine
eyes
westward
and
northward
and
southward
and
eastward
and
behold
it
with
thine
eyes
for
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
jordan
3
28
but
charge
joshua
and
encourage
him
and
strengthen
him
for
he
shall
go
over
before
this
people
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
inherit
the
land
which
thou
shalt
see
3
29
so
we
abode
in
the
valley
over
against
bethpeor
4
1
now
therefore
hearken
o
israel
unto
the
statutes
and
unto
the
judgments
which
i
teach
you
for
to
do
them
that
ye
may
live
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
giveth
you
4
2
ye
shall
not
add
unto
the
word
which
i
command
you
neither
shall
ye
diminish
ought
from
it
that
ye
may
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
4
3
your
eyes
have
seen
what
the
lord
did
because
of
baalpeor
for
all
the
men
that
followed
baalpeor
the
lord
thy
god
hath
destroyed
them
from
among
you
4
4
but
ye
that
did
cleave
unto
the
lord
your
god
are
alive
every
one
of
you
this
day
4
5
behold
i
have
taught
you
statutes
and
judgments
even
as
the
lord
my
god
commanded
me
that
ye
should
do
so
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
4
6
keep
therefore
and
do
them
for
this
is
your
wisdom
and
your
understanding
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
which
shall
hear
all
these
statutes
and
say
surely
this
great
nation
is
a
wise
and
understanding
people
4
7
for
what
nation
is
there
so
great
who
hath
god
so
nigh
unto
them
as
the
lord
our
god
is
in
all
things
that
we
call
upon
him
for
4
8
and
what
nation
is
there
so
great
that
hath
statutes
and
judgments
so
righteous
as
all
this
law
which
i
set
before
you
this
day
4
9
only
take
heed
to
thyself
and
keep
thy
soul
diligently
lest
thou
forget
the
things
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
and
lest
they
depart
from
thy
heart
all
the
days
of
thy
life
but
teach
them
thy
sons
and
thy
sons’
sons
4
10
specially
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
horeb
when
the
lord
said
unto
me
gather
me
the
people
together
and
i
will
make
them
hear
my
words
that
they
may
learn
to
fear
me
all
the
days
that
they
shall
live
upon
the
earth
and
that
they
may
teach
their
children
4
11
and
ye
came
near
and
stood
under
the
mountain
and
the
mountain
burned
with
fire
unto
the
midst
of
heaven
with
darkness
clouds
and
thick
darkness
4
12
and
the
lord
spake
unto
you
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
ye
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
but
saw
no
similitude
only
ye
heard
a
voice
4
13
and
he
declared
unto
you
his
covenant
which
he
commanded
you
to
perform
even
ten
commandments
and
he
wrote
them
upon
two
tables
of
stone
4
14
and
the
lord
commanded
me
at
that
time
to
teach
you
statutes
and
judgments
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
to
possess
it
4
15
take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
yourselves
for
ye
saw
no
manner
of
similitude
on
the
day
that
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
4
16
lest
ye
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
you
a
graven
image
the
similitude
of
any
figure
the
likeness
of
male
or
female
4
17
the
likeness
of
any
beast
that
is
on
the
earth
the
likeness
of
any
winged
fowl
that
flieth
in
the
air
4
18
the
likeness
of
any
thing
that
creepeth
on
the
ground
the
likeness
of
any
fish
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
4
19
and
lest
thou
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
when
thou
seest
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
even
all
the
host
of
heaven
shouldest
be
driven
to
worship
them
and
serve
them
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
divided
unto
all
nations
under
the
whole
heaven
4
20
but
the
lord
hath
taken
you
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
iron
furnace
even
out
of
egypt
to
be
unto
him
a
people
of
inheritance
as
ye
are
this
day
4
21
furthermore
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
sakes
and
sware
that
i
should
not
go
over
jordan
and
that
i
should
not
go
in
unto
that
good
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
4
22
but
i
must
die
in
this
land
i
must
not
go
over
jordan
but
ye
shall
go
over
and
possess
that
good
land
4
23
take
heed
unto
yourselves
lest
ye
forget
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
which
he
made
with
you
and
make
you
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
any
thing
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
forbidden
thee
4
24
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
consuming
fire
even
a
jealous
god
4
25
when
thou
shalt
beget
children
and
children’s
children
and
ye
shall
have
remained
long
in
the
land
and
shall
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
any
thing
and
shall
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
provoke
him
to
anger
4
26
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
soon
utterly
perish
from
off
the
land
whereunto
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
it
but
shall
utterly
be
destroyed
4
27
and
the
lord
shall
scatter
you
among
the
nations
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
among
the
heathen
whither
the
lord
shall
lead
you
4
28
and
there
ye
shall
serve
gods
the
work
of
men’s
hands
wood
and
stone
which
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
eat
nor
smell
4
29
but
if
from
thence
thou
shalt
seek
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
find
him
if
thou
seek
him
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
4
30
when
thou
art
in
tribulation
and
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee
even
in
the
latter
days
if
thou
turn
to
the
lord
thy
god
and
shalt
be
obedient
unto
his
voice
4
31
(for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
merciful
god
)
he
will
not
forsake
thee
neither
destroy
thee
nor
forget
the
covenant
of
thy
fathers
which
he
sware
unto
them
4
32
for
ask
now
of
the
days
that
are
past
which
were
before
thee
since
the
day
that
god
created
man
upon
the
earth
and
ask
from
the
one
side
of
heaven
unto
the
other
whether
there
hath
been
any
such
thing
as
this
great
thing
is
or
hath
been
heard
like
it
4
33
did
ever
people
hear
the
voice
of
god
speaking
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
as
thou
hast
heard
and
live
4
34
or
hath
god
assayed
to
go
and
take
him
a
nation
from
the
midst
of
another
nation
by
temptations
by
signs
and
by
wonders
and
by
war
and
by
a
mighty
hand
and
by
a
stretched
out
arm
and
by
great
terrors
according
to
all
that
the
lord
your
god
did
for
you
in
egypt
before
your
eyes
4
35
unto
thee
it
was
shewed
that
thou
mightest
know
that
the
lord
he
is
god
there
is
none
else
beside
him
4
36
out
of
heaven
he
made
thee
to
hear
his
voice
that
he
might
instruct
thee
and
upon
earth
he
shewed
thee
his
great
fire
and
thou
heardest
his
words
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
4
37
and
because
he
loved
thy
fathers
therefore
he
chose
their
seed
after
them
and
brought
thee
out
in
his
sight
with
his
mighty
power
out
of
egypt
4
38
to
drive
out
nations
from
before
thee
greater
and
mightier
than
thou
art
to
bring
thee
in
to
give
thee
their
land
for
an
inheritance
as
it
is
this
day
4
39
know
therefore
this
day
and
consider
it
in
thine
heart
that
the
lord
he
is
god
in
heaven
above
and
upon
the
earth
beneath
there
is
none
else
4
40
thou
shalt
keep
therefore
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days
upon
the
earth
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
ever
4
41
then
moses
severed
three
cities
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
4
42
that
the
slayer
might
flee
thither
which
should
kill
his
neighbour
unawares
and
hated
him
not
in
times
past
and
that
fleeing
unto
one
of
these
cities
he
might
live
4
43
namely
bezer
in
the
wilderness
in
the
plain
country
of
the
reubenites
and
ramoth
in
gilead
of
the
gadites
and
golan
in
bashan
of
the
manassites
4
44
and
this
is
the
law
which
moses
set
before
the
children
of
israel
4
45
these
are
the
testimonies
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
after
they
came
forth
out
of
egypt
4
46
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
valley
over
against
bethpeor
in
the
land
of
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
who
dwelt
at
heshbon
whom
moses
and
the
children
of
israel
smote
after
they
were
come
forth
out
of
egypt
4
47
and
they
possessed
his
land
and
the
land
of
og
king
of
bashan
two
kings
of
the
amorites
which
were
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
4
48
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
bank
of
the
river
arnon
even
unto
mount
sion
which
is
hermon
4
49
and
all
the
plain
on
this
side
jordan
eastward
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain
under
the
springs
of
pisgah
5
1
and
moses
called
all
israel
and
said
unto
them
hear
o
israel
the

the

our
god
made
a
covenant
with
us
in
horeb
5
3
the
lord
made
not
this
covenant
with
our
fathers
but
with
us
even
us
who
are
all
of
us
here
alive
this
day
5

the
lord
talked
with
you
face
to
face
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
5
5
(i
stood
between
the
lord
and
you
at
that
time
to
shew
you
the
word
of
the
lord
for
ye
were
afraid
by
reason
of
the
fire
and
went
not
up
into
the
mount
)
saying
5
6
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
5

thee

or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above
or
that
is
in
the
earth
beneath
or
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
5
9
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
unto
them
nor
serve
them
for

the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
5
10
and
shewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
5
11
thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain

thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
5

six
days
thou
shalt
labour
and
do
all
thy
work
5
14
but
the

thy
god
in
it
thou

any
work

nor

maidservant
nor
thine
ox
nor
thine
ass
nor
any
of
thy
cattle
nor
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
that
thy
manservant
and
thy
maidservant
may
rest
as
well
as
thou
5
15
and
remember
that
thou
wast
a
servant
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
that
the
lord
thy
god
brought
thee
out
thence
through
a
mighty
hand
and
by
a
stretched
out
arm
therefore
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
thee
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
5
16
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
that
thy
days
may
be
prolonged
and
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee

thou

neither
shalt
thou
steal

neither
shalt
thou
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbour
5
21
neither
shalt
thou
desire
thy
neighbour’s
wife
neither
shalt
thou
covet
thy
neighbour’s
house
his
field
or
his
manservant
or
his
maidservant
his
ox
or
his
ass
or
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbour’s
5
22
these
words
the
lord
spake
unto
all
your
assembly
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
of
the
cloud
and
of
the
thick
darkness
with
a
great
voice
and
he
added
no
more
and
he
wrote
them
in
two
tables
of
stone
and
delivered
them
unto
me
5
23
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ye
heard
the
voice
out
of
the
midst
of
the
darkness
(for
the
mountain
did
burn
with
fire
)
that
ye
came
near
unto
me
even
all
the
heads
of
your
tribes
and
your
elders
5
24
and
ye
said
behold
the
lord
our
god
hath
shewed
us
his
glory
and
his
greatness
and
we
have
heard
his
voice
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
we
have
seen
this
day
that
god
doth
talk
with
man
and
he
liveth
5
25
now
therefore
why
should
we
die
for
this
great
fire
will
consume
us
if
we
hear
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
any
more
then
we
shall
die
5
26
for
who
is
there
of
all
flesh
that
hath
heard
the
voice
of
the
living
god
speaking
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
as
we
have
and
lived
5
27
go
thou
near
and
hear
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
say
and
speak
thou
unto
us
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
speak
unto
thee
and
we
will
hear
it
and
do
it
5
28
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
your
words
when
ye
spake
unto
me
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
i
have
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
of
this
people
which
they
have
spoken
unto
thee
they
have
well
said
all
that
they
have
spoken
5
29
o
that
there
were
such
an
heart
in
them
that
they
would
fear
me
and
keep
all
my
commandments
always
that
it
might
be
well
with
them
and
with
their
children
for
ever
5
30
go
say
to
them
get
you
into
your
tents
again
5
31
but
as
for
thee
stand
thou
here
by
me
and
i
will
speak
unto
thee
all
the
commandments
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
teach
them
that
they
may
do
them
in
the
land
which
i
give
them
to
possess
it
5
32
ye
shall
observe
to
do
therefore
as
the
lord
your
god
hath
commanded
you
ye
shall
not
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
5
33
ye
shall
walk
in
all
the
ways
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
commanded
you
that
ye
may
live
and
that
it
may
be
well
with
you
and
that
ye
may
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
which
ye
shall
possess
6
1
now
these
are
the
commandments
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
your
god
commanded
to
teach
you
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
6
2
that
thou
mightest
fear
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
all
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
thou
and
thy
son
and
thy
son’s
son
all
the
days
of
thy
life
and
that
thy
days
may
be
prolonged
6
3
hear
therefore
o
israel
and
observe
to
do
it
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
ye
may
increase
mightily
as
the
lord
god
of
thy
fathers
hath
promised
thee
in
the
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
6
4
hear
o
israel
the
lord
our
god
is
one
lord
6
5
and
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
might
6
6
and
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
be
in
thine
heart
6
7
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
and
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
6
8
and
thou
shalt
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
thine
hand
and
they
shall
be
as
frontlets
between
thine
eyes
6
9
and
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
posts
of
thy
house
and
on
thy
gates
6
10
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
have
brought
thee
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
to
give
thee
great
and
goodly
cities
which
thou
buildedst
not
6
11
and
houses
full
of
all
good
things
which
thou
filledst
not
and
wells
digged
which
thou
diggedst
not
vineyards
and
olive
trees
which
thou
plantedst
not
when
thou
shalt
have
eaten
and
be
full
6
12
then
beware
lest
thou
forget
the
lord
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
6
13
thou
shalt
fear
the
lord
thy
god
and
serve
him
and
shalt
swear
by
his
name
6
14
ye
shall
not
go
after
other
gods
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you
6
15
(for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
among
you)
lest
the
anger
of
the
lord
thy
god
be
kindled
against
thee
and
destroy
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
6
16
ye
shall
not
tempt
the
lord
your
god
as
ye
tempted
him
in
massah
6
17
ye
shall
diligently
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
which
he
hath
commanded
thee
6
18
and
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
and
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
go
in
and
possess
the
good
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
6
19
to
cast
out
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
6
20
and
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
the
testimonies
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
our
god
hath
commanded
you
6
21
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
thy
son
we
were
pharaoh’s
bondmen
in
egypt
and
the
lord
brought
us
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
6
22
and
the
lord
shewed
signs
and
wonders
great
and
sore
upon
egypt
upon
pharaoh
and
upon
all
his
household
before
our
eyes
6
23
and
he
brought
us
out
from
thence
that
he
might
bring
us
in
to
give
us
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
our
fathers
6
24
and
the
lord
commanded
us
to
do
all
these
statutes
to
fear
the
lord
our
god
for
our
good
always
that
he
might
preserve
us
alive
as
it
is
at
this
day
6
25
and
it
shall
be
our
righteousness
if
we
observe
to
do
all
these
commandments
before
the
lord
our
god
as
he
hath
commanded
us
7
1
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
and
hath
cast
out
many
nations
before
thee
the
hittites
and
the
girgashites
and
the
amorites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
seven
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thou
7
2
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
before
thee
thou
shalt
smite
them
and
utterly
destroy
them
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them
nor
shew
mercy
unto
them
7
3
neither
shalt
thou
make
marriages
with
them
thy
daughter
thou
shalt
not
give
unto
his
son
nor
his
daughter
shalt
thou
take
unto
thy
son
7
4
for
they
will
turn
away
thy
son
from
following
me
that
they
may
serve
other
gods
so
will
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
kindled
against
you
and
destroy
thee
suddenly
7
5
but
thus
shall
ye
deal
with
them
ye
shall
destroy
their
altars
and
break
down
their
images
and
cut
down
their
groves
and
burn
their
graven
images
with
fire
7
6
for
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
lord
thy
god
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
special
people
unto
himself
above
all
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
7
7
the
lord
did
not
set
his
love
upon
you
nor
choose
you
because
ye
were
more
in
number
than
any
people
for
ye
were
the
fewest
of
all
people
7
8
but
because
the
lord
loved
you
and
because
he
would
keep
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
unto
your
fathers
hath
the
lord
brought
you
out
with
a
mighty
hand
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen
from
the
hand
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
7
9
know
therefore
that
the
lord
thy
god
he
is
god
the
faithful
god
which
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
with
them
that
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
to
a
thousand
generations
7
10
and
repayeth
them
that
hate
him
to
their
face
to
destroy
them
he
will
not
be
slack
to
him
that
hateth
him
he
will
repay
him
to
his
face
7
11
thou
shalt
therefore
keep
the
commandments
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
do
them
7
12
wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
hearken
to
these
judgments
and
keep
and
do
them
that
the
lord
thy
god
shall
keep
unto
thee
the
covenant
and
the
mercy
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
7
13
and
he
will
love
thee
and
bless
thee
and
multiply
thee
he
will
also
bless
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land
thy
corn
and
thy
wine
and
thine
oil
the
increase
of
thy
kine
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep
in
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee
7
14
thou
shalt
be
blessed
above
all
people
there
shall
not
be
male
or
female
barren
among
you
or
among
your
cattle
7
15
and
the
lord
will
take
away
from
thee
all
sickness
and
will
put
none
of
the
evil
diseases
of
egypt
which
thou
knowest
upon
thee
but
will
lay
them
upon
all
them
that
hate
thee
7
16
and
thou
shalt
consume
all
the
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
thee
thine
eye
shall
have
no
pity
upon
them
neither
shalt
thou
serve
their
gods
for
that
will
be
a
snare
unto
thee
7
17
if
thou
shalt
say
in
thine
heart
these
nations
are
more
than
i
how
can
i
dispossess
them
7
18
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
them
but
shalt
well
remember
what
the
lord
thy
god
did
unto
pharaoh
and
unto
all
egypt
7
19
the
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
saw
and
the
signs
and
the
wonders
and
the
mighty
hand
and
the
stretched
out
arm
whereby
the
lord
thy
god
brought
thee
out
so
shall
the
lord
thy
god
do
unto
all
the
people
of
whom
thou
art
afraid
7
20
moreover
the
lord
thy
god
will
send
the
hornet
among
them
until
they
that
are
left
and
hide
themselves
from
thee
be
destroyed
7
21
thou
shalt
not
be
affrighted
at
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
among
you
a
mighty
god
and
terrible
7
22
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
out
those
nations
before
thee
by
little
and
little
thou
mayest
not
consume
them
at
once
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
thee
7
23
but
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
unto
thee
and
shall
destroy
them
with
a
mighty
destruction
until
they
be
destroyed
7
24
and
he
shall
deliver
their
kings
into
thine
hand
and
thou
shalt
destroy
their
name
from
under
heaven
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
until
thou
have
destroyed
them
7
25
the
graven
images
of
their
gods
shall
ye
burn
with
fire
thou
shalt
not
desire
the
silver
or
gold
that
is
on
them
nor
take
it
unto
thee
lest
thou
be
snared
therein
for
it
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
thy
god
7
26
neither
shalt
thou
bring
an
abomination
into
thine
house
lest
thou
be
a
cursed
thing
like
it
but
thou
shalt
utterly
detest
it
and
thou
shalt
utterly
abhor
it
for
it
is
a
cursed
thing
8
1
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
ye
observe
to
do
that
ye
may
live
and
multiply
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
8
2
and
thou
shalt
remember
all
the
way
which
the
lord
thy
god
led
thee
these
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
to
humble
thee
and
to
prove
thee
to
know
what
was
in
thine
heart
whether
thou
wouldest
keep
his
commandments
or
no
8
3
and
he
humbled
thee
and
suffered
thee
to
hunger
and
fed
thee
with
manna
which
thou
knewest
not
neither
did
thy
fathers
know
that
he
might
make
thee
know
that
man
doth
not
live
by
bread
only
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lord
doth
man
live
8
4
thy
raiment
waxed
not
old
upon
thee
neither
did
thy
foot
swell
these
forty
years
8
5
thou
shalt
also
consider
in
thine
heart
that
as
a
man
chasteneth
his
son
so
the
lord
thy
god
chasteneth
thee
8
6
therefore
thou
shalt
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
and
to
fear
him
8
7
for
the
lord
thy
god
bringeth
thee
into
a
good
land
a
land
of
brooks
of
water
of
fountains
and
depths
that
spring
out
of
valleys
and
hills
8
8
a
land
of
wheat
and
barley
and
vines
and
fig
trees
and
pomegranates
a
land
of
oil
olive
and
honey
8
9
a
land
wherein
thou
shalt
eat
bread
without
scarceness
thou
shalt
not
lack
any
thing
in
it
a
land
whose
stones
are
iron
and
out
of
whose
hills
thou
mayest
dig
brass
8
10
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full
then
thou
shalt
bless
the
lord
thy
god
for
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
thee
8
11
beware
that
thou
forget
not
the
lord
thy
god
in
not
keeping
his
commandments
and
his
judgments
and
his
statutes
which
i
command
thee
this
day
8
12
lest
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full
and
hast
built
goodly
houses
and
dwelt
therein
8
13
and
when
thy
herds
and
thy
flocks
multiply
and
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
multiplied
and
all
that
thou
hast
is
multiplied
8
14
then
thine
heart
be
lifted
up
and
thou
forget
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
8
15
who
led
thee
through
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness
wherein
were
fiery
serpents
and
scorpions
and
drought
where
there
was
no
water
who
brought
thee
forth
water
out
of
the
rock
of
flint
8
16
who
fed
thee
in
the
wilderness
with
manna
which
thy
fathers
knew
not
that
he
might
humble
thee
and
that
he
might
prove
thee
to
do
thee
good
at
thy
latter
end
8
17
and
thou
say
in
thine
heart
my
power
and
the
might
of
mine
hand
hath
gotten
me
this
wealth
8
18
but
thou
shalt
remember
the
lord
thy
god
for
it
is
he
that
giveth
thee
power
to
get
wealth
that
he
may
establish
his
covenant
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
as
it
is
this
day
8
19
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
thy
god
and
walk
after
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
worship
them
i
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
8
20
as
the
nations
which
the
lord
destroyeth
before
your
face
so
shall
ye
perish
because
ye
would
not
be
obedient
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
9
1
hear
o
israel
thou
art
to
pass
over
jordan
this
day
to
go
in
to
possess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thyself
cities
great
and
fenced
up
to
heaven
9
2
a
people
great
and
tall
the
children
of
the
anakims
whom
thou
knowest
and
of
whom
thou
hast
heard
say
who
can
stand
before
the
children
of
anak
9
3
understand
therefore
this
day
that
the
lord
thy
god
is
he
which
goeth
over
before
thee
as
a
consuming
fire
he
shall
destroy
them
and
he
shall
bring
them
down
before
thy
face
so
shalt
thou
drive
them
out
and
destroy
them
quickly
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thee
9
4
speak
not
thou
in
thine
heart
after
that
the
lord
thy
god
hath
cast
them
out
from
before
thee
saying
for
my
righteousness
the
lord
hath
brought
me
in
to
possess
this
land
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
9
5
not
for
thy
righteousness
or
for
the
uprightness
of
thine
heart
dost
thou
go
to
possess
their
land
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
and
that
he
may
perform
the
word
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
9
6
understand
therefore
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
not
this
good
land
to
possess
it
for
thy
righteousness
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
people
9
7
remember
and
forget
not
how
thou
provokedst
the
lord
thy
god
to
wrath
in
the
wilderness
from
the
day
that
thou
didst
depart
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
until
ye
came
unto
this
place
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
9
8
also
in
horeb
ye
provoked
the
lord
to
wrath
so
that
the
lord
was
angry
with
you
to
have
destroyed
you
9
9
when
i
was
gone
up
into
the
mount
to
receive
the
tables
of
stone
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
which
the
lord
made
with
you
then
i
abode
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
nights
i
neither
did
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
9
10
and
the
lord
delivered
unto
me
two
tables
of
stone
written
with
the
finger
of
god
and
on
them
was
written
according
to
all
the
words
which
the
lord
spake
with
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
9
11
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
forty
days
and
forty
nights
that
the
lord
gave
me
the
two
tables
of
stone
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
9
12
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
get
thee
down
quickly
from
hence
for
thy
people
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
have
corrupted
themselves
they
are
quickly
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
commanded
them
they
have
made
them
a
molten
image
9
13
furthermore
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
i
have
seen
this
people
and
behold
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people
9
14
let
me
alone
that
i
may
destroy
them
and
blot
out
their
name
from
under
heaven
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
nation
mightier
and
greater
than
they
9
15
so
i
turned
and
came
down
from
the
mount
and
the
mount
burned
with
fire
and
the
two
tables
of
the
covenant
were
in
my
two
hands
9
16
and
i
looked
and
behold
ye
had
sinned
against
the
lord
your
god
and
had
made
you
a
molten
calf
ye
had
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
the
lord
had
commanded
you
9
17
and
i
took
the
two
tables
and
cast
them
out
of
my
two
hands
and
brake
them
before
your
eyes
9
18
and
i
fell
down
before
the
lord
as
at
the
first
forty
days
and
forty
nights
i
did
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
because
of
all
your
sins
which
ye
sinned
in
doing
wickedly
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
9
19
for
i
was
afraid
of
the
anger
and
hot
displeasure
wherewith
the
lord
was
wroth
against
you
to
destroy
you
but
the
lord
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also
9
20
and
the
lord
was
very
angry
with
aaron
to
have
destroyed
him
and
i
prayed
for
aaron
also
the
same
time
9
21
and
i
took
your
sin
the
calf
which
ye
had
made
and
burnt
it
with
fire
and
stamped
it
and
ground
it
very
small
even
until
it
was
as
small
as
dust
and
i
cast
the
dust
thereof
into
the
brook
that
descended
out
of
the
mount
9
22
and
at
taberah
and
at
massah
and
at
kibrothhattaavah
ye
provoked
the
lord
to
wrath
9
23
likewise
when
the
lord
sent
you
from
kadeshbarnea
saying
go
up
and
possess
the
land
which
i
have
given
you
then
ye
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
god
and
ye
believed
him
not
nor
hearkened
to
his
voice
9
24
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
from
the
day
that
i
knew
you
9
25
thus
i
fell
down
before
the
lord
forty
days
and
forty
nights
as
i
fell
down
at
the
first
because
the
lord
had
said
he
would
destroy
you
9
26
i
prayed
therefore
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
destroy
not
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
hast
redeemed
through
thy
greatness
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
9
27
remember
thy
servants
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
look
not
unto
the
stubbornness
of
this
people
nor
to
their
wickedness
nor
to
their
sin
9
28
lest
the
land
whence
thou
broughtest
us
out
say
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
them
into
the
land
which
he
promised
them
and
because
he
hated
them
he
hath
brought
them
out
to
slay
them
in
the
wilderness
9
29
yet
they
are
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
broughtest
out
by
thy
mighty
power
and
by
thy
stretched
out
arm
10
1
at
that
time
the
lord
said
unto
me
hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
come
up
unto
me
into
the
mount
and
make
thee
an
ark
of
wood
10
2
and
i
will
write
on
the
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables
which
thou
brakest
and
thou
shalt
put
them
in
the
ark
10
3
and
i
made
an
ark
of
shittim
wood
and
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
went
up
into
the
mount
having
the
two
tables
in
mine
hand
10
4
and
he
wrote
on
the
tables
according
to
the
first
writing
the
ten
commandments
which
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
and
the
lord
gave
them
unto
me
10
5
and
i
turned
myself
and
came
down
from
the
mount
and
put
the
tables
in
the
ark
which
i
had
made
and
there
they
be
as
the
lord
commanded
me
10
6
and
the
children
of
israel
took
their
journey
from
beeroth
of
the
children
of
jaakan
to
mosera
there
aaron
died
and
there
he
was
buried
and
eleazar
his
son
ministered
in
the
priest’s
office
in
his
stead
10
7
from
thence
they
journeyed
unto
gudgodah
and
from
gudgodah
to
jotbath
a
land
of
rivers
of
waters
10
8
at
that
time
the
lord
separated
the
tribe
of
levi
to
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
to
stand
before
the
lord
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
his
name
unto
this
day
10
9
wherefore
levi
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
his
brethren
the
lord
is
his
inheritance
according
as
the
lord
thy
god
promised
him
10
10
and
i
stayed
in
the
mount
according
to
the
first
time
forty
days
and
forty
nights
and
the
lord
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also
and
the
lord
would
not
destroy
thee
10
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
take
thy
journey
before
the
people
that
they
may
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
to
give
unto
them
10
12
and
now
israel
what
doth
the
lord
thy
god
require
of
thee
but
to
fear
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
love
him
and
to
serve
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
10
13
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
his
statutes
which
i
command
thee
this
day
for
thy
good
10
14
behold
the
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
is
the
lord’s
thy
god
the
earth
also
with
all
that
therein
is
10
15
only
the
lord
had
a
delight
in
thy
fathers
to
love
them
and
he
chose
their
seed
after
them
even
you
above
all
people
as
it
is
this
day
10
16
circumcise
therefore
the
foreskin
of
your
heart
and
be
no
more
stiffnecked
10
17
for
the
lord
your
god
is
god
of
gods
and
lord
of
lords
a
great
god
a
mighty
and
a
terrible
which
regardeth
not
persons
nor
taketh
reward
10
18
he
doth
execute
the
judgment
of
the
fatherless
and
widow
and
loveth
the
stranger
in
giving
him
food
and
raiment
10
19
love
ye
therefore
the
stranger
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
egypt
10
20
thou
shalt
fear
the
lord
thy
god
him
shalt
thou
serve
and
to
him
shalt
thou
cleave
and
swear
by
his
name
10
21
he
is
thy
praise
and
he
is
thy
god
that
hath
done
for
thee
these
great
and
terrible
things
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
10
22
thy
fathers
went
down
into
egypt
with
threescore
and
ten
persons
and
now
the
lord
thy
god
hath
made
thee
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude
11
1
therefore
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
keep
his
charge
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
and
his
commandments
alway
11
2
and
know
ye
this
day
for
i
speak
not
with
your
children
which
have
not
known
and
which
have
not
seen
the
chastisement
of
the
lord
your
god
his
greatness
his
mighty
hand
and
his
stretched
out
arm
11
3
and
his
miracles
and
his
acts
which
he
did
in
the
midst
of
egypt
unto
pharaoh
the
king
of
egypt
and
unto
all
his
land
11
4
and
what
he
did
unto
the
army
of
egypt
unto
their
horses
and
to
their
chariots
how
he
made
the
water
of
the
red
sea
to
overflow
them
as
they
pursued
after
you
and
how
the
lord
hath
destroyed
them
unto
this
day
11
5
and
what
he
did
unto
you
in
the
wilderness
until
ye
came
into
this
place
11
6
and
what
he
did
unto
dathan
and
abiram
the
sons
of
eliab
the
son
of
reuben
how
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
them
up
and
their
households
and
their
tents
and
all
the
substance
that
was
in
their
possession
in
the
midst
of
all
israel
11
7
but
your
eyes
have
seen
all
the
great
acts
of
the
lord
which
he
did
11
8
therefore
shall
ye
keep
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
you
this
day
that
ye
may
be
strong
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
11
9
and
that
ye
may
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
11
10
for
the
land
whither
thou
goest
in
to
possess
it
is
not
as
the
land
of
egypt
from
whence
ye
came
out
where
thou
sowedst
thy
seed
and
wateredst
it
with
thy
foot
as
a
garden
of
herbs
11
11
but
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
is
a
land
of
hills
and
valleys
and
drinketh
water
of
the
rain
of
heaven
11
12
a
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
careth
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
thy
god
are
always
upon
it
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
even
unto
the
end
of
the
year
11
13
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
shall
hearken
diligently
unto
my
commandments
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
love
the
lord
your
god
and
to
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
11
14
that
i
will
give
you
the
rain
of
your
land
in
his
due
season
the
first
rain
and
the
latter
rain
that
thou
mayest
gather
in
thy
corn
and
thy
wine
and
thine
oil
11
15
and
i
will
send
grass
in
thy
fields
for
thy
cattle
that
thou
mayest
eat
and
be
full
11
16
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived
and
ye
turn
aside
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
11
17
and
then
the
lord’s
wrath
be
kindled
against
you
and
he
shut
up
the
heaven
that
there
be
no
rain
and
that
the
land
yield
not
her
fruit
and
lest
ye
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
the
lord
giveth
you
11
18
therefore
shall
ye
lay
up
these
my
words
in
your
heart
and
in
your
soul
and
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
your
hand
that
they
may
be
as
frontlets
between
your
eyes
11
19
and
ye
shall
teach
them
your
children
speaking
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
11
20
and
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
door
posts
of
thine
house
and
upon
thy
gates
11
21
that
your
days
may
be
multiplied
and
the
days
of
your
children
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them
as
the
days
of
heaven
upon
the
earth
11
22
for
if
ye
shall
diligently
keep
all
these
commandments
which
i
command
you
to
do
them
to
love
the
lord
your
god
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
cleave
unto
him
11
23
then
will
the
lord
drive
out
all
these
nations
from
before
you
and
ye
shall
possess
greater
nations
and
mightier
than
yourselves
11
24
every
place
whereon
the
soles
of
your
feet
shall
tread
shall
be
yours
from
the
wilderness
and
lebanon
from
the
river
the
river
euphrates
even
unto
the
uttermost
sea
shall
your
coast
be
11
25
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
you
for
the
lord
your
god
shall
lay
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
upon
all
the
land
that
ye
shall
tread
upon
as
he
hath
said
unto
you
11
26
behold
i
set
before
you
this
day
a
blessing
and
a
curse
11
27
a
blessing
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
this
day
11
28
and
a
curse
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
go
after
other
gods
which
ye
have
not
known
11
29
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
brought
thee
in
unto
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
that
thou
shalt
put
the
blessing
upon
mount
gerizim
and
the
curse
upon
mount
ebal
11
30
are
they
not
on
the
other
side
jordan
by
the
way
where
the
sun
goeth
down
in
the
land
of
the
canaanites
which
dwell
in
the
champaign
over
against
gilgal
beside
the
plains
of
moreh
11
31
for
ye
shall
pass
over
jordan
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
you
and
ye
shall
possess
it
and
dwell
therein
11
32
and
ye
shall
observe
to
do
all
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
i
set
before
you
this
day
12
1
these
are
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
ye
shall
observe
to
do
in
the
land
which
the
lord
god
of
thy
fathers
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
all
the
days
that
ye
live
upon
the
earth
12
2
ye
shall
utterly
destroy
all
the
places
wherein
the
nations
which
ye
shall
possess
served
their
gods
upon
the
high
mountains
and
upon
the
hills
and
under
every
green
tree
12
3
and
ye
shall
overthrow
their
altars
and
break
their
pillars
and
burn
their
groves
with
fire
and
ye
shall
hew
down
the
graven
images
of
their
gods
and
destroy
the
names
of
them
out
of
that
place
12
4
ye
shall
not
do
so
unto
the
lord
your
god
12
5
but
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
your
god
shall
choose
out
of
all
your
tribes
to
put
his
name
there
even
unto
his
habitation
shall
ye
seek
and
thither
thou
shalt
come
12
6
and
thither
ye
shall
bring
your
burnt
offerings
and
your
sacrifices
and
your
tithes
and
heave
offerings
of
your
hand
and
your
vows
and
your
freewill
offerings
and
the
firstlings
of
your
herds
and
of
your
flocks
12
7
and
there
ye
shall
eat
before
the
lord
your
god
and
ye
shall
rejoice
in
all
that
ye
put
your
hand
unto
ye
and
your
households
wherein
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
12
8
ye
shall
not
do
after
all
the
things
that
we
do
here
this
day
every
man
whatsoever
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
12
9
for
ye
are
not
as
yet
come
to
the
rest
and
to
the
inheritance
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
you
12
10
but
when
ye
go
over
jordan
and
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
you
to
inherit
and
when
he
giveth
you
rest
from
all
your
enemies
round
about
so
that
ye
dwell
in
safety
12
11
then
there
shall
be
a
place
which
the
lord
your
god
shall
choose
to
cause
his
name
to
dwell
there
thither
shall
ye
bring
all
that
i
command
you
your
burnt
offerings
and
your
sacrifices
your
tithes
and
the
heave
offering
of
your
hand
and
all
your
choice
vows
which
ye
vow
unto
the
lord
12
12
and
ye
shall
rejoice
before
the
lord
your
god
ye
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
and
your
menservants
and
your
maidservants
and
the
levite
that
is
within
your
gates
forasmuch
as
he
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
you
12
13
take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
offer
not
thy
burnt
offerings
in
every
place
that
thou
seest
12
14
but
in
the
place
which
the
lord
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
tribes
there
thou
shalt
offer
thy
burnt
offerings
and
there
thou
shalt
do
all
that
i
command
thee
12
15
notwithstanding
thou
mayest
kill
and
eat
flesh
in
all
thy
gates
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after
according
to
the
blessing
of
the
lord
thy
god
which
he
hath
given
thee
the
unclean
and
the
clean
may
eat
thereof
as
of
the
roebuck
and
as
of
the
hart
12
16
only
ye
shall
not
eat
the
blood
ye
shall
pour
it
upon
the
earth
as
water
12
17
thou
mayest
not
eat
within
thy
gates
the
tithe
of
thy
corn
or
of
thy
wine
or
of
thy
oil
or
the
firstlings
of
thy
herds
or
of
thy
flock
nor
any
of
thy
vows
which
thou
vowest
nor
thy
freewill
offerings
or
heave
offering
of
thine
hand
12
18
but
thou
must
eat
them
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
the
place
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
choose
thou
and
thy
son
and
thy
daughter
and
thy
manservant
and
thy
maidservant
and
the
levite
that
is
within
thy
gates
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
all
that
thou
puttest
thine
hands
unto
12
19
take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
forsake
not
the
levite
as
long
as
thou
livest
upon
the
earth
12
20
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
enlarge
thy
border
as
he
hath
promised
thee
and
thou
shalt
say
i
will
eat
flesh
because
thy
soul
longeth
to
eat
flesh
thou
mayest
eat
flesh
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after
12
21
if
the
place
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
to
put
his
name
there
be
too
far
from
thee
then
thou
shalt
kill
of
thy
herd
and
of
thy
flock
which
the
lord
hath
given
thee
as
i
have
commanded
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
in
thy
gates
whatsoever
thy
soul
lusteth
after
12
22
even
as
the
roebuck
and
the
hart
is
eaten
so
thou
shalt
eat
them
the
unclean
and
the
clean
shall
eat
of
them
alike
12
23
only
be
sure
that
thou
eat
not
the
blood
for
the
blood
is
the
life
and
thou
mayest
not
eat
the
life
with
the
flesh
12
24
thou
shalt
not
eat
it
thou
shalt
pour
it
upon
the
earth
as
water
12
25
thou
shalt
not
eat
it
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
when
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
12
26
only
thy
holy
things
which
thou
hast
and
thy
vows
thou
shalt
take
and
go
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
shall
choose
12
27
and
thou
shalt
offer
thy
burnt
offerings
the
flesh
and
the
blood
upon
the
altar
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
blood
of
thy
sacrifices
shall
be
poured
out
upon
the
altar
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
flesh
12
28
observe
and
hear
all
these
words
which
i
command
thee
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
for
ever
when
thou
doest
that
which
is
good
and
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
12
29
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
cut
off
the
nations
from
before
thee
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
them
and
thou
succeedest
them
and
dwellest
in
their
land
12
30
take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
be
not
snared
by
following
them
after
that
they
be
destroyed
from
before
thee
and
that
thou
enquire
not
after
their
gods
saying
how
did
these
nations
serve
their
gods
even
so
will
i
do
likewise
12
31
thou
shalt
not
do
so
unto
the
lord
thy
god
for
every
abomination
to
the
lord
which
he
hateth
have
they
done
unto
their
gods
for
even
their
sons
and
their
daughters
they
have
burnt
in
the
fire
to
their
gods
12
32
what
thing
soever
i
command
you
observe
to
do
it
thou
shalt
not
add
thereto
nor
diminish
from
it
13
1
if
there
arise
among
you
a
prophet
or
a
dreamer
of
dreams
and
giveth
thee
a
sign
or
a
wonder
13
2
and
the
sign
or
the
wonder
come
to
pass
whereof
he
spake
unto
thee
saying
let
us
go
after
other
gods
which
thou
hast
not
known
and
let
us
serve
them
13
3
thou
shalt
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
that
prophet
or
that
dreamer
of
dreams
for
the
lord
your
god
proveth
you
to
know
whether
ye
love
the
lord
your
god
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
13
4
ye
shall
walk
after
the
lord
your
god
and
fear
him
and
keep
his
commandments
and
obey
his
voice
and
ye
shall
serve
him
and
cleave
unto
him
13
5
and
that
prophet
or
that
dreamer
of
dreams
shall
be
put
to
death
because
he
hath
spoken
to
turn
you
away
from
the
lord
your
god
which
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
to
thrust
thee
out
of
the
way
which
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
thee
to
walk
in
so
shalt
thou
put
the
evil
away
from
the
midst
of
thee
13
6
if
thy
brother
the
son
of
thy
mother
or
thy
son
or
thy
daughter
or
the
wife
of
thy
bosom
or
thy
friend
which
is
as
thine
own
soul
entice
thee
secretly
saying
let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods
which
thou
hast
not
known
thou
nor
thy
fathers
13
7
namely
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you
nigh
unto
thee
or
far
off
from
thee
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth
13
8
thou
shalt
not
consent
unto
him
nor
hearken
unto
him
neither
shall
thine
eye
pity
him
neither
shalt
thou
spare
neither
shalt
thou
conceal
him
13
9
but
thou
shalt
surely
kill
him
thine
hand
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death
and
afterwards
the
hand
of
all
the
people
13
10
and
thou
shalt
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
because
he
hath
sought
to
thrust
thee
away
from
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
13
11
and
all
israel
shall
hear
and
fear
and
shall
do
no
more
any
such
wickedness
as
this
is
among
you
13
12
if
thou
shalt
hear
say
in
one
of
thy
cities
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
to
dwell
there
saying
13
13
certain
men
the
children
of
belial
are
gone
out
from
among
you
and
have
withdrawn
the
inhabitants
of
their
city
saying
let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods
which
ye
have
not
known
13
14
then
shalt
thou
enquire
and
make
search
and
ask
diligently
and
behold
if
it
be
truth
and
the
thing
certain
that
such
abomination
is
wrought
among
you
13
15
thou
shalt
surely
smite
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
destroying
it
utterly
and
all
that
is
therein
and
the
cattle
thereof
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
13
16
and
thou
shalt
gather
all
the
spoil
of
it
into
the
midst
of
the
street
thereof
and
shalt
burn
with
fire
the
city
and
all
the
spoil
thereof
every
whit
for
the
lord
thy
god
and
it
shall
be
an
heap
for
ever
it
shall
not
be
built
again
13
17
and
there
shall
cleave
nought
of
the
cursed
thing
to
thine
hand
that
the
lord
may
turn
from
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
and
shew
thee
mercy
and
have
compassion
upon
thee
and
multiply
thee
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers
13
18
when
thou
shalt
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
all
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
thy
god
14
1
ye
are
the
children
of
the
lord
your
god
ye
shall
not
cut
yourselves
nor
make
any
baldness
between
your
eyes
for
the
dead
14
2
for
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
lord
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
peculiar
people
unto
himself
above
all
the
nations
that
are
upon
the
earth
14
3
thou
shalt
not
eat
any
abominable
thing
14
4
these
are
the
beasts
which
ye
shall
eat
the
ox
the
sheep
and
the
goat
14
5
the
hart
and
the
roebuck
and
the
fallow
deer
and
the
wild
goat
and
the
pygarg
and
the
wild
ox
and
the
chamois
14
6
and
every
beast
that
parteth
the
hoof
and
cleaveth
the
cleft
into
two
claws
and
cheweth
the
cud
among
the
beasts
that
ye
shall
eat
14
7
nevertheless
these
ye
shall
not
eat
of
them
that
chew
the
cud
or
of
them
that
divide
the
cloven
hoof
as
the
camel
and
the
hare
and
the
coney
for
they
chew
the
cud
but
divide
not
the
hoof
therefore
they
are
unclean
unto
you
14
8
and
the
swine
because
it
divideth
the
hoof
yet
cheweth
not
the
cud
it

blesseth
thee
as

giveth
thee

sufficient
for

which

and
thine
eye
be
evil
against
thy
poor
brother
and
thou
givest
him
nought
and
he
cry
unto
the
lord
against
thee
and
it
be
sin
unto
thee
15
10
thou
shalt
surely
give
him
and
thine
heart
shall
not
be
grieved
when
thou
givest
unto
him
because
that
for
this
thing
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bless
thee
in
all
thy
works
and
in
all
that
thou
puttest
thine
hand
unto
15
11
for
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
land
therefore
i
command
thee
saying

shalt
open
thine
hand
wide
unto
thy
brother
to
thy
poor
and
to
thy
needy
in
thy
land
15
12
and
if
thy
brother
an
hebrew
man
or
an
hebrew
woman
be
sold
unto
thee
and
serve
thee
six
years
then
in
the
seventh

thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee
15
13
and
when

sendest
him
out

thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
lord
thy
god
redeemed
thee
therefore
i
command
thee
this
thing
to
day
15
16
and
it
shall
be
if
he
say
unto
thee
i
will
not
go
away
from
thee
because
he
loveth
thee
and
thine
house
because
he
is
well
with
thee
15
17
then
thou
shalt
take
an
aul
and
thrust
it
through
his
ear
unto
the
door
and
he
shall
be
thy
servant
for
ever
and
also
unto

do
likewise
15
18
it
shall
not
seem
hard
unto
thee
when
thou
sendest
him
away
free
from
thee
for
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
to
thee
in
serving
thee
six
years
and
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bless
thee
in

shall
choose
one
from
among
thy
brethren
shalt
thou
set
king
over
thee
thou
mayest
not
set
a
stranger
over
thee
which
is
not
thy
brother
17
16
but
he
shall
not
multiply
horses
to
himself
nor
cause
the
people
to
return
to
egypt
to
the
end
that
he
should
multiply
horses
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
you
ye
shall
henceforth
return
no
more
that
way
17
17
neither
shall
he
multiply
wives
to
himself
that
his
heart
turn
not
away
neither
shall
he
greatly
multiply
to
himself
silver
and
gold
17
18
and
it
shall
be
when
he
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
that
he
shall
write
him
a
copy
of
this
law
in
a
book
out
of
that
which
is
before
the
priests
the
levites
17
19
and
it
shall
be
with
him
and
he
shall
read
therein
all
the
days
of
his
life
that
he
may
learn
to
fear
the
lord
his
god
to
keep
all
the
words
of
this
law
and
these
statutes
to
do
them
17
20
that
his
heart
be
not
lifted
up
above
his
brethren
and
that
he
turn
not
aside
from
the
commandment
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
to
the
end
that
he
may
prolong
his
days
in
his
kingdom
he
and
his
children
in
the
midst
of
israel
18
1
the
priests
the
levites
and
all
the
tribe
of
levi
shall
have
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
israel
they
shall
eat
the
offerings
of
the
lord
made
by
fire
and
his
inheritance
18
2
therefore
shall
they
have
no
inheritance
among
their
brethren
the
lord
is
their
inheritance
as
he
hath
said
unto
them
18
3
and
this
shall
be
the
priest’s
due
from
the
people
from
them
that
offer
a
sacrifice
whether
it
be
ox
or
sheep
and
they
shall
give
unto
the
priest
the
shoulder
and
the
two
cheeks
and
the
maw
18
4
the
firstfruit
also
of
thy
corn
of
thy
wine
and
of
thine
oil
and
the
first
of
the
fleece
of
thy
sheep
shalt
thou
give
him
18
5
for
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
him
out
of
all
thy
tribes
to
stand
to
minister
in
the
name
of
the
lord
him
and
his
sons
for
ever
18
6
and
if
a
levite
come
from
any
of
thy
gates
out
of
all
israel
where
he
sojourned
and
come
with
all
the
desire
of
his
mind
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
shall
choose
18
7
then
he
shall
minister
in
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
as
all
his
brethren
the
levites
do
which
stand
there
before
the
lord
18
8
they
shall
have
like
portions
to
eat
beside
that
which
cometh
of
the
sale
of
his
patrimony
18
9
when
thou
art
come
into
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
thou
shalt
not
learn
to
do
after
the
abominations
of
those
nations
18
10
there
shall
not
be
found
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
or
that
useth
divination
or
an
observer
of
times
or
an
enchanter
or
a
witch
18
11
or
a
charmer
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirits
or
a
wizard
or
a
necromancer
18
12
for
all
that
do
these
things
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
because
of
these
abominations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
18
13
thou
shalt
be
perfect
with
the
lord
thy
god
18
14
for
these
nations
which
thou
shalt
possess
hearkened
unto
observers
of
times
and
unto
diviners
but
as
for
thee
the
lord
thy
god
hath
not
suffered
thee
so
to
do
18
15
the
lord
thy
god
will
raise
up
unto
thee
a
prophet
from
the
midst
of
thee
of
thy
brethren
like
unto
me
unto
him
ye
shall
hearken
18
16
according
to
all
that
thou
desiredst
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
horeb
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
saying
let
me
not
hear
again
the
voice
of
the
lord
my
god
neither
let
me
see
this
great
fire
any
more
that
i
die
not
18
17
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
they
have
well
spoken
that
which
they
have
spoken
18
18
i
will
raise
them
up
a
prophet
from
among
their
brethren
like
unto
thee
and
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth
and
he
shall
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
shall
command
him
18
19
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
will
not
hearken
unto
my
words
which
he
shall
speak
in
my
name
i
will
require
it
of
him
18
20
but
the
prophet
which
shall
presume
to
speak
a
word
in
my
name
which
i
have
not
commanded
him
to
speak
or
that
shall
speak
in
the
name
of
other
gods
even
that
prophet
shall
die
18
21
and
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart
how
shall
we
know
the
word
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
18
22
when
a
prophet
speaketh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
if
the
thing
follow
not
nor
come
to
pass
that
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
but
the
prophet
hath
spoken
it
presumptuously
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
him
19
1
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
cut
off
the
nations
whose
land
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
and
thou
succeedest
them
and
dwellest
in
their
cities
and
in
their
houses
19
2
thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee
in
the
midst
of
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
19
3
thou
shalt
prepare
thee
a
way
and
divide
the
coasts
of
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
inherit
into
three
parts
that
every
slayer
may
flee
thither
19
4
and
this
is
the
case
of
the
slayer
which
shall
flee
thither
that
he
may
live
whoso
killeth
his
neighbour
ignorantly
whom
he
hated
not
in
time
past
19
5
as
when
a
man
goeth
into
the
wood
with
his
neighbour
to
hew
wood
and
his
hand
fetcheth
a
stroke
with
the
axe
to
cut
down
the
tree
and
the
head
slippeth
from
the
helve
and
lighteth
upon
his
neighbour
that
he
die
he
shall
flee
unto
one
of
those
cities
and
live
19
6
lest
the
avenger
of
the
blood
pursue
the
slayer
while
his
heart
is
hot
and
overtake
him
because
the
way
is
long
and
slay
him
whereas
he
was
not
worthy
of
death
inasmuch
as
he
hated
him
not
in
time
past
19
7
wherefore
i
command
thee
saying
thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee
19
8
and
if
the
lord
thy
god
enlarge
thy
coast
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers
and
give
thee
all
the
land
which
he
promised
to
give
unto
thy
fathers
19
9
if
thou
shalt
keep
all
these
commandments
to
do
them
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
to
walk
ever
in
his
ways
then
shalt
thou
add
three
cities
more
for
thee
beside
these
three
19
10
that
innocent
blood
be
not
shed
in
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
and
so
blood
be
upon
thee
19
11
but
if
any
man
hate
his
neighbour
and
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
rise
up
against
him
and
smite
him
mortally
that
he
die
and
fleeth
into
one
of
these
cities
19
12
then
the
elders
of
his
city
shall
send
and
fetch
him
thence
and
deliver
him
into
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood
that
he
may
die
19
13
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
him
but
thou
shalt
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
israel
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
19
14
thou
shalt
not
remove
thy
neighbour’s
landmark
which
they
of
old
time
have
set
in
thine
inheritance
which
thou
shalt
inherit
in
the
land
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
19
15
one
witness
shall
not
rise
up
against
a
man
for
any
iniquity
or
for
any
sin
in
any
sin
that
he
sinneth
at
the
mouth
of
two
witnesses
or
at
the
mouth
of
three
witnesses
shall
the
matter
be
established
19
16
if
a
false
witness
rise
up
against
any
man
to
testify
against
him
that
which
is
wrong
19
17
then
both
the
men
between
whom
the
controversy
is
shall
stand
before
the
lord
before
the
priests
and
the
judges
which
shall
be
in
those
days
19
18
and
the
judges
shall
make
diligent
inquisition
and
behold
if
the
witness
be
a
false
witness
and
hath
testified
falsely
against
his
brother
19
19
then
shall
ye
do
unto
him
as
he
had
thought
to
have
done
unto
his
brother
so
shalt
thou
put
the
evil
away
from
among
you
19
20
and
those
which
remain
shall
hear
and
fear
and
shall
henceforth
commit
no
more
any
such
evil
among
you
19
21
and
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
but
life
shall
go
for
life
eye
for
eye
tooth
for
tooth
hand
for
hand
foot
for
foot
20
1
when
thou
goest
out
to
battle
against
thine
enemies
and
seest
horses
and
chariots
and
a
people
more
than
thou
be
not
afraid
of
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
with
thee
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
20
2
and
it
shall
be
when
ye
are
come
nigh
unto
the
battle
that
the
priest
shall
approach
and
speak
unto
the
people
20
3
and
shall
say
unto
them
hear
o
israel
ye
approach
this
day
unto
battle
against
your
enemies
let
not
your
hearts
faint
fear
not
and
do
not
tremble
neither
be
ye
terrified
because
of
them
20
4
for
the
lord
your
god
is
he
that
goeth
with
you
to
fight
for
you
against
your
enemies
to
save
you
20
5
and
the
officers
shall
speak
unto
the
people
saying
what
man
is
there
that
hath
built
a
new
house
and
hath
not
dedicated
it
let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
dedicate
it
20
6
and
what
man
is
he
that
hath
planted
a
vineyard
and
hath
not
yet
eaten
of
it
let
him
also
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
eat
of
it
20
7
and
what
man
is
there
that
hath
betrothed
a
wife
and
hath
not
taken
her
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
take
her
20
8
and
the
officers
shall
speak
further
unto
the
people
and
they
shall
say
what
man
is
there
that
is
fearful
and
fainthearted
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
his
brethren’s
heart
faint
as
well
as
his
heart
20
9
and
it
shall
be
when
the
officers
have
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
that
they
shall
make
captains
of
the
armies
to
lead
the
people
20
10
when
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it
20
11
and
it
shall
be
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace
and
open
unto
thee
then
it
shall
be
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
be
tributaries
unto
thee
and
they
shall
serve
thee
20
12
and
if
it
will
make
no
peace
with
thee
but
will
make
war
against
thee
then
thou
shalt
besiege
it
20
13
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
it
into
thine
hands
thou
shalt
smite
every
male
thereof
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
20
14
but
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
cattle
and
all
that
is
in
the
city
even
all
the
spoil
thereof
shalt
thou
take
unto
thyself
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
spoil
of
thine
enemies
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
20
15
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
very
far
off
from
thee
which
are
not
of
the
cities
of
these
nations
20
16
but
of
the
cities
of
these
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
doth
give
thee
for
an
inheritance
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
20
17
but
thou
shalt
utterly
destroy
them
namely
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
20
18
that
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
done
unto
their
gods
so
should
ye
sin
against
the
lord
your
god
20
19
when
thou
shalt
besiege
a
city
a
long
time
in
making
war
against
it
to
take
it
thou
shalt
not
destroy
the
trees
thereof
by
forcing
an
axe
against
them
for
thou
mayest
eat
of
them
and
thou
shalt
not
cut
them
down
(for
the
tree
of
the
field
is
man’s
life)
to
employ
them
in
the
siege
20
20
only
the
trees
which
thou
knowest
that
they
be
not
trees
for
meat
thou
shalt
destroy
and
cut
them
down
and
thou
shalt
build
bulwarks
against
the
city
that
maketh
war
with
thee
until
it
be
subdued
21
1
if
one
be
found
slain
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
lying
in
the
field
and
it
be
not
known
who
hath
slain
him
21
2
then
thy
elders
and
thy
judges
shall
come
forth
and
they
shall
measure
unto
the
cities
which
are
round
about
him
that
is
slain
21
3
and
it
shall
be
that
the
city
which
is
next
unto
the
slain
man
even
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
an
heifer
which
hath
not
been
wrought
with
and
which
hath
not
drawn
in
the
yoke
21
4
and
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
bring
down
the
heifer
unto
a
rough
valley
which
is
neither
eared
nor
sown
and
shall
strike
off
the
heifer’s
neck
there
in
the
valley
21
5
and
the
priests
the
sons
of
levi
shall
come
near
for
them
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
by
their
word
shall
every
controversy
and
every
stroke
be
tried
21
6
and
all
the
elders
of
that
city
that
are
next
unto
the
slain
man
shall
wash
their
hands
over
the
heifer
that
is
beheaded
in
the
valley
21
7
and
they
shall
answer
and
say
our
hands
have
not
shed
this
blood
neither
have
our
eyes
seen
it
21
8
be
merciful
o
lord
unto
thy
people
israel
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
and
lay
not
innocent
blood
unto
thy
people
of
israel’s
charge
and
the
blood
shall
be
forgiven
them
21
9
so
shalt
thou
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
among
you
when
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
21
10
when
thou
goest
forth
to
war
against
thine
enemies
and
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
them
into
thine
hands
and
thou
hast
taken
them
captive
21
11
and
seest
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman
and
hast
a
desire
unto
her
that
thou
wouldest
have
her
to
thy
wife
21
12
then
thou
shalt
bring
her
home
to
thine
house
and
she
shall
shave
her
head
and
pare
her
nails
21
13
and
she
shall
put
the
raiment
of
her
captivity
from
off
her
and
shall
remain
in
thine

after
that
thou
shalt
go
in
unto
her
and
be
her
husband
and
she
shall
be
thy
wife
21
14
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
have
no
delight
in
her
then
thou

let
her
go
whither
she
will
but
thou
shalt
not
sell
her
at
all
for
money
thou
shalt
not
make
merchandise
of
her
because
thou
hast
humbled
her
21
15
if
a
man
have
two
wives
one
beloved
and
another
hated
and
they
have
born
him
children
both
the
beloved
and
the
hated
and
if
the
firstborn
son
be
hers
that
was
hated
21
16
then
it
shall
be
when
he
maketh
his
sons
to
inherit
that
which
he
hath
that
he
may
not
make
the
son
of
the
beloved
firstborn
before
the
son
of
the
hated
which
is
indeed
the
firstborn
21
17
but
he
shall
acknowledge
the
son
of
the
hated
for
the
firstborn
by
giving
him
a
double
portion
of
all
that
he
hath
for
he
is
the
beginning
of
his
strength
the
right
of
the
firstborn
is
his
21
18
if
a
man
have
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
son
which
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
his

the
voice
of
his
mother
and
that
when
they
have
chastened
him
will
not
hearken
unto
them
21
19
then
shall
his
father
and
his
mother
lay
hold
on
him
and
bring
him
out
unto
the
elders
of
his
city
and
unto
the
gate
of
his
place
21
20
and
they
shall
say
unto
the
elders
of
his
city
this
our
son
is
stubborn
and
rebellious
he
will
not
obey
our
voice
he
is
a
glutton
and
a
drunkard
21
21
and
all
the
men
of
his
city
shall
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you
and
all
israel
shall
hear
and
fear
21
22
and
if
a

have
committed
a
sin
worthy
of

and
thou
hang
him
on
a
tree
21
23
his
body
shall
not
remain
all
night
upon
the
tree
but
thou
shalt
in

wise
bury
him
that
day
(for
he
that

hanged
is
accursed
of

)
that
thy

defiled
which
the

thy

giveth
thee
for

thou

with
thee
until
thy

seek
after
it
and
thou
shalt
restore
it
to
him
again
22

in
like
manner
shalt
thou
do
with
his
ass
and
so
shalt
thou
do
with
his
raiment
and
with
all
lost
thing
of
thy
brother’s
which
he
hath
lost
and
thou
hast
found
shalt
thou
do
likewise
thou
mayest
not
hide
thyself
22
4
thou
shalt
not
see
thy
brother’s
ass
or
his
ox
fall
down
by
the
way
and
hide
thyself
from
them
thou
shalt
surely
help
him
to
lift
them
up
again
22
5
the
woman
shall
not
wear
that
which
pertaineth
unto
a
man
neither
shall
a
man
put
on
a
woman’s
garment
for
all
that
do
so
are
abomination
unto
the
lord
thy

22

if
a
bird’s
nest
chance
to
be
before
thee
in
the
way
in

tree
or
on
the
ground
whether
they
be
young
ones

and
the
dam
sitting
upon
the
young
or
upon
the
eggs
thou
shalt
not
take
the
dam
with
the
young
22
7
but
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
let
the
dam
go
and
take
the
young
to
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days
22
8
when
thou
buildest
a
new
house
then
thou
shalt
make
a
battlement
for
thy
roof
that
thou
bring
not
blood
upon
thine
house
if
any
man
fall
from
thence
22
9
thou
shalt
not
sow
thy
vineyard
with
divers
seeds
lest
the
fruit
of
thy
seed
which
thou
hast
sown
and
the
fruit

be
defiled
22

thou

thou

together
22
12
thou
shalt
make
thee
fringes
upon
the
four
quarters
of
thy
vesture
wherewith
thou
coverest
thyself
22
13
if
any
man
take
a
wife
and
go
in
unto
her
and
hate
her
22
14
and
give
occasions
of
speech
against
her
and
bring
up
an
evil
name
upon
her
and
say
i
took
this
woman
and
when
i
came
to
her
i
found
her
not
a
maid
22
15
then
shall
the
father
of
the
damsel
and
her
mother
take
and
bring
forth
the
tokens
of
the
damsel’s
virginity
unto
the
elders
of
the
city
in
the
gate
22
16
and
the
damsel’s
father
shall
say
unto
the
elders
i
gave
my
daughter
unto
this
man
to
wife
and
he
hateth
her
22
17
and
lo
he
hath
given
occasions
of
speech
against
her
saying
i
found
not
thy
daughter
a
maid
and
yet
these
are
the
tokens
of
my
daughter’s
virginity
and
they
shall
spread
the
cloth
before
the
elders
of
the
city
22
18
and
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
that
man
and
chastise
him
22
19
and
they
shall
amerce
him
in
an
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
give
them
unto
the
father
of
the
damsel
because
he
hath
brought
up
an
evil
name
upon
a
virgin
of
israel
and
she
shall
be
his
wife
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days
22
20
but
if
this
thing
be
true
and
the
tokens
of
virginity
be
not
found
for
the
damsel
22
21
then
they
shall
bring
out
the
damsel
to
the
door
of
her
father’s
house
and
the
men
of
her
city
shall
stone
her
with
stones
that
she
die
because
she
hath
wrought
folly
in
israel
to
play
the
whore
in
her
father’s
house
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you
22
22
if
a
man
be
found
lying
with
a
woman
married
to
an
husband
then
they
shall
both
of
them
die
both
the
man
that
lay
with
the
woman
and
the
woman
so
shalt
thou
put
away
evil
from
israel
22
23
if
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
be
betrothed
unto
an
husband
and
a
man
find
her
in
the
city
and
lie
with
her
22
24
then
ye
shall
bring
them
both
out
unto
the
gate
of
that
city
and
ye
shall
stone
them
with
stones
that
they
die
the
damsel
because
she
cried
not
being
in
the
city
and
the
man
because
he
hath
humbled
his
neighbour’s
wife
so
thou
shalt
put
away
evil
from
among
you
22
25
but
if
a
man
find
a
betrothed
damsel
in
the
field
and
the
man
force
her
and
lie
with
her
then
the
man
only
that
lay
with
her
shall
die
22
26
but
unto
the
damsel
thou
shalt
do
nothing
there
is
in
the
damsel
no
sin
worthy
of
death
for
as
when
a
man
riseth
against
his
neighbour
and
slayeth
him
even
so
is
this
matter
22
27
for
he
found
her
in
the
field
and
the
betrothed
damsel
cried
and
there
was
none
to
save
her
22
28
if
a
man
find
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
which
is
not
betrothed
and
lay
hold
on
her
and
lie
with
her
and
they
be
found
22
29
then
the
man
that
lay
with
her
shall
give
unto
the
damsel’s
father
fifty
shekels
of
silver
and
she
shall
be
his
wife
because
he
hath
humbled
her
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days
22
30
a
man
shall
not
take
his
father’s
wife
nor
discover
his
father’s
skirt
23
1
he
that
is
wounded
in
the
stones
or
hath
his
privy
member
cut
off
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
23
2
a
bastard
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
even
to
his
tenth
generation
shall
he
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the

23
3
an
ammonite
or
moabite
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
even
to
their
tenth
generation
shall
they
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
for
ever
23
4
because
they
met
you
not
with
bread
and
with
water
in
the
way
when
ye
came
forth
out
of
egypt
and
because
they
hired
against
thee
balaam
the
son
of
beor
of
pethor
of
mesopotamia
to
curse
thee
23
5
nevertheless
the
lord
thy
god
would
not
hearken
unto
balaam
but
the
lord
thy
god
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing
unto
thee
because
the
lord
thy
god
loved
thee
23
6
thou
shalt
not
seek
their
peace
nor
their
prosperity
all
thy
days
for
ever
23
7
thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
edomite
for
he
is
thy
brother
thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
egyptian
because
thou
wast
a
stranger
in
his
land
23
8
the
children
that
are
begotten
of
them
shall
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
in
their
third
generation
23
9
when
the
host
goeth
forth
against
thine
enemies
then
keep
thee
from
every
wicked
thing
23
10
if
there
be
among
you
any
man
that
is
not
clean
by
reason
of
uncleanness
that
chanceth
him
by
night
then
shall
he
go
abroad
out
of
the
camp
he
shall
not
come
within
the
camp
23
11
but
it
shall
be
when
evening
cometh
on
he
shall
wash
himself
with
water
and
when
the
sun
is
down
he
shall
come
into
the
camp
again
23
12
thou
shalt
have
a
place
also
without
the
camp
whither
thou
shalt
go
forth
abroad
23
13
and
thou
shalt
have
a
paddle
upon
thy
weapon
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
wilt
ease
thyself
abroad
thou
shalt
dig
therewith
and
shalt
turn
back
and
cover
that
which
cometh
from
thee
23
14
for
the
lord
thy
god
walketh
in
the
midst
of
thy
camp
to
deliver
thee
and
to
give
up
thine
enemies
before
thee
therefore
shall
thy
camp
be
holy
that
he
see
no
unclean
thing
in
thee
and
turn
away
from
thee
23
15
thou
shalt
not
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
which
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
23
16
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shalt
not
oppress
him
23
17
there
shall
be
no
whore
of
the
daughters
of
israel
nor
a
sodomite
of
the
sons
of
israel
23
18
thou
shalt
not
bring
the
hire
of
a
whore
or
the
price
of
a
dog
into
the
house
of
the
lord
thy
god
for
any
vow
for
even
both
these
are
abomination
unto
the
lord
thy
god
23
19
thou
shalt
not
lend
upon
usury
to
thy
brother
usury
of
money
usury
of
victuals
usury
of
any
thing
that
is
lent
upon
usury
23
20
unto
a
stranger
thou
mayest
lend
upon
usury
but
unto
thy
brother
thou
shalt
not
lend
upon
usury
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
bless
thee
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine
hand
to
in
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
23
21
when
thou
shalt
vow
a
vow
unto
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
slack
to
pay
it
for
the
lord
thy
god
will
surely
require
it
of
thee
and
it
would
be
sin
in
thee
23
22
but
if
thou
shalt
forbear
to
vow
it
shall
be
no
sin
in
thee
23
23
that
which
is
gone
out
of
thy
lips
thou
shalt
keep
and
perform
even
a
freewill
offering
according
as
thou
hast
vowed
unto
the
lord
thy
god
which
thou
hast
promised
with
thy
mouth
23
24
when
thou
comest
into
thy
neighbour’s
vineyard
then
thou
mayest
eat
grapes
thy
fill
at
thine
own
pleasure
but
thou
shalt
not
put
any
in
thy
vessel
23
25
when
thou
comest
into
the
standing
corn
of
thy
neighbour
then
thou
mayest
pluck
the
ears
with
thine
hand
but
thou
shalt
not
move
a
sickle
unto
thy
neighbour’s
standing
corn

the
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin
24
17
thou
shalt
not
pervert
the
judgment
of
the
stranger
nor
of
the
fatherless
nor
take
a
widow’s
raiment
to
pledge
24
18
but
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
egypt
and
the
lord
thy
god
redeemed
thee
thence
therefore
i
command
thee
to
do
this
thing
24
19
when
thou
cuttest
down
thine
harvest
in
thy
field
and
hast
forgot
a
sheaf
in
the
field
thou
shalt
not
go
again
to
fetch
it
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
bless
thee
in
all
the
work
of
thine
hands
24
20
when
thou
beatest
thine
olive
tree
thou
shalt
not
go
over
the
boughs
again
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
24
21
when
thou
gatherest
the
grapes
of
thy
vineyard
thou
shalt
not
glean
it
afterward
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
24
22
and
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
egypt
therefore
i
command
thee
to
do
this
thing
25
1
if
there
be
a
controversy
between
men
and
they
come
unto
judgment
that
the
judges
may
judge
them
then
they
shall
justify
the
righteous
and
condemn
the
wicked
25
2
and
it
shall
be
if
the
wicked
man
be
worthy
to
be
beaten
that
the
judge
shall
cause
him
to
lie
down
and
to
be
beaten
before
his
face
according
to
his
fault
by
a
certain
number
25
3
forty
stripes
he
may
give
him
and
not
exceed
lest
if
he
should
exceed
and
beat
him
above
these
with
many
stripes
then
thy
brother
should
seem
vile
unto
thee
25
4
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
when
he
treadeth
out
the
corn
25
5
if
brethren
dwell
together
and
one
of
them
die
and
have
no
child
the
wife
of
the
dead
shall
not
marry
without
unto
a
stranger
her
husband’s
brother
shall
go
in
unto
her
and
take
her
to
him
to
wife
and
perform
the
duty
of
an
husband’s
brother
unto
her
25
6
and
it
shall
be
that
the
firstborn
which
she
beareth
shall
succeed
in
the
name
of
his
brother
which
is
dead
that
his
name
be
not
put
out
of
israel
25
7
and
if
the
man
like
not
to
take
his
brother’s
wife
then
let
his
brother’s
wife
go
up
to
the
gate
unto
the
elders
and
say
my
husband’s
brother
refuseth
to
raise
up
unto
his
brother
a
name
in
israel
he
will
not
perform
the
duty
of
my
husband’s
brother
25
8
then
the
elders
of
his
city
shall
call
him
and
speak
unto
him
and
if
he
stand
to
it
and
say
i
like
not
to
take
her
25
9
then
shall
his
brother’s
wife
come
unto
him
in
the
presence
of
the
elders
and
loose
his
shoe
from
off
his
foot
and
spit
in
his
face
and
shall
answer
and
say
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
that
man
that
will
not
build
up
his
brother’s
house
25
10
and
his
name
shall
be
called
in
israel
the
house
of
him
that
hath
his
shoe
loosed
25
11
when
men
strive
together
one
with
another
and
the
wife
of
the
one
draweth
near
for
to
deliver
her
husband
out
of
the
hand
of
him
that
smiteth
him
and
putteth
forth
her
hand
and
taketh
him
by
the
secrets
25
12
then
thou
shalt
cut
off
her
hand
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
her
25
13
thou
shalt
not
have
in
thy
bag
divers
weights
a
great
and
a
small
25
14
thou
shalt
not
have
in
thine
house
divers
measures
a
great
and
a
small
25
15
but
thou
shalt
have
a
perfect
and
just
weight
a
perfect
and
just
measure
shalt
thou
have
that
thy
days
may
be
lengthened
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
25
16
for
all
that
do
such
things
and
all
that
do
unrighteously
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
thy
god
25
17
remember
what
amalek
did
unto
thee
by
the
way
when
ye
were
come
forth
out
of
egypt
25
18
how
he
met
thee
by
the
way
and
smote
the
hindmost
of
thee
even
all
that
were
feeble
behind
thee
when
thou
wast
faint
and
weary
and
he
feared
not
god
25
19
therefore
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
round
about
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
to
possess
it
that
thou
shalt
blot
out
the
remembrance
of
amalek
from
under
heaven
thou
shalt
not
forget
it
26
1
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
art
come
in
unto
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
and
possessest
it
and
dwellest
therein
26
2
that
thou
shalt
take
of
the
first
of
all
the
fruit
of
the
earth
which
thou
shalt
bring
of
thy
land
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
and
shalt
put
it
in
a
basket
and
shalt
go
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
there
26
3
and
thou
shalt
go
unto
the
priest
that
shall
be
in
those
days
and
say
unto
him
i
profess
this
day
unto
the
lord
thy
god
that
i
am
come
unto
the
country
which
the
lord
sware
unto
our
fathers
for
to
give
us
26
4
and
the
priest
shall
take
the
basket
out
of
thine
hand
and
set
it
down
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
thy
god
26
5
and
thou
shalt
speak
and
say
before
the
lord
thy
god
a
syrian
ready
to
perish
was
my
father
and
he
went
down
into
egypt
and
sojourned
there
with
a
few
and
became
there
a
nation
great
mighty
and
populous
26
6
and
the
egyptians
evil
entreated
us
and
afflicted
us
and
laid
upon
us
hard
bondage
26
7
and
when
we
cried
unto
the
lord
god
of
our
fathers
the
lord
heard
our
voice
and
looked
on
our
affliction
and
our
labour
and
our
oppression
26
8
and
the
lord
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
great
terribleness
and
with
signs
and
with
wonders
26
9
and
he
hath
brought
us
into
this
place
and
hath
given
us
this
land
even
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
26
10
and
now
behold
i
have
brought
the
firstfruits
of
the
land
which
thou
o
lord
hast
given
me
and
thou
shalt
set
it
before
the
lord
thy
god
and
worship
before
the
lord
thy
god
26
11
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
every
good
thing
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
unto
thee
and
unto
thine
house
thou
and
the
levite
and
the
stranger
that
is
among
you
26
12
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
tithing
all
the
tithes
of
thine
increase
the
third
year
which
is
the
year
of
tithing
and
hast
given
it
unto
the
levite
the
stranger
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
that
they
may
eat
within
thy
gates
and
be
filled
26
13
then
thou
shalt
say
before
the
lord
thy
god
i
have
brought
away
the
hallowed
things
out
of
mine
house
and
also
have
given
them
unto
the
levite
and
unto
the
stranger
to
the
fatherless
and
to
the
widow
according
to
all
thy
commandments
which
thou
hast
commanded
me
i
have
not
transgressed
thy
commandments
neither
have
i
forgotten
them
26
14
i
have
not
eaten
thereof
in
my
mourning
neither
have
i
taken
away
ought
thereof
for
any
unclean
use
nor
given
ought
thereof
for
the
dead
but
i
have
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
the
lord
my
god
and
have
done
according
to
all
that
thou
hast
commanded
me
26
15
look
down
from
thy
holy
habitation
from
heaven
and
bless
thy
people
israel
and
the
land
which
thou
hast
given
us
as
thou
swarest
unto
our
fathers
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
26
16
this
day
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
to
do
these

thou
shalt
therefore
keep

thine
heart
and

thy
soul
26
17
thou

shouldest
keep
all

and
to
make
thee
high
above
all
nations
which
he
hath
made
in
praise
and
in
name
and
in
honour
and
that
thou
mayest
be
an
holy
people
unto

thou
hearken
unto
the

of
the
lord
thy
god
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
observe
and
to
do
them
28
14
and
thou
shalt
not
go
aside
from
any
of
the
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
to
go
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
28
15
but
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
thou
wilt
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
observe
to
do
all
his
commandments

his
statutes
which

thee
this
day
that
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee
and
overtake
thee
28

cursed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
city
and
cursed
shalt
thou
be
in
the
field
28
17
cursed
shall
be
thy
basket
and
thy
store
28
18
cursed
shall
be
the
fruit
of
thy
body
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land
the
increase
of
thy
kine
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep
28
19
cursed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
comest
in
and
cursed
shalt
thou
be
when
thou
goest
out
28
20
the
lord
shall
send
upon
thee
cursing
vexation
and
rebuke
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine
hand
unto
for
to
do
until
thou
be
destroyed
and
until
thou
perish
quickly
because
of
the
wickedness
of
thy
doings
whereby
thou
hast
forsaken
me
28
21
the
lord
shall
make
the
pestilence
cleave
unto
thee
until
he
have
consumed
thee
from
off
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
28
22
the
lord
shall
smite
thee
with
a
consumption
and
with
a
fever
and
with
an
inflammation
and
with
an
extreme
burning
and
with
the
sword
and
with
blasting
and
with
mildew
and
they
shall
pursue
thee
until
thou
perish
28
23
and
thy
heaven
that
is
over
thy
head
shall
be
brass
and
the
earth
that
is
under
thee
shall
be
iron
28
24
the
lord
shall
make
the
rain
of
thy
land
powder
and
dust
from
heaven
shall
it
come
down
upon
thee
until
thou
be
destroyed
28
25
the
lord
shall
cause
thee
to
be
smitten
before
thine
enemies
thou
shalt
go
out
one
way
against
them
and
flee
seven
ways
before
them
and
shalt
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
28
26
and
thy
carcase
shall
be
meat
unto
all
fowls
of
the
air
and
unto
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
no
man
shall
fray
them
away
28
27
the
lord
will
smite
thee
with
the
botch
of
egypt
and
with
the
emerods
and
with
the
scab
and
with
the
itch
whereof
thou
canst
not
be
healed
28
28
the
lord
shall
smite
thee
with
madness
and
blindness
and
astonishment
of
heart
28
29
and
thou
shalt
grope
at
noonday
as
the
blind
gropeth
in
darkness
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
in
thy
ways
and
thou
shalt
be
only
oppressed
and
spoiled
evermore
and
no
man
shall
save
thee
28
30
thou
shalt
betroth
a
wife
and
another
man
shall
lie
with
her
thou
shalt
build
an
house
and
thou
shalt
not
dwell
therein
thou
shalt
plant
a
vineyard
and
shalt
not
gather
the
grapes
thereof
28
31
thine
ox
shall
be
slain
before
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
not
eat
thereof
thine
ass
shall
be
violently
taken
away
from
before
thy
face
and
shall
not
be
restored
to
thee
thy
sheep
shall
be
given
unto
thine
enemies
and
thou
shalt
have
none
to
rescue
them
28
32
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
given
unto
another
people
and
thine
eyes
shall
look
and
fail
with
longing
for
them
all
the
day
long
and
there
shall
be
no
might
in
thine
hand
28
33
the
fruit
of
thy
land
and
all
thy
labours
shall
a
nation
which
thou
knowest
not
eat
up
and
thou
shalt
be
only
oppressed
and
crushed
alway
28
34
so
that
thou
shalt
be
mad
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see
28
35
the
lord
shall
smite
thee
in
the
knees
and
in
the
legs
with
a
sore
botch
that
cannot
be
healed
from
the
sole
of
thy
foot
unto
the
top
of
thy
head
28
36
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
and
thy
king
which
thou
shalt
set
over
thee
unto
a
nation
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known
and
there
shalt
thou
serve
other
gods
wood
and
stone
28
37
and
thou
shalt
become
an
astonishment
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
nations
whither
the
lord
shall
lead
thee
28
38
thou
shalt
carry
much
seed
out
into
the
field
and
shalt
gather
but
little
in
for
the
locust
shall
consume
it
28
39
thou
shalt
plant
vineyards
and
dress
them
but
shalt
neither
drink
of
the
wine
nor
gather
the
grapes
for
the
worms
shall
eat
them
28
40
thou
shalt
have
olive
trees
throughout
all
thy
coasts
but
thou
shalt
not
anoint
thyself
with
the
oil
for
thine
olive
shall
cast
his
fruit
28
41
thou
shalt
beget
sons
and
daughters
but
thou
shalt
not
enjoy
them
for
they
shall
go
into
captivity
28
42
all
thy
trees
and
fruit
of
thy
land
shall
the
locust
consume
28
43
the
stranger
that
is
within
thee
shall
get
up
above
thee
very
high
and
thou
shalt
come
down
very
low
28
44
he
shall
lend
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
lend
to
him
he
shall
be
the
head
and
thou
shalt
be
the
tail
28
45
moreover
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee
and
shall
pursue
thee
and
overtake
thee
till
thou
be
destroyed
because
thou
hearkenedst
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
he
commanded
thee
28
46
and
they
shall
be
upon
thee
for
a
sign
and
for
a
wonder
and
upon
thy
seed
for
ever
28
47
because
thou
servedst
not
the
lord
thy
god
with
joyfulness
and
with
gladness
of
heart
for
the
abundance
of
all
things
28
48
therefore
shalt
thou
serve
thine
enemies
which
the
lord
shall
send
against
thee
in
hunger
and
in
thirst
and
in
nakedness
and
in
want
of
all
things
and
he
shall
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
thy
neck
until
he
have
destroyed
thee
28
49
the
lord
shall
bring
a
nation
against
thee
from
far
from
the
end
of
the
earth
as
swift
as
the
eagle
flieth
a
nation
whose
tongue
thou
shalt
not
understand
28
50
a
nation
of
fierce
countenance
which
shall
not
regard
the
person
of
the
old
nor
shew
favour
to
the
young
28
51
and
he
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land
until
thou
be
destroyed
which
also
shall
not
leave
thee
either
corn
wine
or
oil
or
the
increase
of
thy
kine
or
flocks
of
thy
sheep
until
he
have
destroyed
thee
28
52
and
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates
until
thy
high
and
fenced
walls
come
down
wherein
thou
trustedst
throughout
all
thy
land
and
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates
throughout
all
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
28
53
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
fruit
of
thine
own
body
the
flesh
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
in
the
siege
and
in
the
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee
28
54
so
that
the
man
that
is
tender
among
you
and
very
delicate
his
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
his
brother
and
toward
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
toward
the
remnant
of
his
children
which
he
shall
leave
28
55
so
that
he
will
not
give
to
any
of
them
of
the
flesh
of
his
children
whom
he
shall
eat
because
he
hath
nothing
left
him
in
the
siege
and
in
the
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee
in
all
thy
gates
28
56
the
tender
and
delicate
woman
among
you
which
would
not
adventure
to
set
the
sole
of
her
foot
upon
the
ground
for
delicateness
and
tenderness
her
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
the
husband
of
her
bosom
and
toward
her
son
and
toward
her
daughter
28
57
and
toward
her
young
one
that
cometh
out
from
between
her
feet
and
toward
her
children
which
she
shall
bear
for
she
shall
eat
them
for
want
of
all
things
secretly
in
the
siege
and
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemy
shall
distress
thee
in
thy
gates
28
58
if
thou
wilt
not
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
that
are
written
in
this
book
that
thou
mayest
fear
this
glorious
and
fearful
name
the
lord
thy
god
28
59
then
the
lord
will
make
thy
plagues
wonderful
and
the
plagues
of
thy
seed
even
great
plagues
and
of
long
continuance
and
sore
sicknesses
and
of
long
continuance
28
60
moreover
he
will
bring
upon
thee
all
the
diseases
of
egypt
which
thou
wast
afraid
of
and
they
shall
cleave
unto
thee
28
61
also
every
sickness
and
every
plague
which
is
not
written
in
the
book
of
this
law
them
will
the
lord
bring
upon
thee
until
thou
be
destroyed
28
62
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
whereas
ye
were
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude
because
thou
wouldest
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
28
63
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
as
the
lord
rejoiced
over
you
to
do
you
good
and
to
multiply
you
so
the
lord
will
rejoice
over
you
to
destroy
you
and
to
bring
you
to
nought
and
ye
shall
be
plucked
from
off
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
28
64
and
the
lord
shall
scatter
thee
among
all
people
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
and
there
thou
shalt
serve
other
gods
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known
even
wood
and
stone
28
65
and
among
these
nations
shalt
thou
find
no
ease
neither
shall
the
sole
of
thy
foot
have
rest
but
the
lord
shall
give
thee
there
a
trembling
heart
and
failing
of
eyes
and
sorrow
of
mind
28
66
and
thy
life
shall
hang
in
doubt
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
fear
day
and
night
and
shalt
have
none
assurance
of
thy
life
28
67
in
the
morning
thou
shalt
say
would
god
it
were
even
and
at
even
thou
shalt
say
would
god
it
were
morning
for
the
fear
of
thine
heart
wherewith
thou
shalt
fear
and
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see
28
68
and
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
into
egypt
again
with
ships
by
the
way
whereof
i
spake
unto
thee
thou
shalt
see
it
no
more
again
and
there
ye
shall
be
sold
unto
your
enemies
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
and
no
man
shall
buy
you
29
1
these
are
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
the
lord
commanded
moses
to
make
with
the
children
of
israel
in
the
land
of
moab
beside
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
them
in
horeb
29
2
and
moses
called
unto
all
israel
and
said
unto
them
ye
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
did
before
your
eyes
in
the
land
of
egypt
unto
pharaoh
and
unto
all
his
servants
and
unto
all
his
land
29
3
the
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
the
signs
and
those
great
miracles
29
4
yet
the
lord
hath
not
given
you
an
heart
to
perceive
and
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
unto
this
day
29
5
and
i
have
led
you
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
your
clothes
are
not
waxen
old
upon
you
and
thy
shoe
is
not
waxen
old
upon
thy
foot
29
6
ye
have
not
eaten
bread
neither
have
ye
drunk
wine
or
strong
drink
that
ye
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
29
7
and
when
ye
came
unto
this
place
sihon
the
king
of
heshbon
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
came
out
against
us
unto
battle
and
we
smote
them
29
8
and
we
took
their
land
and
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
the
reubenites
and
to
the
gadites
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
29
9
keep
therefore
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
do
them
that
ye
may
prosper
in
all
that
ye
do
29
10
ye
stand
this
day
all
of
you
before
the
lord
your
god
your
captains
of
your
tribes
your
elders
and
your
officers
with
all
the
men
of
israel
29
11
your
little
ones
your
wives
and
thy
stranger
that
is
in
thy
camp
from
the
hewer
of
thy
wood
unto
the
drawer
of
thy
water
29
12
that
thou
shouldest
enter
into
covenant
with
the
lord
thy
god
and
into
his
oath
which
the
lord
thy
god
maketh
with
thee
this
day
29
13
that
he
may
establish
thee
to
day
for
a
people
unto
himself
and
that
he
may
be
unto
thee
a
god
as
he
hath
said
unto
thee
and
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
29
14
neither
with
you
only
do
i
make
this
covenant
and
this
oath
29
15
but
with
him
that
standeth
here
with
us
this
day
before
the
lord
our
god
and
also
with
him
that
is
not
here
with
us
this
day
29
16
(for
ye
know
how
we
have
dwelt
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
how
we
came
through
the
nations
which
ye
passed
by
29
17
and
ye
have
seen
their
abominations
and
their
idols
wood
and
stone
silver
and
gold
which
were
among
them
)
29
18
lest
there
should
be
among
you
man
or
woman
or
family
or
tribe
whose
heart
turneth
away
this
day
from
the
lord
our
god
to
go
and
serve
the
gods
of
these
nations
lest
there
should
be
among
you
a
root
that
beareth
gall
and
wormwood
29
19
and
it
come
to
pass
when
he
heareth
the
words
of
this
curse
that
he
bless
himself
in
his
heart
saying
i
shall
have
peace
though
i
walk
in
the
imagination
of
mine
heart
to
add
drunkenness
to
thirst
29
20
the
lord
will
not
spare
him
but
then
the
anger
of
the
lord
and
his
jealousy
shall
smoke
against
that
man
and
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book
shall
lie
upon
him
and
the
lord
shall
blot
out
his
name
from
under
heaven
29
21
and
the
lord
shall
separate
him
unto
evil
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
according
to
all
the
curses
of
the
covenant
that
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law
29
22
so
that
the
generation
to
come
of
your
children
that
shall
rise
up
after
you
and
the
stranger
that
shall
come
from
a
far
land
shall
say
when
they
see
the
plagues
of
that
land
and
the
sicknesses
which
the
lord
hath
laid
upon
it
29
23
and
that
the
whole
land
thereof
is
brimstone
and
salt
and
burning
that
it
is
not
sown
nor
beareth
nor
any
grass
groweth
therein
like
the
overthrow
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
admah
and
zeboim
which
the
lord
overthrew
in
his
anger
and
in
his
wrath
29
24
even
all
nations
shall
say
wherefore
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
what
meaneth
the
heat
of
this
great
anger
29
25
then
men
shall
say
because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
29
26
for
they
went
and
served
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
gods
whom
they
knew
not
and
whom
he
had
not
given
unto
them
29
27
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
this
land
to
bring
upon
it
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book
29
28
and
the
lord
rooted
them
out
of
their
land
in
anger
and
in
wrath
and
in
great
indignation
and
cast
them
into
another
land
as
it
is
this
day
29
29
the
secret
things
belong
unto
the
lord
our
god
but
those
things
which
are
revealed
belong
unto
us
and
to
our
children
for
ever
that
we
may
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
30
1
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee
the
blessing
and
the
curse
which
i
have
set
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
call
them
to
mind
among
all
the
nations
whither
the
lord
thy
god
hath
driven
thee
30
2
and
shalt
return
unto
the
lord
thy
god
and
shalt
obey
his
voice
according
to
all
that
i
command
thee
this
day
thou
and
thy
children
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
30
3
that
then
the
lord
thy
god
will
turn
thy
captivity
and
have
compassion
upon
thee
and
will
return
and
gather
thee
from
all
the
nations
whither
the
lord
thy
god
hath
scattered
thee
30
4
if
any
of
thine
be
driven
out
unto
the
outmost
parts
of
heaven
from
thence
will
the
lord
thy
god
gather
thee
and
from
thence
will
he
fetch
thee
30
5
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
bring
thee
into
the
land
which
thy
fathers
possessed
and
thou
shalt
possess
it
and
he
will
do
thee
good
and
multiply
thee
above
thy
fathers
30
6
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
circumcise
thine
heart
and
the
heart
of
thy
seed
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
that
thou
mayest
live
30
7
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
all
these
curses
upon
thine
enemies
and
on
them
that
hate
thee
which
persecuted
thee
30
8
and
thou
shalt
return
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
do
all
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
30
9
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
make
thee
plenteous
in
every
work
of
thine
hand
in
the
fruit
of
thy
body
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
land
for
good
for
the
lord
will
again
rejoice
over
thee
for
good
as
he
rejoiced
over
thy
fathers
30
10
if
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law
and
if
thou
turn
unto
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
30
11
for
this
commandment
which
i
command
thee
this
day
it
is
not
hidden
from
thee
neither
is
it
far
off
30
12
it
is
not
in
heaven
that
thou
shouldest
say
who
shall
go
up
for
us
to
heaven
and
bring
it
unto
us
that
we
may
hear
it
and
do
it
30
13
neither
is
it
beyond
the
sea
that
thou
shouldest
say
who
shall
go
over
the
sea
for
us
and
bring
it
unto
us
that
we
may
hear
it
and
do
it
30
14
but
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
do
it
30
15
see
i
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
good
and
death
and
evil
30
16
in
that
i
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
that
thou
mayest
live
and
multiply
and
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bless
thee
in
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
30
17
but
if
thine
heart
turn
away
so
that
thou
wilt
not
hear
but
shalt
be
drawn
away
and
worship
other
gods
and
serve
them
30
18
i
denounce
unto
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
and
that
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
the
land
whither
thou
passest
over
jordan
to
go
to
possess
it
30
19
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
this
day
against
you
that
i
have
set
before
you
life
and
death
blessing
and
cursing
therefore
choose
life
that
both
thou
and
thy
seed
may
live
30
20
that
thou
mayest
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
that
thou
mayest
obey
his
voice
and
that
thou
mayest
cleave
unto
him
for
he
is
thy
life
and
the
length
of
thy
days
that
thou
mayest
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
to
give
them
31
1
and
moses
went
and
spake
these
words
unto
all
israel
31
2
and
he
said
unto
them
i
am
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
this
day
i
can
no
more
go
out
and
come
in
also
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
jordan
31
3
the
lord
thy
god
he
will
go
over
before
thee
and
he
will
destroy
these
nations
from
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
possess
them
and
joshua
he
shall
go
over
before
thee
as
the
lord
hath
said
31
4
and
the
lord
shall
do
unto
them
as
he
did
to
sihon
and
to
og
kings
of
the
amorites
and
unto
the
land
of
them
whom
he
destroyed
31
5
and
the
lord
shall
give
them
up
before
your
face
that
ye
may
do
unto
them
according
unto
all
the
commandments
which
i
have
commanded
you
31
6
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
fear
not
nor
be
afraid
of
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
he
it
is
that
doth
go
with
thee
he
will
not
fail
thee
nor
forsake
thee
31
7
and
moses
called
unto
joshua
and
said
unto
him
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
thou
must
go
with
this
people
unto
the
land
which
the
lord
hath
sworn
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them
and
thou
shalt
cause
them
to
inherit
it
31
8
and
the
lord
he
it
is
that
doth
go
before
thee
he
will
be
with
thee
he
will
not
fail
thee
neither
forsake
thee
fear
not
neither
be
dismayed
31
9
and
moses
wrote
this
law
and
delivered
it
unto
the
priests
the
sons
of
levi
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
unto
all
the
elders
of
israel
31
10
and
moses
commanded
them
saying
at
the
end
of
every
seven
years
in
the
solemnity
of
the
year
of
release
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles
31
11
when
all
israel
is
come
to
appear
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose
thou
shalt
read
this
law
before
all
israel
in
their
hearing
31
12
gather
the
people
together
men
and
women
and
children
and
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
that
they
may
hear
and
that
they
may
learn
and
fear
the
lord
your
god
and
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
31
13
and
that
their
children
which
have
not
known
any
thing
may
hear
and
learn
to
fear
the
lord
your
god
as
long
as
ye
live
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
31
14
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
behold
thy
days
approach
that
thou
must
die
call
joshua
and
present
yourselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
that
i
may
give
him
a
charge
and
moses
and
joshua
went
and
presented
themselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
31
15
and
the
lord
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud
and
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
stood
over
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
31
16
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
behold
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
and
this
people
will
rise
up
and
go
a
whoring
after
the
gods
of
the
strangers
of
the
land
whither
they
go
to
be
among
them
and
will
forsake
me
and
break
my
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
them
31
17
then
my
anger
shall
be
kindled
against
them
in
that
day
and
i
will
forsake
them
and
i
will
hide
my
face
from
them
and
they
shall
be
devoured
and
many
evils
and
troubles
shall
befall
them
so
that
they
will
say
in
that
day
are
not
these
evils
come
upon
us
because
our
god
is
not
among
us
31
18
and
i
will
surely
hide
my
face
in
that
day
for
all
the
evils
which
they
shall
have
wrought
in
that
they
are
turned
unto
other
gods
31
19
now
therefore
write
ye
this
song
for
you
and
teach
it
the
children
of
israel
put
it
in
their
mouths
that
this
song
may
be
a
witness
for
me
against
the
children
of
israel
31
20
for
when
i
shall
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
they
shall
have
eaten
and
filled
themselves
and
waxen
fat
then
will
they
turn
unto
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
provoke
me
and
break
my
covenant
31
21
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
many
evils
and
troubles
are
befallen
them
that
this
song
shall
testify
against
them
as
a
witness
for
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
out
of
the
mouths
of
their
seed
for
i
know
their
imagination
which
they
go
about
even
now
before
i
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
i
sware
31
22
moses
therefore
wrote
this
song
the
same
day
and
taught
it
the
children
of
israel
31
23
and
he
gave
joshua
the
son
of
nun
a
charge
and
said
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
thou
shalt
bring
the
children
of
israel
into
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
them
and
i
will
be
with
thee
31
24
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
had
made
an
end
of
writing
the
words
of
this
law
in
a
book
until
they
were
finished
31
25
that
moses
commanded
the
levites
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
saying
31
26
take
this
book
of
the
law
and
put
it
in
the
side
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
that
it
may
be
there
for
a
witness
against
thee
31
27
for
i
know
thy
rebellion
and
thy
stiff
neck
behold
while
i
am
yet
alive
with
you
this
day
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
and
how
much
more
after
my
death
31
28
gather
unto
me
all
the
elders
of
your
tribes
and
your
officers
that
i
may
speak
these
words
in
their
ears
and
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
against
them
31
29
for
i
know
that
after
my
death
ye
will
utterly
corrupt
yourselves
and
turn
aside
from
the
way
which
i
have
commanded
you
and
evil
will
befall
you
in
the
latter
days
because
ye
will
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
through
the
work
of
your
hands
31
30
and
moses
spake
in
the
ears
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
the
words
of
this
song
until
they
were
ended
32
1
give
ear
o
ye
heavens
and
i
will
speak
and
hear
o
earth
the
words
of
my
mouth
32
2
my
doctrine
shall
drop
as
the
rain
my
speech
shall
distil
as
the
dew
as
the
small
rain
upon
the
tender
herb
and
as
the
showers
upon
the
grass
32
3
because
i
will
publish
the
name
of
the
lord
ascribe
ye
greatness
unto
our
god
32
4
he
is
the
rock
his
work
is
perfect
for
all
his
ways
are
judgment
a
god
of
truth
and
without
iniquity
just
and
right
is
he
32
5
they
have
corrupted
themselves
their
spot
is
not
the
spot
of
his
children
they
are
a
perverse
and
crooked
generation
32
6
do
ye
thus
requite
the
lord
o
foolish
people
and
unwise
is
not
he
thy
father
that
hath
bought
thee
hath
he
not
made
thee
and
established
thee
32
7
remember
the
days
of
old
consider
the
years
of
many
generations
ask
thy
father
and
he
will
shew
thee
thy
elders
and
they
will
tell
thee
32
8
when
the
most
high
divided
to
the
nations
their
inheritance
when
he
separated
the
sons
of
adam
he
set
the
bounds
of
the
people
according
to
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
32
9
for
the
lord’s
portion
is
his
people
jacob
is
the
lot
of
his
inheritance
32
10
he
found
him
in
a
desert
land
and
in
the
waste
howling
wilderness
he
led
him
about
he
instructed
him
he
kept
him
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
32
11
as
an
eagle
stirreth
up
her
nest
fluttereth
over
her
young
spreadeth
abroad
her
wings
taketh
them
beareth
them
on
her
wings
32
12
so
the
lord
alone
did
lead
him
and
there
was
no
strange
god
with
him
32
13
he
made
him
ride
on
the
high
places
of
the
earth
that
he
might
eat
the
increase
of
the
fields
and
he
made
him
to
suck
honey
out
of
the
rock
and
oil
out
of
the
flinty
rock
32
14
butter
of
kine
and
milk
of
sheep
with
fat
of
lambs
and
rams
of
the
breed
of
bashan
and
goats
with
the
fat
of
kidneys
of
wheat
and
thou
didst
drink
the
pure
blood
of
the
grape
32
15
but
jeshurun
waxed
fat
and
kicked
thou
art
waxen
fat
thou
art
grown
thick
thou
art
covered
with
fatness
then
he
forsook
god
which
made
him
and
lightly
esteemed
the
rock
of
his
salvation
32
16
they
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
strange
gods
with
abominations
provoked
they
him
to
anger
32
17
they
sacrificed
unto
devils
not
to
god
to
gods
whom
they
knew
not
to
new
gods
that
came
newly
up
whom
your
fathers
feared
not
32
18
of
the
rock
that
begat
thee
thou
art
unmindful
and
hast
forgotten
god
that
formed
thee
32
19
and
when
the
lord
saw
it
he
abhorred
them
because
of
the
provoking
of
his
sons
and
of
his
daughters
32
20
and
he
said
i
will
hide
my
face
from
them
i
will
see
what
their
end
shall
be
for
they
are
a
very
froward
generation
children
in
whom
is
no
faith
32
21
they
have
moved
me
to
jealousy
with
that
which
is
not
god
they
have
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
vanities
and
i
will
move
them
to
jealousy
with
those
which
are
not
a
people
i
will
provoke
them
to
anger
with
a
foolish
nation
32
22
for
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger
and
shall
burn
unto
the
lowest
hell
and
shall
consume
the
earth
with
her
increase
and
set
on
fire
the
foundations
of
the
mountains
32
23
i
will
heap
mischiefs
upon
them
i
will
spend
mine
arrows
upon
them
32
24
they
shall
be
burnt
with
hunger
and
devoured
with
burning
heat
and
with
bitter
destruction
i
will
also
send
the
teeth
of
beasts
upon
them
with
the
poison
of
serpents
of
the
dust
32
25
the
sword
without
and
terror
within
shall
destroy
both
the
young
man
and
the
virgin
the
suckling
also
with
the
man
of
gray
hairs
32
26
i
said
i
would
scatter
them
into
corners
i
would
make
the
remembrance
of
them
to
cease
from
among
men
32
27
were
it
not
that
i
feared
the
wrath
of
the
enemy
lest
their
adversaries
should
behave
themselves
strangely
and
lest
they
should
say
our
hand
is
high
and
the
lord
hath
not
done
all
this
32
28
for
they
are
a
nation
void
of
counsel
neither
is
there
any
understanding
in
them
32
29
o
that
they
were
wise
that
they
understood
this
that
they
would
consider
their
latter
end
32
30
how
should
one
chase
a
thousand
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
except
their
rock
had
sold
them
and
the
lord
had
shut
them
up
32
31
for
their
rock
is
not
as
our
rock
even
our
enemies
themselves
being
judges
32
32
for
their
vine
is
of
the
vine
of
sodom
and
of
the
fields
of
gomorrah
their
grapes
are
grapes
of
gall
their
clusters
are
bitter
32
33
their
wine
is
the
poison
of
dragons
and
the
cruel
venom
of
asps
32
34
is
not
this
laid
up
in
store
with
me
and
sealed
up
among
my
treasures
32
35
to
me
belongeth
vengeance
and
recompence
their
foot
shall
slide
in
due
time
for
the
day
of
their
calamity
is
at
hand
and
the
things
that
shall
come
upon
them
make
haste
32
36
for
the
lord
shall
judge
his
people
and
repent
himself
for
his
servants
when
he
seeth
that
their
power
is
gone
and
there
is
none
shut
up
or
left
32
37
and
he
shall
say
where
are
their
gods
their
rock
in
whom
they
trusted
32
38
which
did
eat
the
fat
of
their
sacrifices
and
drank
the
wine
of
their
drink
offerings
let
them
rise
up
and
help
you
and
be
your
protection
32
39
see
now
that
i
even
i
am
he
and
there
is
no
god
with
me
i
kill
and
i
make
alive
i
wound
and
i
heal
neither
is
there
any
that
can
deliver
out
of
my
hand
32
40
for
i
lift
up
my
hand
to
heaven
and
say
i
live
for
ever
32
41
if
i
whet
my
glittering
sword
and
mine
hand
take
hold
on
judgment
i
will
render
vengeance
to
mine
enemies
and
will
reward
them
that
hate
me
32
42
i
will
make
mine
arrows
drunk
with
blood
and
my
sword
shall
devour
flesh
and
that
with
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
of
the
captives
from
the
beginning
of
revenges
upon
the
enemy
32
43
rejoice
o
ye
nations
with
his
people
for
he
will
avenge
the
blood
of
his
servants
and
will
render
vengeance
to
his
adversaries
and
will
be
merciful
unto
his
land
and
to
his
people
32
44
and
moses
came
and
spake
all
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
ears
of
the
people
he
and
hoshea
the
son
of
nun
32
45
and
moses
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words
to
all
israel
32
46
and
he
said
unto
them
set
your
hearts
unto
all
the
words
which
i
testify
among
you
this
day
which
ye
shall
command
your
children
to
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
32
47
for
it
is
not
a
vain
thing
for
you
because
it
is
your
life
and
through
this
thing
ye
shall
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
32
48
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
that
selfsame
day
saying
32
49
get
thee
up
into
this
mountain
abarim
unto
mount
nebo
which
is
in
the
land
of
moab
that
is
over
against
jericho
and
behold
the
land
of
canaan
which
i
give
unto
the
children
of
israel
for
a
possession
32
50
and
die
in
the
mount
whither
thou
goest
up
and
be
gathered
unto
thy
people
as
aaron
thy
brother
died
in
mount
hor
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people
32
51
because
ye
trespassed
against
me
among
the
children
of
israel
at
the
waters
of
meribahkadesh
in
the
wilderness
of
zin
because
ye
sanctified
me
not
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
israel
32
52
yet
thou
shalt
see
the
land
before
thee
but
thou
shalt
not
go
thither
unto
the
land
which
i
give
the
children
of
israel
33
1
and
this
is
the
blessing
wherewith
moses
the
man
of
god
blessed
the
children
of
israel
before
his
death
33
2
and
he
said
the
lord
came
from
sinai
and
rose
up
from
seir
unto
them
he
shined
forth
from
mount
paran
and
he
came
with
ten
thousands
of
saints
from
his
right
hand
went
a
fiery
law
for
them
33
3
yea
he
loved
the
people
all
his
saints
are
in
thy
hand
and
they
sat
down
at
thy
feet
every
one
shall
receive
of
thy
words
33
4
moses
commanded
us
a
law
even
the
inheritance
of
the
congregation
of
jacob
33
5
and
he
was
king
in
jeshurun
when
the
heads
of
the
people
and
the
tribes
of
israel
were
gathered
together
33
6
let
reuben
live
and
not
die
and
let
not
his
men
be
few
33
7
and
this
is
the
blessing
of
judah
and
he
said
hear
lord
the
voice
of
judah
and
bring
him
unto
his
people
let
his
hands
be
sufficient
for
him
and
be
thou
an
help
to
him
from
his
enemies
33
8
and
of
levi
he
said
let
thy
thummim
and
thy
urim
be
with
thy
holy
one
whom
thou
didst
prove
at
massah
and
with
whom
thou
didst
strive
at
the
waters
of
meribah
33
9
who
said
unto
his
father
and
to
his
mother
i
have
not
seen
him
neither
did
he
acknowledge
his
brethren
nor
knew
his
own
children
for
they
have
observed
thy
word
and
kept
thy
covenant
33
10
they
shall
teach
jacob
thy
judgments
and
israel
thy
law
they
shall
put
incense
before
thee
and
whole
burnt
sacrifice
upon
thine
altar
33
11
bless
lord
his
substance
and
accept
the
work
of
his
hands
smite
through
the
loins
of
them
that
rise
against
him
and
of
them
that
hate
him
that
they
rise
not
again
33
12
and
of
benjamin
he
said
the
beloved
of
the
lord
shall
dwell
in
safety
by
him
and
the
lord
shall
cover
him
all
the
day
long
and
he
shall
dwell
between
his
shoulders
33
13
and
of
joseph
he
said
blessed
of
the
lord
be
his
land
for
the
precious
things
of
heaven
for
the
dew
and
for
the
deep
that
coucheth
beneath
33
14
and
for
the
precious
fruits
brought
forth
by
the
sun
and
for
the
precious
things
put
forth
by
the
moon
33
15
and
for
the
chief
things
of
the
ancient
mountains
and
for
the
precious
things
of
the
lasting
hills
33
16
and
for
the
precious
things
of
the
earth
and
fulness
thereof
and
for
the
good
will
of
him
that
dwelt
in
the
bush
let
the
blessing
come
upon
the
head
of
joseph
and
upon
the
top
of
the
head
of
him
that
was
separated
from
his
brethren
33
17
his
glory
is
like
the
firstling
of
his
bullock
and
his
horns
are
like
the
horns
of
unicorns
with
them
he
shall
push
the
people
together
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
they
are
the
ten
thousands
of
ephraim
and
they
are
the
thousands
of
manasseh
33
18
and
of
zebulun
he
said
rejoice
zebulun
in
thy
going
out
and
issachar
in
thy
tents
33
19
they
shall
call
the
people
unto
the
mountain
there
they
shall
offer
sacrifices
of
righteousness
for
they
shall
suck
of
the
abundance
of
the
seas
and
of
treasures
hid
in
the
sand
33
20
and
of
gad
he
said
blessed
be
he
that
enlargeth
gad
he
dwelleth
as
a
lion
and
teareth
the
arm
with
the
crown
of
the
head
33
21
and
he
provided
the
first
part
for
himself
because
there
in
a
portion
of
the
lawgiver
was
he
seated
and
he
came
with
the
heads
of
the
people
he
executed
the
justice
of
the
lord
and
his
judgments
with
israel
33
22
and
of
dan
he
said
dan
is
a
lion’s
whelp
he
shall
leap
from
bashan
33
23
and
of
naphtali
he
said
o
naphtali
satisfied
with
favour
and
full
with
the
blessing
of
the
lord
possess
thou
the
west
and
the
south
33
24
and
of
asher
he
said
let
asher
be
blessed
with
children
let
him
be
acceptable
to
his
brethren
and
let
him
dip
his
foot
in
oil
33
25
thy
shoes
shall
be
iron
and
brass
and
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
be
33
26
there
is
none
like
unto
the
god
of
jeshurun
who
rideth
upon
the
heaven
in
thy
help
and
in
his
excellency
on
the
sky
33
27
the
eternal
god
is
thy
refuge
and
underneath
are
the
everlasting
arms
and
he
shall
thrust
out
the
enemy
from
before
thee
and
shall
say
destroy
them
33
28
israel
then
shall
dwell
in
safety
alone
the
fountain
of
jacob
shall
be
upon
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
also
his
heavens
shall
drop
down
dew
33
29
happy
art
thou
o
israel
who
is
like
unto
thee
o
people
saved
by
the
lord
the
shield
of
thy
help
and
who
is
the
sword
of
thy
excellency
and
thine
enemies
shall
be
found
liars
unto
thee
and
thou
shalt
tread
upon
their
high
places
34
1
and
moses
went
up
from
the
plains
of
moab
unto
the
mountain
of
nebo
to
the
top
of
pisgah
that
is
over
against
jericho
and
the
lord
shewed
him
all
the
land
of
gilead
unto
dan
34
2
and
all
naphtali
and
the
land
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
and
all
the
land
of
judah
unto
the
utmost
sea
34
3
and
the
south
and
the
plain
of
the
valley
of
jericho
the
city
of
palm
trees
unto
zoar
34
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
this
is
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
saying
i
will
give
it
unto
thy
seed
i
have
caused
thee
to
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
thou
shalt
not
go
over
thither
34
5
so
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
there
in
the
land
of
moab
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
34
6
and
he
buried
him
in
a
valley
in
the
land
of
moab
over
against
bethpeor
but
no
man
knoweth
of
his
sepulchre
unto
this
day
34
7
and
moses
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
died
his
eye
was
not
dim
nor
his
natural
force
abated
34
8
and
the
children
of
israel
wept
for
moses
in
the
plains
of
moab
thirty
days
so
the
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
for
moses
were
ended
34
9
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
wisdom
for
moses
had
laid
his
hands
upon
him
and
the
children
of
israel
hearkened
unto
him
and
did
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
34
10
and
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
israel
like
unto
moses
whom
the
lord
knew
face
to
face
34
11
in
all
the
signs
and
the
wonders
which
the
lord
sent
him
to
do
in
the
land
of
egypt
to
pharaoh
and
to
all
his
servants
and
to
all
his
land
34
12
and
in
all
that
mighty
hand
and
in
all
the
great
terror
which
moses
shewed
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
the
book
of
joshua
1
1
now
after
the
death
of
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
the
son
of
nun
moses’
minister
saying
1
2
moses
my
servant
is
dead
now
therefore
arise
go
over
this
jordan
thou
and
all
this
people
unto
the
land
which
i
do
give
to
them
even
to
the
children
of
israel
1
3
every
place
that
the
sole
of
your
foot
shall
tread
upon
that
have
i
given
unto
you
as
i
said
unto
moses
1
4
from
the
wilderness
and
this
lebanon
even
unto
the
great
river
the
river
euphrates
all
the
land
of
the
hittites
and
unto
the
great
sea
toward
the
going
down
of
the
sun
shall
be
your
coast
1
5
there
shall
not
any
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
all
the
days
of
thy
life
as
i
was
with
moses
so
i
will
be
with
thee
i
will
not
fail
thee
nor
forsake
thee
1
6
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
unto
this
people
shalt
thou
divide
for
an
inheritance
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them
1
7
only
be
thou
strong
and
very
courageous
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
the
law
which
moses
my
servant
commanded
thee
turn
not
from
it
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
that
thou
mayest
prosper
whithersoever
thou
goest
1
8
this
book
of
the
law
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth
but
thou
shalt
meditate
therein
day
and
night
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
is
written
therein
for
then
thou
shalt
make
thy
way
prosperous
and
then
thou
shalt
have
good
success
1
9
have
not
i
commanded
thee
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
be
not
afraid
neither
be
thou
dismayed
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
1
10
then
joshua
commanded
the
officers
of
the
people
saying
1
11
pass
through
the
host
and
command
the
people
saying
prepare
you
victuals
for
within
three
days
ye
shall
pass
over
this
jordan
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
you
to
possess
it
1
12
and
to
the
reubenites
and
to
the
gadites
and
to
half
the
tribe
of
manasseh
spake
joshua
saying
1
13
remember
the
word
which
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
you
saying
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
rest
and
hath
given
you
this
land
1
14
your
wives
your
little
ones
and
your
cattle
shall
remain
in
the
land
which
moses
gave
you
on
this
side
jordan
but
ye
shall
pass
before
your
brethren
armed
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
help
them
1
15
until
the
lord
have
given
your
brethren
rest
as
he
hath
given
you
and
they
also
have
possessed
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
them
then
ye
shall
return
unto
the
land
of
your
possession
and
enjoy
it
which
moses
the
lord’s
servant
gave
you
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
1
16
and
they
answered
joshua
saying
all
that
thou
commandest
us
we
will
do
and
whithersoever
thou
sendest
us
we
will
go
1
17
according
as
we
hearkened
unto
moses
in
all
things
so
will
we
hearken
unto
thee
only
the
lord
thy
god
be
with
thee
as
he
was
with
moses
1
18
whosoever
he
be
that
doth
rebel
against
thy
commandment
and
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
in
all
that
thou
commandest
him
he
shall
be
put
to
death
only
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
2

and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
sent
out
of
shittim
two
men
to
spy
secretly
saying
go
view
the
land
even
jericho
and
they
went
and
came
into
an
harlot’s
house
named
rahab
and
lodged
there
2
2
and
it
was
told
the
king
of
jericho
saying
behold
there
came
men
in
hither
to
night
of
the
children
of
israel
to
search
out
the
country
2
3
and
the
king
of
jericho
sent
unto
rahab
saying
bring
forth
the
men
that
are
come
to
thee
which
are
entered
into
thine
house
for
they
be
come
to
search
out
all
the
country
2

and
the
woman
took
the
two
men
and
hid
them
and
said
thus
there
came
men
unto
me
but
i
wist
not
whence
they
were
2
5
and
it
came
to
pass
about
the
time
of
shutting
of
the
gate
when
it
was
dark
that
the
men
went
out
whither
the
men
went
i
wot
not
pursue
after
them
quickly
for
ye
shall
overtake
them
2
6
but
she
had
brought
them
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
hid
them
with
the
stalks
of
flax
which
she
had
laid
in
order
upon
the
roof
2
7
and
the
men
pursued
after
them
the
way
to
jordan
unto
the
fords
and
as
soon
as
they
which
pursued
after
them
were
gone
out
they
shut
the
gate
2
8
and
before
they
were
laid
down
she
came
up
unto
them
upon
the
roof
2
9
and
she
said
unto
the
men
i
know
that
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
land
and
that
your
terror
is
fallen
upon
us
and
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
faint
because
of
you
2
10
for
we
have
heard
how
the
lord
dried
up
the
water
of
the
red
sea
for
you
when
ye
came
out
of
egypt
and
what
ye
did
unto
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
sihon
and
og
whom
ye
utterly
destroyed
2
11
and
as
soon
as
we
had
heard
these
things
our
hearts
did
melt
neither
did
there
remain
any
more
courage
in
any
man
because
of
you
for
the
lord
your
god
he
is
god
in
heaven
above
and
in
earth
beneath
2
12
now
therefore
i
pray
you
swear
unto
me
by
the
lord
since
i
have
shewed
you
kindness
that
ye
will
also
shew
kindness
unto
my
father’s
house
and
give
me
a
true
token
2
13
and
that
ye
will
save
alive
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
brethren
and
my
sisters
and
all
that
they
have
and
deliver
our
lives
from
death
2
14
and
the
men
answered
her
our
life
for
yours
if
ye
utter
not
this
our
business
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
hath
given
us
the
land
that
we
will
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
thee
2
15
then
she
let
them
down
by
a
cord
through
the
window
for
her
house
was
upon
the
town
wall
and
she
dwelt
upon
the
wall
2
16
and
she
said
unto
them
get
you
to
the
mountain
lest
the
pursuers
meet
you
and
hide
yourselves
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
be
returned
and
afterward
may
ye
go
your
way
2
17
and
the
men
said
unto
her
we
will
be
blameless
of
this
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
us
swear
2
18
behold
when
we
come
into
the
land
thou
shalt
bind
this
line
of
scarlet
thread
in
the
window
which
thou
didst
let
us
down
by
and
thou
shalt
bring
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
and
all
thy
father’s
household
home
unto
thee
2
19
and
it
shall
be
that
whosoever
shall
go
out
of
the
doors
of
thy
house
into
the
street
his
blood
shall
be
upon
his
head
and
we
will
be
guiltless
and
whosoever
shall
be
with
thee
in
the
house
his
blood
shall
be
on
our
head
if
any
hand
be
upon
him
2
20
and
if
thou
utter
this
our
business
then
we
will
be
quit
of
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
us
to
swear
2
21
and
she
said
according
unto
your
words
so
be
it
and
she
sent
them
away
and
they
departed
and
she
bound
the
scarlet
line
in
the
window
2
22
and
they
went
and
came
unto
the
mountain
and
abode
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
were
returned
and
the
pursuers
sought
them
throughout
all
the
way
but
found
them
not
2
23
so
the
two
men
returned
and
descended
from
the
mountain
and
passed
over
and
came
to
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
told
him
all
things
that
befell
them
2
24
and
they
said
unto
joshua
truly
the
lord
hath
delivered
into
our
hands
all
the
land
for
even
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
do
faint
because
of
us
3
1
and
joshua
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
they
removed
from
shittim
and
came
to
jordan
he
and
all
the
children
of
israel
and
lodged
there
before
they
passed
over
3
2
and
it
came
to
pass
after
three
days
that
the
officers
went
through
the
host
3
3
and
they
commanded
the
people
saying
when
ye
see
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
and
the
priests
the
levites
bearing
it
then
ye
shall
remove
from
your
place
and
go
after
it
3
4
yet
there
shall
be
a
space
between
you
and
it
about
two
thousand
cubits
by
measure
come
not
near
unto
it
that
ye
may
know
the
way
by
which
ye
must
go
for
ye
have
not
passed
this
way
heretofore
3
5
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
sanctify
yourselves
for
to
morrow
the
lord
will
do
wonders
among
you
3
6
and
joshua
spake
unto
the
priests
saying
take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
pass
over
before
the
people
and
they
took
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
went
before
the
people
3
7
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
this
day
will
i
begin
to
magnify
thee
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
that
they
may
know
that
as
i
was
with
moses
so
i
will
be
with
thee
3
8
and
thou
shalt
command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
saying
when
ye
are
come
to
the
brink
of
the
water
of
jordan
ye
shall
stand
still
in
jordan
3
9
and
joshua
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
come
hither
and
hear
the
words
of
the
lord
your
god
3
10
and
joshua
said
hereby
ye
shall
know
that
the
living
god
is
among
you
and
that
he
will
without
fail
drive
out
from
before
you
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
hivites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
girgashites
and
the
amorites
and
the
jebusites
3
11
behold
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
passeth
over
before
you
into
jordan
3
12
now
therefore
take
you
twelve
men
out
of
the
tribes
of
israel
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
3
13
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
soon
as
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
lord
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
shall
rest
in
the
waters
of
jordan
that
the
waters
of
jordan
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
waters
that
come
down
from
above
and
they
shall
stand
upon
an
heap
3
14
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
people
removed
from
their
tents
to
pass
over
jordan
and
the
priests
bearing
the
ark
of
the
covenant
before
the
people
3
15
and
as
they
that
bare
the
ark
were
come
unto
jordan
and
the
feet
of
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
were
dipped
in
the
brim
of
the
water
(for
jordan
overfloweth
all
his
banks
all
the
time
of
harvest
)
3
16
that
the
waters
which
came
down
from
above
stood
and
rose
up
upon
an
heap
very
far
from
the
city
adam
that
is
beside
zaretan
and
those
that
came
down
toward
the
sea
of
the
plain
even
the
salt
sea
failed
and
were
cut
off
and
the
people
passed
over
right
against
jericho
3
17
and
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
stood
firm
on
dry
ground
in
the
midst
of
jordan
and
all
the
israelites
passed
over
on
dry
ground
until
all
the
people
were
passed
clean
over
jordan
4
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
people
were
clean
passed
over
jordan
that
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
saying
4
2
take
you
twelve
men
out
of
the
people
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
4
3
and
command
ye
them
saying
take
you
hence
out
of
the
midst
of
jordan
out
of
the
place
where
the
priests’
feet
stood
firm
twelve
stones
and
ye
shall
carry
them
over
with
you
and
leave
them
in
the
lodging
place
where
ye
shall
lodge
this
night
4
4
then
joshua
called
the
twelve
men
whom
he
had
prepared
of
the
children
of
israel
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
4
5
and
joshua
said
unto
them
pass
over
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
your
god
into
the
midst
of
jordan
and
take
you
up
every
man
of
you
a
stone
upon
his
shoulder
according
unto
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
4
6
that
this
may
be
a
sign
among
you
that
when
your
children
ask
their
fathers
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
ye
by
these
stones
4
7
then
ye
shall
answer
them
that
the
waters
of
jordan
were
cut
off
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
when
it
passed
over
jordan
the
waters
of
jordan
were
cut
off
and
these
stones
shall
be
for
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
israel
for
ever
4
8
and
the
children
of
israel
did
so
as
joshua
commanded
and
took
up
twelve
stones
out
of
the
midst
of
jordan
as
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
and
carried
them
over
with
them
unto
the
place
where
they
lodged
and
laid
them
down
there
4
9
and
joshua
set
up
twelve
stones
in
the
midst
of
jordan
in
the
place
where
the
feet
of
the
priests
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
stood
and
they
are
there
unto
this
day
4
10
for
the
priests
which
bare
the
ark
stood
in
the
midst
of
jordan
until
everything
was
finished
that
the
lord
commanded
joshua
to
speak
unto
the
people
according
to
all
that
moses
commanded
joshua
and
the
people
hasted
and
passed
over
4
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
people
were
clean
passed
over
that
the
ark
of
the
lord
passed
over
and
the
priests
in
the
presence
of
the
people
4
12
and
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
half
the
tribe
of
manasseh
passed
over
armed
before
the
children
of
israel
as
moses
spake
unto
them
4
13
about
forty
thousand
prepared
for
war
passed
over
before
the
lord
unto
battle
to
the
plains
of
jericho
4
14
on
that
day
the
lord
magnified
joshua
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
and
they
feared
him
as
they
feared
moses
all
the
days
of
his
life
4
15
and
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
saying
4
16
command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
testimony
that
they
come
up
out
of
jordan
4
17
joshua
therefore
commanded
the
priests
saying
come
ye
up
out
of
jordan
4
18
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
were
come
up
out
of
the
midst
of
jordan
and
the
soles
of
the
priests’
feet
were
lifted
up
unto
the
dry
land
that
the
waters
of
jordan
returned
unto
their
place
and
flowed
over
all
his
banks
as
they
did
before
4
19
and
the
people
came
up
out
of
jordan
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
encamped
in
gilgal
in
the
east
border
of
jericho
4
20
and
those
twelve
stones
which
they
took
out
of
jordan
did
joshua
pitch
in
gilgal
4
21
and
he
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
saying
when
your
children
shall
ask
their
fathers
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
these
stones
4
22
then
ye
shall
let
your
children
know
saying
israel
came
over
this
jordan
on
dry
land
4
23
for
the
lord
your
god
dried
up
the
waters
of
jordan
from
before
you
until
ye
were
passed
over
as
the
lord
your
god
did
to
the
red
sea
which
he
dried
up
from
before
us
until
we
were
gone
over
4
24
that
all
the
people
of
the
earth
might
know
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
it
is
mighty
that
ye
might
fear
the
lord
your
god
for
ever
5
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
kings
of
the
amorites
which
were
on
the
side
of
jordan
westward
and
all
the
kings
of
the
canaanites
which
were
by
the
sea
heard
that
the
lord
had
dried
up
the
waters
of
jordan
from
before
the
children
of
israel
until
we
were
passed
over
that
their
heart
melted
neither
was
there
spirit
in
them
any
more
because
of
the
children
of
israel
5
2
at
that
time
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
make
thee
sharp
knives
and
circumcise
again
the
children
of
israel
the
second
time
5
3
and
joshua
made
him
sharp
knives
and
circumcised
the
children
of
israel
at
the
hill
of
the
foreskins
5
4
and
this
is
the
cause
why
joshua
did
circumcise
all
the
people
that
came
out
of
egypt
that
were
males
even
all
the
men
of
war
died
in
the
wilderness
by
the
way
after
they
came
out
of
egypt
5
5
now
all
the
people
that
came
out
were
circumcised
but
all
the
people
that
were
born
in
the
wilderness
by
the
way
as
they
came
forth
out
of
egypt
them
they
had
not
circumcised
5
6
for
the
children
of
israel
walked
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
till
all
the
people
that
were
men
of
war
which
came
out
of
egypt
were
consumed
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
unto
whom
the
lord
sware
that
he
would
not
shew
them
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
he
would
give
us
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
5
7
and
their
children
whom
he
raised
up
in
their
stead
them
joshua
circumcised
for
they
were
uncircumcised
because
they
had
not
circumcised
them
by
the
way
5
8
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
done
circumcising
all
the
people
that
they
abode
in
their
places
in
the
camp
till
they
were
whole
5
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
this
day
have
i
rolled
away
the
reproach
of
egypt
from
off
you
wherefore
the
name
of
the
place
is
called
gilgal
unto
this
day
5
10
and
the
children
of
israel
encamped
in
gilgal
and
kept
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
at
even
in
the
plains
of
jericho
5
11
and
they
did
eat
of
the
old
corn
of
the
land
on
the
morrow
after
the
passover
unleavened
cakes
and
parched
corn
in
the
selfsame
day
5
12
and
the
manna
ceased
on
the
morrow
after
they
had
eaten
of
the
old
corn
of
the
land
neither
had
the
children
of
israel
manna
any
more
but
they
did
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
of
canaan
that
year
5
13
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
was
by
jericho
that
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
stood
a
man
over
against
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
joshua
went
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
for
us
or
for
our
adversaries
5
14
and
he
said
nay
but
as
captain
of
the
host
of
the
lord
am
i
now
come
and
joshua
fell
on
his
face
to
the
earth
and
did
worship
and
said
unto
him
what
saith
my
lord
unto
his
servant
5
15
and
the
captain
of
the
lord’s
host
said
unto
joshua
loose
thy
shoe
from
off
thy
foot
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
and
joshua
did
so
6
1
now
jericho
was
straitly
shut
up
because
of
the
children
of
israel
none
went
out
and
none
came
in
6
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
see
i
have
given
into
thine
hand
jericho
and
the
king
thereof
and
the
mighty
men
of
valour
6
3
and
ye
shall
compass
the
city
all
ye
men
of
war
and
go
round
about
the
city
once
thus
shalt
thou
do
six
days
6
4
and
seven
priests
shall
bear
before
the
ark
seven
trumpets
of
rams’
horns
and
the
seventh
day
ye
shall
compass
the
city
seven
times
and
the
priests
shall
blow
with
the
trumpets
6
5
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
make
a
long
blast
with
the
ram’s
horn
and
when
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
all
the
people
shall
shout
with
a
great
shout
and
the
wall
of
the
city
shall
fall
down
flat
and
the
people
shall
ascend
up
every
man
straight
before
him
6
6
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
called
the
priests
and
said
unto
them
take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
let
seven
priests
bear
seven
trumpets
of
rams’
horns
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
6
7
and
he
said
unto
the
people
pass
on
and
compass
the
city
and
let
him
that
is
armed
pass
on
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
6
8
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
had
spoken
unto
the
people
that
the
seven
priests
bearing
the
seven
trumpets
of
rams’
horns
passed
on
before
the
lord
and
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
followed
them
6
9
and
the
armed
men
went
before
the
priests
that
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
rereward
came
after
the
ark
the
priests
going
on
and
blowing
with
the
trumpets
6
10
and
joshua
had
commanded
the
people
saying
ye
shall
not
shout
nor
make
any
noise
with
your
voice
neither
shall
any
word
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
until
the
day
i
bid
you
shout
then
shall
ye
shout
6
11
so
the
ark
of
the
lord
compassed
the
city
going
about
it
once
and
they
came
into
the
camp
and
lodged
in
the
camp
6
12
and
joshua
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
the
priests
took
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
6
13
and
seven
priests
bearing
seven
trumpets
of
rams’
horns
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
went
on
continually
and
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
armed
men
went
before
them
but
the
rereward
came
after
the
ark
of
the
lord
the
priests
going
on
and
blowing
with
the
trumpets
6
14
and
the
second
day
they
compassed
the
city
once
and
returned
into
the
camp
so
they
did
six
days
6
15
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
they
rose
early
about
the
dawning
of
the
day
and
compassed
the
city
after
the
same
manner
seven
times
only
on
that
day
they
compassed
the
city
seven
times
6
16
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seventh
time
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
trumpets
joshua
said
unto
the
people
shout
for
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
city
6
17
and
the
city
shall
be
accursed
even
it
and
all
that
are
therein
to
the
lord
only
rahab
the
harlot
shall
live
she
and
all
that
are
with
her
in
the
house
because
she
hid
the
messengers
that
we
sent
6
18
and
ye
in
any
wise
keep
yourselves
from
the
accursed
thing
lest
ye
make
yourselves
accursed
when
ye
take
of
the
accursed
thing
and
make
the
camp
of
israel
a
curse
and
trouble
it
6
19
but
all
the
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
of
brass
and
iron
are
consecrated
unto
the
lord
they
shall
come
into
the
treasury
of
the
lord
6
20
so
the
people
shouted
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
the
people
shouted
with
a
great
shout
that
the
wall
fell
down
flat
so
that
the
people
went
up
into
the
city
every
man
straight
before
him
and
they
took
the
city
6
21
and
they
utterly
destroyed
all
that
was
in
the
city
both
man
and
woman
young
and
old
and
ox
and
sheep
and
ass
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
6
22
but
joshua
had
said
unto
the
two
men
that
had
spied
out
the
country
go
into
the
harlot’s
house
and
bring
out
thence
the
woman
and
all
that
she
hath
as
ye
sware
unto
her
6
23
and
the
young
men
that
were
spies
went
in
and
brought
out
rahab
and
her
father
and
her
mother
and
her
brethren
and
all
that
she
had
and
they
brought
out
all
her
kindred
and
left
them
without
the
camp
of
israel
6
24
and
they
burnt
the
city
with
fire
and
all
that
was
therein
only
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
of
brass
and
of
iron
they
put
into
the
treasury
of
the
house
of
the
lord
6
25
and
joshua
saved
rahab
the
harlot
alive
and
her
father’s
household
and
all
that
she
had
and
she
dwelleth
in
israel
even
unto
this
day
because
she
hid
the
messengers
which
joshua
sent
to
spy
out
jericho
6
26
and
joshua
adjured
them
at
that
time
saying
cursed
be
the
man
before
the
lord
that
riseth
up
and
buildeth
this
city
jericho
he
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
in
his
firstborn
and
in
his
youngest
son
shall
he
set
up
the
gates
of
it
6
27
so
the
lord
was
with
joshua
and
his
fame
was
noised
throughout
all
the
country
7
1
but
the
children
of
israel
committed
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
thing
for
achan
the
son
of
carmi
the
son
of
zabdi
the
son
of
zerah
of
the
tribe
of
judah
took
of
the
accursed
thing
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
the
children
of
israel
7
2
and
joshua
sent
men
from
jericho
to
ai
which
is
beside
bethaven
on
the
east
of
bethel
and
spake
unto
them
saying
go
up
and
view
the
country
and
the
men
went
up
and
viewed
ai
7
3
and
they
returned
to
joshua
and
said
unto
him
let
not
all
the
people
go
up
but
let
about
two
or
three
thousand
men
go
up
and
smite
ai
and
make
not
all
the
people
to
labour
thither
for
they
are
but
few
7
4
so
there
went
up
thither
of
the
people
about
three
thousand
men
and
they
fled
before
the
men
of
ai
7
5
and
the
men
of
ai
smote
of
them
about
thirty
and
six
men
for
they
chased
them
from
before
the
gate
even
unto
shebarim
and
smote
them
in
the
going
down
wherefore
the
hearts
of
the
people
melted
and
became
as
water
7
6
and
joshua
rent
his
clothes
and
fell
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
until
the
eventide
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
put
dust
upon
their
heads
7
7
and
joshua
said
alas
o
lord
god
wherefore
hast
thou
at
all
brought
this
people
over
jordan
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
amorites
to
destroy
us
would
to
god
we
had
been
content
and
dwelt
on
the
other
side
jordan
7
8
o
lord
what
shall
i
say
when
israel
turneth
their
backs
before
their
enemies
7
9
for
the
canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
hear
of
it
and
shall
environ
us
round
and
cut
off
our
name
from
the
earth
and
what
wilt
thou
do
unto
thy
great
name
7
10
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
get
thee
up
wherefore
liest
thou
thus
upon
thy
face
7
11
israel
hath
sinned
and
they
have
also
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
them
for
they
have
even
taken
of
the
accursed
thing
and
have
also
stolen
and
dissembled
also
and
they
have
put
it
even
among
their
own
stuff
7
12
therefore
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stand
before
their
enemies
but
turned
their
backs
before
their
enemies
because
they
were
accursed
neither
will
i
be
with
you
any
more
except
ye
destroy
the
accursed
from
among
you
7
13
up
sanctify
the
people
and
say
sanctify
yourselves
against
to
morrow
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
an
accursed
thing
in
the
midst
of
thee
o
israel
thou
canst
not
stand
before
thine
enemies
until
ye
take
away
the
accursed
thing
from
among
you
7
14
in
the
morning
therefore
ye
shall
be
brought
according
to
your
tribes
and
it
shall
be
that
the
tribe
which
the
lord
taketh
shall
come
according
to
the
families
thereof
and
the
family
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
by
households
and
the
household
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
man
by
man
7
15
and
it
shall
be
that
he
that
is
taken
with
the
accursed
thing
shall
be
burnt
with
fire
he
and
all
that
he
hath
because
he
hath
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
because
he
hath
wrought
folly
in
israel
7
16
so
joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
brought
israel
by
their
tribes
and
the
tribe
of
judah
was
taken
7
17
and
he
brought
the
family
of
judah
and
he
took
the
family
of
the
zarhites
and
he
brought
the
family
of
the
zarhites
man
by
man
and
zabdi
was
taken
7
18
and
he
brought
his
household
man
by
man
and
achan
the
son
of
carmi
the
son
of
zabdi
the
son
of
zerah
of
the
tribe
of
judah
was
taken
7
19
and
joshua
said
unto
achan
my
son
give
i
pray
thee
glory
to
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
make
confession
unto
him
and
tell
me
now
what
thou
hast
done
hide
it
not
from
me
7
20
and
achan
answered
joshua
and
said
indeed
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
i
done
7
21
when
i
saw
among
the
spoils
a
goodly
babylonish
garment
and
two
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
a
wedge
of
gold
of
fifty
shekels
weight
then
i
coveted
them
and
took
them
and
behold
they
are
hid
in
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
my
tent
and
the
silver
under
it
7
22
so
joshua
sent
messengers
and
they
ran
unto
the
tent
and
behold
it
was
hid
in
his
tent
and
the
silver
under
it
7
23
and
they
took
them
out
of
the
midst
of
the
tent
and
brought
them
unto
joshua
and
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
laid
them
out
before
the
lord
7
24
and
joshua
and
all
israel
with
him
took
achan
the
son
of
zerah
and
the
silver
and
the
garment
and
the
wedge
of
gold
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
his
oxen
and
his
asses
and
his
sheep
and
his
tent
and
all
that
he
had
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
valley
of
achor
7
25
and
joshua
said
why
hast
thou
troubled
us
the
lord
shall
trouble
thee
this
day
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
and
burned
them
with
fire
after
they
had
stoned
them
with
stones
7
26
and
they
raised
over
him
a
great
heap
of
stones
unto
this
day
so
the
lord
turned
from
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
wherefore
the
name
of
that
place
was
called
the
valley
of
achor
unto
this
day
8
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
fear
not
neither
be
thou
dismayed
take
all
the
people
of
war
with
thee
and
arise
go
up
to
ai
see
i
have
given
into
thy
hand
the
king
of
ai
and
his
people
and
his
city
and
his
land
8
2
and
thou
shalt
do
to
ai
and
her
king
as
thou
didst
unto
jericho
and
her
king
only
the
spoil
thereof
and
the
cattle
thereof
shall
ye
take
for
a
prey
unto
yourselves
lay
thee
an
ambush
for
the
city
behind
it
8
3
so
joshua
arose
and
all
the
people
of
war
to
go
up
against
ai
and
joshua
chose
out
thirty
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
and
sent
them
away
by
night
8
4
and
he
commanded
them
saying
behold
ye
shall
lie
in
wait
against
the
city
even
behind
the
city
go
not
very
far
from
the
city
but
be
ye
all
ready
8
5
and
i
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
me
will
approach
unto
the
city
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
they
come
out
against
us
as
at
the
first
that
we
will
flee
before
them
8
6
(for
they
will
come
out
after
us)
till
we
have
drawn
them
from
the
city
for
they
will
say
they
flee
before
us
as
at
the
first
therefore
we
will
flee
before
them
8
7
then
ye
shall
rise
up
from
the
ambush
and
seize
upon
the
city
for
the
lord
your
god
will
deliver
it
into
your
hand
8
8
and
it
shall
be
when
ye
have
taken
the
city
that
ye
shall
set
the
city
on
fire
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
shall
ye
do
see
i
have
commanded
you
8
9
joshua
therefore
sent
them
forth
and
they
went
to
lie
in
ambush
and
abode
between
bethel
and
ai
on
the
west
side
of
ai
but
joshua
lodged
that
night
among
the
people
8
10
and
joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
numbered
the
people
and
went
up
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
before
the
people
to
ai
8
11
and
all
the
people
even
the
people
of
war
that
were
with
him
went
up
and
drew
nigh
and
came
before
the
city
and
pitched
on
the
north
side
of
ai
now
there
was
a
valley
between
them
and
ai
8
12
and
he
took
about
five
thousand
men
and
set
them
to
lie
in
ambush
between
bethel
and
ai
on
the
west
side
of
the
city
8
13
and
when
they
had
set
the
people
even
all
the
host
that
was
on
the
north
of
the
city
and
their
liers
in
wait
on
the
west
of
the
city
joshua
went
that
night
into
the
midst
of
the
valley
8
14
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
of
ai
saw
it
that
they
hasted
and
rose
up
early
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
against
israel
to
battle
he
and
all
his
people
at
a
time
appointed
before
the
plain
but
he
wist
not
that
there
were
liers
in
ambush
against
him
behind
the
city
8
15
and
joshua
and
all
israel
made
as
if
they
were
beaten
before
them
and
fled
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
8
16
and
all
the
people
that
were
in
ai
were
called
together
to
pursue
after
them
and
they
pursued
after
joshua
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
8
17
and
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
ai
or
bethel
that
went
not
out
after
israel
and
they
left
the
city
open
and
pursued
after
israel
8
18
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
stretch
out
the
spear
that
is
in
thy
hand
toward
ai
for
i
will
give
it
into
thine
hand
and
joshua
stretched
out
the
spear
that
he
had
in
his
hand
toward
the
city
8
19
and
the
ambush
arose
quickly
out
of
their
place
and
they
ran
as
soon
as
he
had
stretched
out
his
hand
and
they
entered
into
the
city
and
took
it
and
hasted
and
set
the
city
on
fire
8
20
and
when
the
men
of
ai
looked
behind
them
they
saw
and
behold
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven
and
they
had
no
power
to
flee
this
way
or
that
way
and
the
people
that
fled
to
the
wilderness
turned
back
upon
the
pursuers
8
21
and
when
joshua
and
all
israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
taken
the
city
and
that
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
then
they
turned
again
and
slew
the
men
of
ai
8
22
and
the
other
issued
out
of
the
city
against
them
so
they
were
in
the
midst
of
israel
some
on
this
side
and
some
on
that
side
and
they
smote
them
so
that
they
let
none
of
them
remain
or
escape
8
23
and
the
king
of
ai
they
took
alive
and
brought
him
to
joshua
8
24
and
it
came
to
pass
when
israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
all
the
inhabitants
of
ai
in
the
field
in
the
wilderness
wherein
they
chased
them
and
when
they
were
all
fallen
on
the
edge
of
the
sword
until
they
were
consumed
that
all
the
israelites
returned
unto
ai
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
8
25
and
so
it
was
that
all
that
fell
that
day
both
of
men
and
women
were
twelve
thousand
even
all
the
men
of
ai
8
26
for
joshua
drew
not
his
hand
back
wherewith
he
stretched
out
the
spear
until
he
had
utterly
destroyed
all
the
inhabitants
of
ai
8
27
only
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
that
city
israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
commanded
joshua
8
28
and
joshua
burnt
ai
and
made
it
an
heap
for
ever
even
a
desolation
unto
this
day
8
29
and
the
king
of
ai
he
hanged
on
a
tree
until
eventide
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down
joshua
commanded
that
they
should
take
his
carcase
down
from
the
tree
and
cast
it
at
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
raise
thereon
a
great
heap
of
stones
that
remaineth
unto
this
day
8
30
then
joshua
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
in
mount
ebal
8
31
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
the
children
of
israel
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
an
altar
of
whole
stones
over
which
no
man
hath
lift
up
any
iron
and
they
offered
thereon
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings
8
32
and
he
wrote
there
upon
the
stones
a
copy
of
the
law
of
moses
which
he
wrote
in
the
presence
of
the
children
of
israel
8
33
and
all
israel
and
their
elders
and
officers
and
their
judges
stood
on
this
side
the
ark
and
on
that
side
before
the
priests
the
levites
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
as
well
the
stranger
as
he
that
was
born
among
them
half
of
them
over
against
mount
gerizim
and
half
of
them
over
against
mount
ebal
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
had
commanded
before
that
they
should
bless
the
people
of
israel
8
34
and
afterward
he
read
all
the
words
of
the
law
the
blessings
and
cursings
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
8
35
there
was
not
a
word
of
all
that
moses
commanded
which
joshua
read
not
before
all
the
congregation
of
israel
with
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
strangers
that
were
conversant
among
them
9
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
kings
which
were
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
hills
and
in
the
valleys
and
in
all
the
coasts
of
the
great
sea
over
against
lebanon
the
hittite
and
the
amorite
the
canaanite
the
perizzite
the
hivite
and
the
jebusite
heard
thereof
9
2
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
to
fight
with
joshua
and
with
israel
with
one
accord
9
3
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
heard
what
joshua
had
done
unto
jericho
and
to
ai
9
4
they
did
work
wilily
and
went
and
made
as
if
they
had
been
ambassadors
and
took
old
sacks
upon
their
asses
and
wine
bottles
old
and
rent
and
bound
up
9
5
and
old
shoes
and
clouted
upon
their
feet
and
old
garments
upon
them
and
all
the
bread
of
their
provision
was
dry
and
mouldy
9
6
and
they
went
to
joshua
unto
the
camp
at
gilgal
and
said
unto
him
and
to
the
men
of
israel
we
be
come
from
a
far
country
now
therefore
make
ye
a
league
with
us
9
7
and
the
men
of
israel
said
unto
the
hivites
peradventure
ye
dwell
among
us
and
how
shall
we
make
a
league
with
you
9
8
and
they
said
unto
joshua
we
are
thy
servants
and
joshua
said
unto
them
who
are
ye
and
from
whence
come
ye
9
9
and
they
said
unto
him
from
a
very
far
country
thy
servants
are
come
because
of
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
for
we
have
heard
the
fame
of
him
and
all
that
he
did
in
egypt
9
10
and
all
that
he
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
that
were
beyond
jordan
to
sihon
king
of
heshbon
and
to
og
king
of
bashan
which
was
at
ashtaroth
9
11
wherefore
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
country
spake
to
us
saying
take
victuals
with
you
for
the
journey
and
go
to
meet
them
and
say
unto
them
we
are
your
servants
therefore
now
make
ye
a
league
with
us
9
12
this
our
bread
we
took
hot
for
our
provision
out
of
our
houses
on
the
day
we
came
forth
to
go
unto
you
but
now
behold
it
is
dry
and
it
is
mouldy
9
13
and
these
bottles
of
wine
which
we
filled
were
new
and
behold
they
be
rent
and
these
our
garments
and
our
shoes
are
become
old
by
reason
of
the
very
long
journey
9
14
and
the
men
took
of
their
victuals
and
asked
not
counsel
at
the
mouth
of
the
lord
9
15
and
joshua
made
peace
with
them
and
made
a
league
with
them
to
let
them
live
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
sware
unto
them
9
16
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
days
after
they
had
made
a
league
with
them
that
they
heard
that
they
were
their
neighbours
and
that
they
dwelt
among
them
9
17
and
the
children
of
israel
journeyed
and
came
unto
their
cities
on
the
third
day
now
their
cities
were
gibeon
and
chephirah
and
beeroth
and
kirjathjearim
9
18
and
the
children
of
israel
smote
them
not
because
the
princes
of
the
congregation
had
sworn
unto
them
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
all
the
congregation
murmured
against
the
princes
9
19
but
all
the
princes
said
unto
all
the
congregation
we
have
sworn
unto
them
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
now
therefore
we
may
not
touch
them
9
20
this
we
will
do
to
them
we
will
even
let
them
live
lest
wrath
be
upon
us
because
of
the
oath
which
we
sware
unto
them
9
21
and
the
princes
said
unto
them
let
them
live
but
let
them
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
unto
all
the
congregation
as
the
princes
had
promised
them
9
22
and
joshua
called
for
them
and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
wherefore
have
ye
beguiled
us
saying
we
are
very
far
from
you
when
ye
dwell
among
us
9
23
now
therefore
ye
are
cursed
and
there
shall
none
of
you
be
freed
from
being
bondmen
and
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
house
of
my
god
9
24
and
they
answered
joshua
and
said
because
it
was
certainly
told
thy
servants
how
that
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
his
servant
moses
to
give
you
all
the
land
and
to
destroy
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you
therefore
we
were
sore
afraid
of
our
lives
because
of
you
and
have
done
this
thing
9
25
and
now
behold
we
are
in
thine
hand
as
it
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
to
do
unto
us
do
9
26
and
so
did
he
unto
them
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
children
of
israel
that
they
slew
them
not
9
27
and
joshua
made
them
that
day
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
congregation
and
for
the
altar
of
the
lord
even
unto
this
day
in
the
place
which
he
should
choose
10
1
now
it
came
to
pass
when
adonizedec
king
of
jerusalem
had
heard
how
joshua
had
taken
ai
and
had
utterly
destroyed
it
as
he
had
done
to
jericho
and
her
king
so
he
had
done
to
ai
and
her
king
and
how
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
had
made
peace
with
israel
and
were
among
them
10
2
that
they
feared
greatly
because
gibeon
was
a
great
city
as
one
of
the
royal
cities
and
because
it
was
greater
than
ai
and
all
the
men
thereof
were
mighty
10
3
wherefore
adonizedec
king
of
jerusalem
sent
unto
hoham
king
of
hebron
and
unto
piram
king
of
jarmuth
and
unto
japhia
king
of
lachish
and
unto
debir
king
of
eglon
saying
10
4
come
up
unto
me
and
help
me
that
we
may
smite
gibeon
for
it
hath
made
peace
with
joshua
and
with
the
children
of
israel
10
5
therefore
the
five
kings
of
the
amorites
the
king
of
jerusalem
the
king
of
hebron
the
king
of
jarmuth
the
king
of
lachish
the
king
of
eglon
gathered
themselves
together
and
went
up
they
and
all
their
hosts
and
encamped
before
gibeon
and
made
war
against
it
10
6
and
the
men
of
gibeon
sent
unto
joshua
to
the
camp
to
gilgal
saying
slack
not
thy
hand
from
thy
servants
come
up
to
us
quickly
and
save
us
and
help
us
for
all
the
kings
of
the
amorites
that
dwell
in
the
mountains
are
gathered
together
against
us
10
7
so
joshua
ascended
from
gilgal
he
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
10
8
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
fear
them
not
for
i
have
delivered
them
into
thine
hand
there
shall
not
a
man
of
them
stand
before
thee
10
9
joshua
therefore
came
unto
them
suddenly
and
went
up
from
gilgal
all
night
10
10
and
the
lord
discomfited
them
before
israel
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
at
gibeon
and
chased
them
along
the
way
that
goeth
up
to
bethhoron
and
smote
them
to
azekah
and
unto
makkedah
10
11
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
fled
from
before
israel
and
were
in
the
going
down
to
bethhoron
that
the
lord
cast
down
great
stones
from
heaven
upon
them
unto
azekah
and
they
died
they
were
more
which
died
with
hailstones
than
they
whom
the
children
of
israel
slew
with
the
sword
10
12
then
spake
joshua
to
the
lord
in
the
day
when
the
lord
delivered
up
the
amorites
before
the
children
of
israel
and
he
said
in
the
sight
of
israel
sun
stand
thou
still
upon
gibeon
and
thou
moon
in
the
valley
of
ajalon
10
13
and
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
moon
stayed
until
the
people
had
avenged
themselves
upon
their
enemies
is
not
this
written
in
the
book
of
jasher
so
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
heaven
and
hasted
not
to
go
down
about
a
whole
day
10
14
and
there
was
no
day
like
that
before
it
or
after
it
that
the
lord
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
a
man
for
the
lord
fought
for
israel
10
15
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
the
camp
to
gilgal
10
16
but
these
five
kings
fled
and
hid
themselves
in
a
cave
at
makkedah
10
17
and
it
was
told
joshua
saying
the
five
kings
are
found
hid
in
a
cave
at
makkedah
10
18
and
joshua
said
roll
great
stones
upon
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
set
men
by
it
for
to
keep
them
10
19
and
stay
ye
not
but
pursue
after
your
enemies
and
smite
the
hindmost
of
them
suffer
them
not
to
enter
into
their
cities
for
the
lord
your
god
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand
10
20
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
and
the
children
of
israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
them
with
a
very
great
slaughter
till
they
were
consumed
that
the
rest
which
remained
of
them
entered
into
fenced
cities
10
21
and
all
the
people
returned
to
the
camp
to
joshua
at
makkedah
in
peace
none
moved
his
tongue
against
any
of
the
children
of
israel
10
22
then
said
joshua
open
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
bring
out
those
five
kings
unto
me
out
of
the
cave
10
23
and
they
did
so
and
brought
forth
those
five
kings
unto
him
out
of
the
cave
the
king
of
jerusalem
the
king
of
hebron
the
king
of
jarmuth
the
king
of
lachish
and
the
king
of
eglon
10
24
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
brought
out
those
kings
unto
joshua
that
joshua
called
for
all
the
men
of
israel
and
said
unto
the
captains
of
the
men
of
war
which
went
with
him
come
near
put
your
feet
upon
the
necks
of
these
kings
and
they
came
near
and
put
their
feet
upon
the
necks
of
them
10
25
and
joshua
said
unto
them
fear
not
nor
be
dismayed
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
for
thus
shall
the
lord
do
to
all
your
enemies
against
whom
ye
fight
10
26
and
afterward
joshua
smote
them
and
slew
them
and
hanged
them
on
five
trees
and
they
were
hanging
upon
the
trees
until
the
evening
10
27
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
going
down
of
the
sun
that
joshua
commanded
and
they
took
them
down
off
the
trees
and
cast
them
into
the
cave
wherein
they
had
been
hid
and
laid
great
stones
in
the
cave’s
mouth
which
remain
until
this
very
day
10
28
and
that
day
joshua
took
makkedah
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
king
thereof
he
utterly
destroyed
them
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
let
none
remain
and
he
did
to
the
king
of
makkedah
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
jericho
10
29
then
joshua
passed
from
makkedah
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
libnah
and
fought
against
libnah
10
30
and
the
lord
delivered
it
also
and
the
king
thereof
into
the
hand
of
israel
and
he
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
let
none
remain
in
it
but
did
unto
the
king
thereof
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
jericho
10
31
and
joshua
passed
from
libnah
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
lachish
and
encamped
against
it
and
fought
against
it
10
32
and
the
lord
delivered
lachish
into
the
hand
of
israel
which
took
it
on
the
second
day
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
libnah
10
33
then
horam
king
of
gezer
came
up
to
help
lachish
and
joshua
smote
him
and
his
people
until
he
had
left
him
none
remaining
10
34
and
from
lachish
joshua
passed
unto
eglon
and
all
israel
with
him
and
they
encamped
against
it
and
fought
against
it
10
35
and
they
took
it
on
that
day
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
utterly
destroyed
that
day
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
lachish
10
36
and
joshua
went
up
from
eglon
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
hebron
and
they
fought
against
it
10
37
and
they
took
it
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
king
thereof
and
all
the
cities
thereof
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
left
none
remaining
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
eglon
but
destroyed
it
utterly
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
10
38
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
to
debir
and
fought
against
it
10
39
and
he
took
it
and
the
king
thereof
and
all
the
cities
thereof
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
left
none
remaining
as
he
had
done
to
hebron
so
he
did
to
debir
and
to
the
king
thereof
as
he
had
done
also
to
libnah
and
to
her
king
10
40
so
joshua
smote
all
the
country
of
the
hills
and
of
the
south
and
of
the
vale
and
of
the
springs
and
all
their
kings
he
left
none
remaining
but
utterly
destroyed
all
that
breathed
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
commanded
10
41
and
joshua
smote
them
from
kadeshbarnea
even
unto
gaza
and
all
the
country
of
goshen
even
unto
gibeon
10
42
and
all
these
kings
and
their
land
did
joshua
take
at
one
time
because
the
lord
god
of
israel
fought
for
israel
10
43
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
the
camp
to
gilgal
11
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jabin
king
of
hazor
had
heard
those
things
that
he
sent
to
jobab
king
of
madon
and
to
the
king
of
shimron
and
to
the
king
of
achshaph
11
2
and
to
the
kings
that
were
on
the
north
of
the
mountains
and
of
the
plains
south
of
chinneroth
and
in
the
valley
and
in
the
borders
of
dor
on
the
west
11
3
and
to
the
canaanite
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
and
to
the
amorite
and
the
hittite
and
the
perizzite
and
the
jebusite
in
the
mountains
and
to
the
hivite
under
hermon
in
the
land
of
mizpeh
11
4
and
they
went
out
they
and
all
their
hosts
with
them
much
people
even
as
the
sand
that
is
upon
the
sea
shore
in
multitude
with
horses
and
chariots
very
many
11
5
and
when
all
these
kings
were
met
together
they
came
and
pitched
together
at
the
waters
of
merom
to
fight
against
israel
11
6
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
be
not
afraid
because
of
them
for
to
morrow
about
this
time
will
i
deliver
them
up
all
slain
before
israel
thou
shalt
hough
their
horses
and
burn
their
chariots
with
fire
11
7
so
joshua
came
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him
against
them
by
the
waters
of
merom
suddenly
and
they
fell
upon
them
11
8
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
who
smote
them
and
chased
them
unto
great
zidon
and
unto
misrephothmaim
and
unto
the
valley
of
mizpeh
eastward
and
they
smote
them
until
they
left
them
none
remaining
11
9
and
joshua
did
unto
them
as
the
lord
bade
him
he
houghed
their
horses
and
burnt
their
chariots
with
fire
11
10
and
joshua
at
that
time
turned
back
and
took
hazor
and
smote
the
king
thereof
with
the
sword
for
hazor
beforetime
was
the
head
of
all
those
kingdoms
11
11
and
they
smote
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
utterly
destroying
them
there
was
not
any
left
to
breathe
and
he
burnt
hazor
with
fire
11
12
and
all
the
cities
of
those
kings
and
all
the
kings
of
them
did
joshua
take
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
he
utterly
destroyed
them
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
11
13
but
as
for
the
cities
that
stood
still
in
their
strength
israel
burned
none
of
them
save
hazor
only
that
did
joshua
burn
11
14
and
all
the
spoil
of
these
cities
and
the
cattle
the
children
of
israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves
but
every
man
they
smote
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
until
they
had
destroyed
them
neither
left
they
any
to
breathe
11
15
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
his
servant
so
did
moses
command
joshua
and
so
did
joshua
he
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
11
16
so
joshua
took
all
that
land
the
hills
and
all
the
south
country
and
all
the
land
of
goshen
and
the
valley
and
the
plain
and
the
mountain
of
israel
and
the
valley
of
the
same
11
17
even
from
the
mount
halak
that
goeth
up
to
seir
even
unto
baalgad
in
the
valley
of
lebanon
under
mount
hermon
and
all
their
kings
he
took
and
smote
them
and
slew
them
11
18
joshua
made
war
a
long
time
with
all
those
kings
11
19
there
was
not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel
save
the
hivites
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
all
other
they
took
in
battle
11
20
for
it
was
of
the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
come
against
israel
in
battle
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favour
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
11
21
and
at
that
time
came
joshua
and
cut
off
the
anakims
from
the
mountains
from
hebron
from
debir
from
anab
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
judah
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
israel
joshua
destroyed
them
utterly
with
their
cities
11
22
there
was
none
of
the
anakims
left
in
the
land
of
the
children
of
israel
only
in
gaza
in
gath
and
in
ashdod
there
remained
11
23
so
joshua
took
the
whole
land
according
to
all
that
the
lord
said
unto
moses
and
joshua
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
israel
according
to
their
divisions
by
their
tribes
and
the
land
rested
from
war
12
1
now
these
are
the
kings
of
the
land
which
the
children
of
israel
smote
and
possessed
their

even
unto
the
edge
of
the
sea
of
chinnereth
on
the
other
side
jordan
eastward
13
28
this
is
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
gad
after
their
families
the
cities
and
their
villages
13
29
and
moses
gave
inheritance
unto
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
and
this
was
the
possession
of
the
half
tribe
of
the
children
of
manasseh
by
their
families
13
30
and
their
coast
was
from
mahanaim
all
bashan
all
the
kingdom
of
og
king
of
bashan
and
all
the
towns
of
jair
which
are
in
bashan
threescore
cities
13
31
and
half
gilead
and
ashtaroth
and
edrei
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
og
in
bashan
were
pertaining
unto
the
children
of
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
even
to
the
one
half
of
the
children
of
machir
by
their
families
13
32
these
are
the
countries
which
moses
did
distribute
for
inheritance
in
the
plains
of
moab
on
the
other
side
jordan
by
jericho
eastward
13
33
but
unto
the
tribe
of
levi
moses
gave
not
any
inheritance
the
lord
god
of
israel
was
their
inheritance
as
he
said
unto
them
14
1
and
these
are
the
countries
which
the
children
of
israel
inherited
in
the
land
of
canaan
which
eleazar
the
priest
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
distributed
for
inheritance
to
them
14
2
by
lot
was
their
inheritance
as
the
lord
commanded
by
the
hand
of
moses
for
the
nine
tribes
and
for
the
half
tribe
14
3
for
moses
had
given
the
inheritance
of
two
tribes
and
an
half
tribe
on
the
other
side
jordan
but
unto
the
levites
he
gave
none
inheritance
among
them
14
4
for
the
children
of
joseph
were
two
tribes
manasseh
and
ephraim
therefore
they
gave
no
part
unto
the
levites
in
the
land
save
cities
to
dwell
in
with
their
suburbs
for
their
cattle
and
for
their
substance
14
5
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
the
children
of
israel
did
and
they
divided
the
land
14
6
then
the
children
of
judah
came
unto
joshua
in
gilgal
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
said
unto
him
thou
knowest
the
thing
that
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
of
god
concerning
me
and
thee
in
kadeshbarnea
14
7
forty
years
old
was
i
when
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
sent
me
from
kadeshbarnea
to
espy
out
the
land
and
i
brought
him
word
again
as
it
was
in
mine
heart
14
8
nevertheless
my
brethren
that
went
up
with
me
made
the
heart
of
the
people
melt
but
i
wholly
followed
the
lord
my
god
14
9
and
moses
sware
on
that
day
saying
surely
the
land
whereon
thy
feet
have
trodden
shall
be
thine
inheritance
and
thy
children’s
for
ever
because
thou
hast
wholly
followed
the
lord
my
god
14
10
and
now
behold
the
lord
hath
kept
me
alive
as
he
said
these
forty
and
five
years
even
since
the
lord
spake
this
word
unto
moses
while
the
children
of
israel
wandered
in
the
wilderness
and
now
lo
i
am
this
day
fourscore
and
five
years
old
14
11
as
yet
i
am
as
strong
this
day
as
i
was
in
the
day
that
moses
sent
me
as
my
strength
was
then
even
so
is
my
strength
now
for
war
both
to
go
out
and
to
come
in
14
12
now
therefore
give
me
this
mountain
whereof
the
lord
spake
in
that
day
for
thou
heardest
in
that
day
how
the
anakims
were
there
and
that
the
cities
were
great
and
fenced
if
so
be
the
lord
will
be
with
me
then
i
shall
be
able
to
drive
them
out
as
the
lord
said
14
13
and
joshua
blessed
him
and
gave
unto
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
hebron
for
an
inheritance
14
14
hebron
therefore
became
the
inheritance
of
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
unto
this
day
because
that
he
wholly
followed
the
lord
god
of
israel
14
15
and
the
name
of
hebron
before
was
kirjatharba
which
arba
was
a
great
man
among
the
anakims
and
the
land
had
rest
from
war
15

fell
from

on

to

the

and
to

and
the

16

so
the
children
of
joseph
manasseh
and
ephraim
took
their
inheritance
16
5
and
the
border
of
the
children
of
ephraim
according
to
their
families
was
thus
even
the
border
of
their
inheritance
on
the

side
was

unto

the

16

and
the

unto

and
it
went

to

to

and
came
to

and
went
out
at
jordan
16
8
the
border
went
out
from
tappuah
westward
unto
the
river
kanah
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at
the
sea
this
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
ephraim
by
their
families
16
9
and
the
separate
cities
for
the
children
of
ephraim
were
among
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
manasseh
all
the
cities
with
their
villages
16
10
and
they
drave
not
out
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
gezer
but
the
canaanites
dwell
among
the
ephraimites
unto
this
day
and
serve
under
tribute
17
1
there
was
also
a
lot
for
the
tribe
of
manasseh
for
he
was
the
firstborn
of
joseph
to
wit
for
machir
the
firstborn
of
manasseh
the
father
of
gilead
because
he
was
a
man
of
war
therefore
he
had
gilead
and
bashan
17
2
there
was
also
a
lot
for
the
rest
of
the
children
of
manasseh
by
their
families
for
the
children
of
abiezer
and
for
the
children
of
helek
and
for
the
children
of
asriel
and
for
the
children
of
shechem
and
for
the
children
of
hepher
and
for
the
children
of
shemida
these
were
the
male
children
of
manasseh
the
son
of
joseph
by
their
families
17
3
but
zelophehad
the
son
of
hepher
the
son
of
gilead
the
son
of
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
had
no
sons
but
daughters
and
these
are
the
names
of
his
daughters
mahlah
and
noah
hoglah
milcah
and
tirzah
17
4
and
they
came
near
before
eleazar
the
priest
and
before
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
before
the
princes
saying
the
lord
commanded
moses
to
give
us
an
inheritance
among
our
brethren
therefore
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
he
gave
them
an
inheritance
among
the
brethren
of
their
father
17
5
and
there
fell
ten
portions
to
manasseh
beside
the
land
of
gilead
and
bashan
which
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
17
6
because
the
daughters
of
manasseh
had
an
inheritance
among
his
sons
and
the
rest
of
manasseh’s
sons
had
the
land
of
gilead
17
7
and
the
coast
of
manasseh
was
from
asher
to
michmethah
that
lieth
before
shechem
and
the
border
went
along
on
the
right
hand
unto
the
inhabitants
of
entappuah
17
8
now
manasseh
had
the
land
of
tappuah
but
tappuah
on
the
border
of
manasseh
belonged
to

yet
the

not
drive
out
the

but
the

would
dwell
in

17
13
yet
it
came
to

spake
unto

saying
why
hast
thou
given
me
but
one
lot
and
one
portion
to
inherit
seeing
i
am
a
great
people
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
blessed
me
hitherto
17
15
and
joshua
answered
them
if
thou
be
a
great
people
then
get
thee
up
to
the
wood
country
and
cut
down
for
thyself
there
in
the
land
of
the
perizzites
and
of
the
giants
if
mount
ephraim
be
too
narrow
for
thee
17
16
and
the
children
of
joseph
said
the
hill
is
not
enough
for
us
and
all
the
canaanites
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
valley
have
chariots
of
iron
both
they
who
are
of
bethshean
and
her
towns
and
they
who
are
of
the
valley
of
jezreel
17
17
and
joshua
spake
unto
the
house
of
joseph
even
to
ephraim
and
to
manasseh
saying
thou
art
a
great
people
and
hast
great
power
thou
shalt
not
have
one
lot
only
17
18
but
the
mountain
shall
be
thine
for
it
is
a
wood
and
thou
shalt
cut
it
down
and
the
outgoings
of
it
shall
be
thine
for
thou
shalt
drive
out
the
canaanites
though
they
have
iron
chariots
and
though
they
be
strong

ye

and
bring
the
description
hither
to
me
that
i
may
cast

for
you
here
before

our

there

which
the
lord
had
spoken
unto
the
house
of

all
came
to

22

then
joshua
called
the

and
the
half
tribe
of

22
2
and
said
unto

ye
have
kept

that
moses
the
servant
of

commanded
you
and
have
obeyed
my
voice
in

that
i
commanded
you
22
3
ye
have
not
left

many
days
unto
this
day
but
have
kept
the
charge
of
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
god
22
4
and
now
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
rest
unto
your
brethren
as
he
promised
them
therefore
now
return
ye
and
get
you
unto
your
tents
and
unto
the
land
of
your
possession
which
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
gave
you
on

22
5
but
take
diligent
heed
to
do
the
commandment
and
the
law
which
moses
the

lord
charged
you
to
love

and
to
cleave
unto

and
to
serve
him
with

your
heart
and
with

your
soul
22

so
joshua
blessed
them
and
sent
them
away
and
they
went
unto
their
tents
22
7
now
to
the

half

and
when
joshua
sent
them
away
also
unto

then
he
blessed
them
22
8
and
he
spake
unto

saying
return

riches
unto

and
with
very
much
cattle
with
silver
and
with

and
with

and
with
iron
and
with
very
much
raiment
divide
the
spoil

22

and
the
children

and

and
the
half

returned
and
departed
from

to
go
unto
the

possession
whereof
they
were
possessed
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
moses
22
10
and
when
they
came
unto
the
borders
of
jordan
that
are
in
the
land
of
canaan
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
built
there
an
altar
by
jordan
a
great
altar
to
see
to
22
11
and
the
children
of
israel
heard
say
behold
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
have
built
an
altar
over
against
the
land
of
canaan
in
the
borders
of
jordan
at
the
passage
of
the
children
of
israel
22
12
and
when
the
children
of
israel
heard
of
it
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
at
shiloh
to
go
up
to
war
against
them
22
13
and
the
children
of
israel
sent
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
into
the
land
of
gilead
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
22
14
and
with
him
ten
princes
of
each
chief
house
a
prince
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
and
each
one
was
an
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
among
the
thousands
of
israel
22
15
and
they
came
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
unto
the
land
of
gilead
and
they
spake
with
them
saying
22
16
thus
saith
the
whole
congregation
of
the
lord
what
trespass
is
this
that
ye
have
committed
against
the
god
of
israel
to
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
lord
in
that
ye
have
builded
you
an
altar
that
ye
might
rebel
this
day
against
the
lord
22
17
is
the
iniquity
of
peor
too
little
for
us
from
which
we
are
not
cleansed
until
this
day
although
there
was
a
plague
in
the
congregation
of
the
lord
22
18
but
that
ye
must
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
lord
and
it
will
be
seeing
ye
rebel
to
day
against
the
lord
that
to
morrow
he
will
be
wroth
with
the
whole
congregation
of
israel
22
19
notwithstanding
if
the
land
of
your
possession
be
unclean
then
pass
ye
over
unto
the
land
of
the
possession
of
the
lord
wherein
the
lord’s
tabernacle
dwelleth
and
take
possession
among
us
but
rebel
not
against
the
lord
nor
rebel
against
us
in
building
you
an
altar
beside
the
altar
of
the
lord
our
god
22
20
did
not
achan
the
son
of
zerah
commit
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
thing
and
wrath
fell
on
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
that
man
perished
not
alone
in
his
iniquity
22
21
then
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
answered
and
said
unto
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
israel
22
22
the
lord
god
of
gods
the
lord
god
of
gods
he
knoweth
and
israel
he
shall
know
if
it
be
in
rebellion
or
if
in
transgression
against
the
lord
(save
us
not
this
day
)
22
23
that
we
have
built
us
an
altar
to
turn
from
following
the
lord
or
if
to
offer
thereon
burnt
offering
or
meat
offering
or
if
to
offer
peace
offerings
thereon
let
the
lord
himself
require
it
22
24
and
if
we
have
not
rather
done
it
for
fear
of
this
thing
saying
in
time
to
come
your
children
might
speak
unto
our
children
saying
what
have
ye
to
do
with
the
lord
god
of
israel
22
25
for
the
lord
hath
made
jordan
a
border
between
us
and
you
ye
children
of
reuben
and
children
of
gad
ye
have
no
part
in
the
lord
so
shall
your
children
make
our
children
cease
from
fearing
the
lord
22
26
therefore
we
said
let
us
now
prepare
to
build
us
an
altar
not
for
burnt
offering
nor
for
sacrifice
22
27
but
that
it
may
be
a
witness
between
us
and
you
and
our
generations
after
us
that
we
might
do
the
service
of
the
lord
before
him
with
our
burnt
offerings
and
with
our
sacrifices
and
with
our
peace
offerings
that
your
children
may
not
say
to
our
children
in
time
to
come
ye
have
no
part
in
the
lord
22
28
therefore
said
we
that
it
shall
be
when
they
should
so
say
to
us
or
to
our
generations
in
time
to
come
that
we
may
say
again
behold
the
pattern
of
the
altar
of
the
lord
which
our
fathers
made
not
for
burnt
offerings
nor
for
sacrifices
but
it
is
a
witness
between
us
and
you
22
29
god
forbid
that
we
should
rebel
against
the
lord
and
turn
this
day
from
following
the
lord
to
build
an
altar
for
burnt
offerings
for
meat
offerings
or
for
sacrifices
beside
the
altar
of
the
lord
our
god
that
is
before
his
tabernacle
22
30
and
when
phinehas
the
priest
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
and
heads
of
the
thousands
of
israel
which
were
with
him
heard
the
words
that
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
manasseh
spake
it
pleased
them
22
31
and
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
said
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
children
of
manasseh
this
day
we
perceive
that
the
lord
is
among
us
because
ye
have
not
committed
this
trespass
against
the
lord
now
ye
have
delivered
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
lord
22
32
and
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
and
the
princes
returned
from
the
children
of
reuben
and
from
the
children
of
gad
out
of
the
land
of
gilead
unto
the
land
of
canaan
to
the
children
of
israel
and
brought
them
word
again
22
33
and
the
thing
pleased
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
blessed
god
and
did
not
intend
to
go
up
against
them
in
battle
to
destroy
the
land
wherein
the
children
of
reuben
and
gad
dwelt
22
34
and
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
called
the
altar
ed
for
it
shall
be
a
witness
between
us
that
the
lord
is
god
23
1
and
it
came
to
pass
a
long
time
after
that
the
lord
had
given
rest
unto
israel
from
all
their
enemies
round
about
that
joshua
waxed
old
and
stricken
in
age
23
2
and
joshua
called
for
all
israel
and
for
their
elders
and
for
their
heads
and
for
their
judges
and
for
their
officers
and
said
unto
them
i
am
old
and
stricken
in
age
23
3
and
ye
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
your
god
hath
done
unto
all
these
nations
because
of
you
for
the
lord
your
god
is
he
that
hath
fought
for
you
23
4
behold
i
have
divided
unto
you
by
lot
these
nations
that
remain
to
be
an
inheritance
for
your
tribes
from
jordan
with
all
the
nations
that
i
have
cut
off
even
unto
the
great
sea
westward
23
5
and
the
lord
your
god
he
shall
expel
them
from
before
you
and
drive
them
from
out
of
your
sight
and
ye
shall
possess
their
land
as
the
lord
your
god
hath
promised
unto
you
23
6
be
ye
therefore
very
courageous
to
keep
and
to
do
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
that
ye
turn
not
aside
therefrom
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
23
7
that
ye
come
not
among
these
nations
these
that
remain
among
you
neither
make
mention
of
the
name
of
their
gods
nor
cause
to
swear
by
them
neither
serve
them
nor
bow
yourselves
unto
them
23
8
but
cleave
unto
the
lord
your
god
as
ye
have
done
unto
this
day
23
9
for
the
lord
hath
driven
out
from
before
you
great
nations
and
strong
but
as
for
you
no
man
hath
been
able
to
stand
before
you
unto
this
day
23
10
one
man
of
you
shall
chase
a
thousand
for
the
lord
your
god
he
it
is
that
fighteth
for
you
as
he
hath
promised
you
23
11
take
good
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
that
ye
love
the
lord
your
god
23
12
else
if
ye
do
in
any
wise
go
back
and
cleave
unto
the
remnant
of
these
nations
even
these
that
remain
among
you
and
shall
make
marriages
with
them
and
go
in
unto
them
and
they
to
you
23
13
know
for
a
certainty
that
the
lord
your
god
will
no
more
drive
out
any
of
these
nations
from
before
you
but
they
shall
be
snares
and
traps
unto
you
and
scourges
in
your
sides
and
thorns
in
your
eyes
until
ye
perish
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
23
14
and
behold
this
day
i
am
going
the
way
of
all
the
earth
and
ye
know
in
all
your
hearts
and
in
all
your
souls
that
not
one
thing
hath
failed
of
all
the
good
things
which
the
lord
your
god
spake
concerning
you
all
are
come
to
pass
unto
you
and
not
one
thing
hath
failed
thereof
23
15
therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
as
all
good
things
are
come
upon
you
which
the
lord
your
god
promised
you
so
shall
the
lord
bring
upon
you
all
evil
things
until
he
have
destroyed
you
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
23
16
when
ye
have
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
which
he
commanded
you
and
have
gone
and
served
other
gods
and
bowed
yourselves
to
them
then
shall
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
kindled
against
you
and
ye
shall
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
unto
you
24
1
and
joshua
gathered
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
shechem
and
called
for
the
elders
of
israel
and
for
their
heads
and
for
their
judges
and
for
their
officers
and
they
presented
themselves
before
god
24
2
and
joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
your
fathers
dwelt
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
in
old
time
even
terah
the
father
of
abraham
and
the
father
of
nachor
and
they
served
other
gods
24
3
and
i
took
your
father
abraham
from
the
other
side
of
the
flood
and
led
him
throughout
all
the
land
of
canaan
and
multiplied
his
seed
and
gave
him
isaac
24
4
and
i
gave
unto
isaac
jacob
and
esau
and
i
gave
unto
esau
mount
seir
to
possess
it
but
jacob
and
his
children
went
down
into
egypt
24
5
i
sent
moses
also
and
aaron
and
i
plagued
egypt
according
to
that
which
i
did
among
them
and
afterward
i
brought
you
out
24
6
and
i
brought
your
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
ye
came
unto
the
sea
and
the
egyptians
pursued
after
your
fathers
with
chariots
and
horsemen
unto
the
red
sea
24
7
and
when
they
cried
unto
the
lord
he
put
darkness
between
you
and
the
egyptians
and
brought
the
sea
upon
them
and
covered
them
and
your
eyes
have
seen
what
i
have
done
in
egypt
and
ye
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
a
long
season
24
8
and
i
brought
you
into
the
land
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
on
the
other
side
jordan
and
they
fought
with
you
and
i
gave
them
into
your
hand
that
ye
might
possess
their
land
and
i
destroyed
them
from
before
you
24
9
then
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
arose
and
warred
against
israel
and
sent
and
called
balaam
the
son
of
beor
to
curse
you
24
10
but
i
would
not
hearken
unto
balaam
therefore
he
blessed
you
still
so
i
delivered
you
out
of
his
hand
24
11
and
you
went
over
jordan
and
came
unto
jericho
and
the
men
of
jericho
fought
against
you
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
girgashites
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
and
i
delivered
them
into
your
hand
24
12
and
i
sent
the
hornet
before
you
which
drave
them
out
from
before
you
even
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
but
not
with
thy
sword
nor
with
thy
bow
24
13
and
i
have
given
you
a
land
for
which
ye
did
not
labour
and
cities
which
ye
built
not
and
ye
dwell
in
them
of
the
vineyards
and
oliveyards
which
ye
planted
not
do
ye
eat
24
14
now
therefore
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
in
sincerity
and
in
truth
and
put
away
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
and
in
egypt
and
serve
ye
the
lord
24
15
and
if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the
lord
choose
you
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve
whether
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
or
the
gods
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
24
16
and
the
people
answered
and
said
god
forbid
that
we
should
forsake
the
lord
to
serve
other
gods
24
17
for
the
lord
our
god
he
it
is
that
brought
us
up
and
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
and
which
did
those
great
signs
in
our
sight
and
preserved
us
in
all
the
way
wherein
we
went
and
among
all
the
people
through
whom
we
passed
24
18
and
the
lord
drave
out
from
before
us
all
the
people
even
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
the
land
therefore
will
we
also
serve
the
lord
for
he
is
our
god
24
19
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
ye
cannot
serve
the
lord
for
he
is
an
holy
god
he
is
a
jealous
god
he
will
not
forgive
your
transgressions
nor
your
sins
24
20
if
ye
forsake
the
lord
and
serve
strange
gods
then
he
will
turn
and
do
you
hurt
and
consume
you
after
that
he
hath
done
you
good
24
21
and
the
people
said
unto
joshua
nay
but
we
will
serve
the
lord
24
22
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
ye
are
witnesses
against
yourselves
that
ye
have
chosen
you
the
lord
to
serve
him
and
they
said
we
are
witnesses
24
23
now
therefore
put
away
said
he
the
strange
gods
which
are
among
you
and
incline
your
heart
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
24
24
and
the
people
said
unto
joshua
the
lord
our
god
will
we
serve
and
his
voice
will
we
obey
24
25
so
joshua
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
that
day
and
set
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
in
shechem
24
26
and
joshua
wrote
these
words
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
god
and
took
a
great
stone
and
set
it
up
there
under
an
oak
that
was
by
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
24
27
and
joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
behold
this
stone
shall
be
a
witness
unto
us
for
it
hath
heard
all
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
us
it
shall
be
therefore
a
witness
unto
you
lest
ye
deny
your
god
24
28
so
joshua
let
the
people
depart
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
24
29
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old
24
30
and
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
timnathserah
which
is
in
mount
ephraim
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
of
gaash
24
31
and
israel
served
the
lord
all
the
days
of
joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
overlived
joshua
and
which
had
known
all
the
works
of
the
lord
that
he
had
done
for
israel
24
32
and
the
bones
of
joseph
which
the
children
of
israel
brought
up
out
of
egypt
buried
they
in
shechem
in
a
parcel
of
ground
which
jacob
bought
of
the
sons
of
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
for
an
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
it
became
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
joseph
24
33
and
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
died
and
they
buried
him
in
a
hill
that
pertained
to
phinehas
his
son
which
was
given
him
in
mount
ephraim
the
book
of
judges
1
1
now
after
the
death
of
joshua
it
came
to
pass
that
the
children
of
israel
asked
the
lord
saying
who
shall
go
up
for
us
against
the
canaanites
first
to
fight
against
them
1
2
and
the
lord
said
judah
shall
go
up
behold
i
have
delivered
the
land
into
his
hand
1
3
and
judah
said
unto
simeon
his
brother
come
up
with
me
into
my
lot
that
we
may
fight
against
the
canaanites
and
i
likewise
will
go
with
thee
into
thy
lot
so
simeon
went
with
him
1
4
and
judah
went
up
and
the
lord
delivered
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
into
their
hand
and
they
slew
of
them
in
bezek
ten
thousand
men
1
5
and
they
found
adonibezek
in
bezek
and
they
fought
against
him
and
they
slew
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
1
6
but
adonibezek
fled
and
they
pursued
after
him
and
caught
him
and
cut
off
his
thumbs
and
his
great
toes
1
7
and
adonibezek
said
threescore
and
ten
kings
having
their
thumbs
and
their
great
toes
cut
off
gathered
their
meat
under
my
table
as
i
have
done
so
god
hath
requited
me
and
they
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
there
he
died
1
8
now
the
children
of
judah
had
fought
against
jerusalem
and
had
taken
it
and
smitten
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
set
the
city
on
fire
1
9
and
afterward
the
children
of
judah
went
down
to
fight
against
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
the
mountain
and
in
the
south
and
in
the
valley
1
10
and
judah
went
against
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
hebron
(now
the
name
of
hebron
before
was
kirjatharba
)
and
they
slew
sheshai
and
ahiman
and
talmai
1
11
and
from
thence
he
went
against
the
inhabitants
of
debir
and
the
name
of
debir
before
was
kirjathsepher
1
12
and
caleb
said
he
that
smiteth
kirjathsepher
and
taketh
it
to
him
will
i
give
achsah
my
daughter
to
wife
1
13
and
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
caleb’s
younger
brother
took
it
and
he
gave
him
achsah
his
daughter
to
wife
1
14
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
came
to
him
that
she
moved
him
to
ask
of
her
father
a
field
and
she
lighted
from
off
her
ass
and
caleb
said
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
1
15
and
she
said
unto
him
give
me
a
blessing
for
thou
hast
given
me
a
south
land
give
me
also
springs
of
water
and
caleb
gave
her
the
upper
springs
and
the
nether
springs
1
16
and
the
children
of
the
kenite
moses’
father
in
law
went
up
out
of
the
city
of
palm
trees
with
the
children
of
judah
into
the
wilderness
of
judah
which
lieth
in
the
south
of
arad
and
they
went
and
dwelt
among
the
people
1
17
and
judah
went
with
simeon
his
brother
and
they
slew
the
canaanites
that
inhabited
zephath
and
utterly
destroyed
it
and
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
hormah
1
18
also
judah
took
gaza
with
the
coast
thereof
and
askelon
with
the
coast
thereof
and
ekron
with
the
coast
thereof
1
19
and
the
lord
was
with
judah
and
he
drave
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountain
but
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
because
they
had
chariots
of
iron
1
20
and
they
gave
hebron
unto
caleb
as
moses
said
and
he
expelled
thence
the
three
sons
of
anak
1
21
and
the
children
of
benjamin
did
not
drive
out
the
jebusites
that
inhabited
jerusalem
but
the
jebusites
dwell
with
the
children
of
benjamin
in
jerusalem
unto
this
day
1
22
and
the
house
of
joseph
they
also
went
up
against
bethel
and
the
lord
was
with
them
1
23
and
the
house
of
joseph
sent
to
descry
bethel
(now
the
name
of
the
city
before
was
luz
)
1
24
and
the
spies
saw
a
man
come
forth
out
of
the
city
and
they
said
unto
him
shew
us
we
pray
thee
the
entrance
into
the
city
and
we
will
shew
thee
mercy
1
25
and
when
he
shewed
them
the
entrance
into
the
city
they
smote
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
they
let
go
the
man
and
all
his
family
1
26
and
the
man
went
into
the
land
of
the
hittites
and
built
a
city
and
called
the
name
thereof
luz
which
is
the
name
thereof
unto
this
day

neither

and
her
towns
nor
the
inhabitants
of

and

towns
nor
the
inhabitants
of
megiddo
and
her
towns
but
the
canaanites
would
dwell
in
that
land
1
28
and
it
came
to
pass
when
israel
was
strong
that
they
put
the
canaanites
to
tribute
and
did
not
utterly
drive
them
out
1
29
neither
did
ephraim
drive
out
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
gezer
but
the
canaanites
dwelt
in
gezer
among
them
1

neither
did
zebulun
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
kitron
nor
the
inhabitants
of
nahalol
but
the
canaanites
dwelt
among

and
became
tributaries
1

nor

1
32
but
the
asherites
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
for
they
did
not
drive
them
out
1
33
neither
did
naphtali
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of

nor
the
inhabitants
of
bethanath
but
he
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
nevertheless
the
inhabitants
of
bethshemesh
and
of
bethanath
became
tributaries
unto
them
1
34
and
the
amorites
forced
the
children
of
dan
into
the
mountain
for
they
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
down
to
the
valley
1
35
but
the
amorites
would
dwell
in
mount
heres
in
aijalon
and
in
shaalbim
yet
the
hand
of
the
house
of
joseph
prevailed
so
that
they
became
tributaries
1
36
and
the
coast
of
the
amorites
was
from
the
going
up
to
akrabbim
from
the
rock
and
upward
2
1
and
an
angel
of
the
lord
came
up
from
gilgal
to
bochim
and
said
i
made
you
to
go
up
out
of
egypt
and
have
brought
you
unto
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
your
fathers
and
i
said
i
will
never
break
my
covenant
with
you
2
2
and
ye
shall
make
no
league
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
ye
shall
throw
down
their
altars
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
why
have
ye
done
this
2
3
wherefore
i
also
said
i
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
you
but
they
shall
be
as
thorns
in
your
sides
and
their
gods
shall
be
a
snare
unto
you
2
4
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
that
the
people
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
2
5
and
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
bochim
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto
the
lord
2
6
and
when
joshua
had
let
the
people
go
the
children
of
israel
went
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
to
possess
the
land
2
7
and
the
people
served
the
lord
all
the
days
of
joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
outlived
joshua
who
had
seen
all
the
great
works
of
the
lord
that
he
did
for
israel
2
8
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old
2
9
and
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
timnathheres
in
the
mount
of
ephraim
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
gaash
2
10
and
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
fathers
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
them
which
knew
not
the
lord
nor
yet
the
works
which
he
had
done
for
israel
2
11
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
served
baalim
2
12
and
they
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
of
the
gods
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
and
provoked
the
lord
to
anger
2
13
and
they
forsook
the
lord
and
served
baal
and
ashtaroth
2
14
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
them
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
round
about
so
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
enemies
2
15
whithersoever
they
went
out
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
for
evil
as
the
lord
had
said
and
as
the
lord
had
sworn
unto
them
and
they
were
greatly
distressed
2
16
nevertheless
the
lord
raised
up
judges
which
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
spoiled
them
2
17
and
yet
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
judges
but
they
went
a
whoring
after
other
gods
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
they
turned
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
their
fathers
walked
in
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
lord
but
they
did
not
so
2
18
and
when
the
lord
raised
them
up
judges
then
the
lord
was
with
the
judge
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
judge
for
it
repented
the
lord
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them
2
19
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
judge
was
dead
that
they
returned
and
corrupted
themselves
more
than
their
fathers
in
following
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
bow
down
unto
them
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
doings
nor
from
their
stubborn
way
2
20
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
said
because
that
this
people
hath
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
their
fathers
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
voice
2
21
i
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
of
the
nations
which
joshua
left
when
he
died
2
22
that
through
them
i
may
prove
israel
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
walk
therein
as
their
fathers
did
keep
it
or
not
2
23
therefore
the
lord
left
those
nations
without
driving
them
out
hastily
neither
delivered
he
them
into
the
hand
of
joshua
3
1
now
these
are
the
nations
which
the
lord
left
to
prove
israel
by
them
even
as
many
of
israel
as
had
not
known
all
the
wars
of
canaan
3
2
only
that
the
generations
of
the
children
of
israel
might
know
to
teach
them
war
at
the
least
such
as
before
knew
nothing
thereof
3
3
namely
five
lords
of
the
philistines
and
all
the
canaanites
and
the
sidonians
and
the
hivites
that
dwelt
in
mount
lebanon
from
mount
baalhermon
unto
the
entering
in
of
hamath
3
4
and
they
were
to
prove
israel
by
them
to
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
which
he
commanded
their
fathers
by
the
hand
of
moses
3
5
and
the
children
of
israel
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
hittites
and
amorites
and
perizzites
and
hivites
and
jebusites
3
6
and
they
took
their
daughters
to
be
their
wives
and
gave
their
daughters
to
their
sons
and
served
their
gods
3
7
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
forgat
the
lord
their
god
and
served
baalim
and
the
groves
3
8
therefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
chushanrishathaim
king
of
mesopotamia
and
the
children
of
israel
served
chushanrishathaim
eight
years
3
9
and
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
the
lord
raised
up
a
deliverer
to
the
children
of
israel
who
delivered
them
even
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
caleb’s
younger
brother
3
10
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
he
judged
israel
and
went
out
to
war
and
the
lord
delivered
chushanrishathaim
king
of
mesopotamia
into
his
hand
and
his
hand
prevailed
against
chushanrishathaim
3
11
and
the
land
had
rest
forty
years
and
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
died
3
12
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
strengthened
eglon
the
king
of
moab
against
israel
because
they
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
3
13
and
he
gathered
unto
him
the
children
of
ammon
and
amalek
and
went
and
smote
israel
and
possessed
the
city
of
palm
trees
3
14
so
the
children
of
israel
served
eglon
the
king
of
moab
eighteen
years
3
15
but
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
the
lord
raised
them
up
a
deliverer
ehud
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
a
man
lefthanded
and
by
him
the
children
of
israel
sent
a
present
unto
eglon
the
king
of
moab
3
16
but
ehud
made
him
a
dagger
which
had
two
edges
of
a
cubit
length
and
he
did
gird
it
under
his
raiment
upon
his
right
thigh
3
17
and
he
brought
the
present
unto
eglon
king
of
moab
and
eglon
was
a
very
fat
man
3
18
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
to
offer
the
present
he
sent
away
the
people
that
bare
the
present
3
19
but
he
himself
turned
again
from
the
quarries
that
were
by
gilgal
and
said
i
have
a
secret
errand
unto
thee
o
king
who
said
keep
silence
and
all
that
stood
by
him
went
out
from
him
3
20
and
ehud
came
unto
him
and
he
was
sitting
in
a
summer
parlour
which
he
had
for
himself
alone
and
ehud
said
i
have
a
message
from
god
unto
thee
and
he
arose
out
of
his
seat
3
21
and
ehud
put
forth
his
left
hand
and
took
the
dagger
from
his
right
thigh
and
thrust
it
into
his
belly
3
22
and
the
haft
also
went
in
after
the
blade
and
the
fat
closed
upon
the
blade
so
that
he
could
not
draw
the
dagger
out
of
his
belly
and
the
dirt
came
out
3
23
then
ehud
went
forth
through
the
porch
and
shut
the
doors
of
the
parlour
upon
him
and
locked
them
3
24
when
he
was
gone
out
his
servants
came
and
when
they
saw
that
behold
the
doors
of
the
parlour
were
locked
they
said
surely
he
covereth
his
feet
in
his
summer
chamber
3
25
and
they
tarried
till
they
were
ashamed
and
behold
he
opened
not
the
doors
of
the
parlour
therefore
they
took
a
key
and
opened
them
and
behold
their
lord
was
fallen
down
dead
on
the
earth
3
26
and
ehud
escaped
while
they
tarried
and
passed
beyond
the
quarries
and
escaped
unto
seirath
3
27
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
that
he
blew
a
trumpet
in
the
mountain
of
ephraim
and
the
children
of
israel
went
down
with
him
from
the
mount
and
he
before
them
3
28
and
he
said
unto
them
follow
after
me
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
your
enemies
the
moabites
into
your
hand
and
they
went
down
after
him
and
took
the
fords
of
jordan
toward
moab
and
suffered
not
a
man
to
pass
over
3
29
and
they
slew
of
moab
at
that
time
about
ten
thousand
men
all
lusty
and
all
men
of
valour
and
there
escaped
not
a
man
3
30
so
moab
was
subdued
that
day
under
the
hand
of
israel
and
the
land
had
rest
fourscore
years
3
31
and
after
him
was
shamgar
the
son
of
anath
which
slew
of
the
philistines
six
hundred
men
with
an
ox
goad
and
he
also
delivered
israel
4
1
and
the
children
of
israel
again
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
when
ehud
was
dead
4
2
and
the
lord
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
jabin
king
of
canaan
that
reigned
in
hazor
the
captain
of
whose
host
was
sisera
which
dwelt
in
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
4
3
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
for
he
had
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron
and
twenty
years
he
mightily
oppressed
the
children
of
israel
4
4
and
deborah
a
prophetess
the
wife
of
lapidoth
she
judged
israel
at
that
time
4
5
and
she
dwelt
under
the
palm
tree
of
deborah
between
ramah
and
bethel
in
mount
ephraim
and
the
children
of
israel
came
up
to
her
for
judgment
4
6
and
she
sent
and
called
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
out
of
kedeshnaphtali
and
said
unto
him
hath
not
the
lord
god
of
israel
commanded
saying
go
and
draw
toward
mount
tabor
and
take
with
thee
ten
thousand
men
of
the
children
of
naphtali
and
of
the
children
of
zebulun
4
7
and
i
will
draw
unto
thee
to
the
river
kishon
sisera
the
captain
of
jabin’s
army
with
his
chariots
and
his
multitude
and
i
will
deliver
him
into
thine
hand
4
8
and
barak
said
unto
her
if
thou
wilt
go
with
me
then
i
will
go
but
if
thou
wilt
not
go
with
me
then
i
will
not
go
4
9
and
she
said
i
will
surely
go
with
thee
notwithstanding
the
journey
that
thou
takest
shall
not
be
for
thine
honour
for
the
lord
shall
sell
sisera
into
the
hand
of
a
woman
and
deborah
arose
and
went
with
barak
to
kedesh
4
10
and
barak
called
zebulun
and
naphtali
to
kedesh
and
he
went
up
with
ten
thousand
men
at
his
feet
and
deborah
went
up
with
him
4
11
now
heber
the
kenite
which
was
of
the
children
of
hobab
the
father
in
law
of
moses
had
severed
himself
from
the
kenites
and
pitched
his
tent
unto
the
plain
of
zaanaim
which
is
by
kedesh
4
12
and
they
shewed
sisera
that
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
was
gone
up
to
mount
tabor
4
13
and
sisera
gathered
together
all
his
chariots
even
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
unto
the
river
of
kishon
4
14
and
deborah
said
unto
barak
up
for
this
is
the
day
in
which
the
lord
hath
delivered
sisera
into
thine
hand
is
not
the
lord
gone
out
before
thee
so
barak
went
down
from
mount
tabor
and
ten
thousand
men
after
him
4
15
and
the
lord
discomfited
sisera
and
all
his
chariots
and
all
his
host
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
before
barak
so
that
sisera
lighted
down
off
his
chariot
and
fled
away
on
his
feet
4
16
but
barak
pursued
after
the
chariots
and
after
the
host
unto
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
and
all
the
host
of
sisera
fell
upon
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
there
was
not
a
man
left
4
17
howbeit
sisera
fled
away
on
his
feet
to
the
tent
of
jael
the
wife
of
heber
the
kenite
for
there
was
peace
between
jabin
the
king
of
hazor
and
the
house
of
heber
the
kenite
4
18
and
jael
went
out
to
meet
sisera
and
said
unto
him
turn
in
my
lord
turn
in
to
me
fear
not
and
when
he
had
turned
in
unto
her
into
the
tent
she
covered
him
with
a
mantle
4
19
and
he
said
unto
her
give
me
i
pray
thee
a
little
water
to
drink
for
i
am
thirsty
and
she
opened
a
bottle
of
milk
and
gave
him
drink
and
covered
him
4
20
again
he
said
unto
her
stand
in
the
door
of
the
tent
and
it
shall
be
when
any
man
doth
come
and
enquire
of
thee
and
say
is
there
any
man
here
that
thou
shalt
say
no
4
21
then
jael
heber’s
wife
took
a
nail
of
the
tent
and
took
an
hammer
in
her
hand
and
went
softly
unto
him
and
smote
the
nail
into
his
temples
and
fastened
it
into
the
ground
for
he
was
fast
asleep
and
weary
so
he
died
4
22
and
behold
as
barak
pursued
sisera
jael
came
out
to
meet
him
and
said
unto
him
come
and
i
will
shew
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
and
when
he
came
into
her
tent
behold
sisera
lay
dead
and
the
nail
was
in
his
temples
4
23
so
god
subdued
on
that
day
jabin
the
king
of
canaan
before
the
children
of
israel
4
24
and
the
hand
of
the
children
of
israel
prospered
and
prevailed
against
jabin
the
king
of
canaan
until
they
had
destroyed
jabin
king
of
canaan
5

then
sang
deborah
and
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
on
that
day
saying
5

praise
ye
the

for

the

melted
from

in
the

in
the

the

were
unoccupied

the
inhabitants
of
the

ceased
in
israel
until
that
i
deborah
arose
that
i
arose
a
mother
in
israel
5

they
chose
new
gods
then
was
war
in
the

there
a
shield
or

among
forty
thousand

my
heart
is

there
shall
they
rehearse
the
righteous

of
the

even
the
righteous
acts
toward
the
inhabitants
of

the

have

have
they
not

the

to
every
man
a

or

to

a
prey
of
divers
colours
a
prey
of

of
divers
colours
of
needlework
on
both
sides
meet
for
the
necks
of
them
that

5
31
so
let
all
thine
enemies
perish
o
lord
but
let
them
that
love
him
be
as
the
sun
when
he
goeth
forth
in
his
might
and
the
land
had
rest
forty
years
6
1
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
midian
seven
years
6
2
and
the
hand
of
midian
prevailed
against
israel
and
because
of
the
midianites
the
children
of
israel
made
them
the
dens
which
are
in
the
mountains
and
caves
and
strong
holds
6
3
and
so
it
was
when
israel
had
sown
that
the
midianites
came
up
and
the
amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
even
they
came
up
against
them
6
4
and
they
encamped
against
them
and
destroyed
the
increase
of
the
earth
till
thou
come
unto
gaza
and
left
no
sustenance
for
israel
neither
sheep
nor
ox
nor
ass
6
5
for
they
came
up
with
their
cattle
and
their
tents
and
they
came
as
grasshoppers
for
multitude
for
both
they
and
their
camels
were
without
number
and
they
entered
into
the
land
to
destroy
it
6
6
and
israel
was
greatly
impoverished
because
of
the
midianites
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
6
7
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
because
of
the
midianites
6
8
that
the
lord
sent
a
prophet
unto
the
children
of
israel
which
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
brought
you
up
from
egypt
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
6
9
and
i
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
that
oppressed
you
and
drave
them
out
from
before
you
and
gave
you
their
land
6
10
and
i
said
unto
you
i
am
the
lord
your
god
fear
not
the
gods
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
6
11
and
there
came
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
sat
under
an
oak
which
was
in
ophrah
that
pertained
unto
joash
the
abiezrite
and
his
son
gideon
threshed
wheat
by
the
winepress
to
hide
it
from
the
midianites
6
12
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
the
lord
is
with
thee
thou
mighty
man
of
valour
6
13
and
gideon
said
unto
him
oh
my
lord
if
the
lord
be
with
us
why
then
is
all
this
befallen
us
and
where
be
all
his
miracles
which
our
fathers
told
us
of
saying
did
not
the
lord
bring
us
up
from
egypt
but
now
the
lord
hath
forsaken
us
and
delivered
us
into
the
hands
of
the
midianites
6
14
and
the
lord
looked
upon
him
and
said
go
in
this
thy
might
and
thou
shalt
save
israel
from
the
hand
of
the
midianites
have
not
i
sent
thee
6
15
and
he
said
unto
him
oh
my
lord
wherewith
shall
i
save
israel
behold
my
family
is
poor
in
manasseh
and
i
am
the
least
in
my
father’s
house
6
16
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
surely
i
will
be
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
midianites
as
one
man
6
17
and
he
said
unto
him
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
then
shew
me
a
sign
that
thou
talkest
with
me
6
18
depart
not
hence
i
pray
thee
until
i
come
unto
thee
and
bring
forth
my
present
and
set
it
before
thee
and
he
said
i
will
tarry
until
thou
come
again
6
19
and
gideon
went
in
and
made
ready
a
kid
and
unleavened
cakes
of
an
ephah
of
flour
the
flesh
he
put
in
a
basket
and
he
put
the
broth
in
a
pot
and
brought
it
out
unto
him
under
the
oak
and
presented
it
6
20
and
the
angel
of
god
said
unto
him
take
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
lay
them
upon
this
rock
and
pour
out
the
broth
and
he
did
so
6
21
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
put
forth
the
end
of
the
staff
that
was
in
his
hand
and
touched
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
there
rose
up
fire
out
of
the
rock
and
consumed
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
departed
out
of
his
sight
6
22
and
when
gideon
perceived
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
gideon
said
alas
o
lord
god
for
because
i
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
lord
face
to
face
6
23
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
peace
be
unto
thee
fear
not
thou
shalt
not
die
6
24
then
gideon
built
an
altar
there
unto
the
lord
and
called
it
jehovahshalom
unto
this
day
it
is
yet
in
ophrah
of
the
abiezrites
6
25
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
lord
said
unto
him
take
thy
father’s
young
bullock
even
the
second
bullock
of
seven
years
old
and
throw
down
the
altar
of
baal
that
thy
father
hath
and
cut
down
the
grove
that
is
by
it
6
26
and
build
an
altar
unto
the
lord
thy
god
upon
the
top
of
this
rock
in
the
ordered
place
and
take
the
second
bullock
and
offer
a
burnt
sacrifice
with
the
wood
of
the
grove
which
thou
shalt
cut
down
6
27
then
gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
servants
and
did
as
the
lord
had
said
unto
him
and
so
it
was
because
he
feared
his
father’s
household
and
the
men
of
the
city
that
he
could
not
do
it
by
day
that
he
did
it
by
night
6
28
and
when
the
men
of
the
city
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
the
altar
of
baal
was
cast
down
and
the
grove
was
cut
down
that
was
by
it
and
the
second
bullock
was
offered
upon
the
altar
that
was
built
6
29
and
they
said
one
to
another
who
hath
done
this
thing
and
when
they
enquired
and
asked
they
said
gideon
the
son
of
joash
hath
done
this
thing
6
30
then
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
joash
bring
out
thy
son
that
he
may
die
because
he
hath
cast
down
the
altar
of
baal
and
because
he
hath
cut
down
the
grove
that
was
by
it
6
31
and
joash
said
unto
all
that
stood
against
him
will
ye
plead
for
baal
will
ye
save
him
he
that
will
plead
for
him
let
him
be
put
to
death
whilst
it
is
yet
morning
if
he
be
a
god
let
him
plead
for
himself
because
one
hath
cast
down
his
altar
6
32
therefore
on
that
day
he
called
him
jerubbaal
saying
let
baal
plead
against
him
because
he
hath
thrown
down
his
altar
6
33
then
all
the
midianites
and
the
amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
were
gathered
together
and
went
over
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
jezreel
6
34
but
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
gideon
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
abiezer
was
gathered
after
him
6
35
and
he
sent
messengers
throughout
all
manasseh
who
also
was
gathered
after
him
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
asher
and
unto
zebulun
and
unto
naphtali
and
they
came
up
to
meet
them
6
36
and
gideon
said
unto
god
if
thou
wilt
save
israel
by
mine
hand
as
thou
hast
said
6
37
behold
i
will
put
a
fleece
of
wool
in
the
floor
and
if
the
dew
be
on
the
fleece
only
and
it
be
dry
upon
all
the
earth
beside
then
shall
i
know
that
thou
wilt
save
israel
by
mine
hand
as
thou
hast
said
6
38
and
it
was
so
for
he
rose
up
early
on
the
morrow
and
thrust
the
fleece
together
and
wringed
the
dew
out
of
the
fleece
a
bowl
full
of
water
6
39
and
gideon
said
unto
god
let
not
thine
anger
be
hot
against
me
and
i
will
speak
but
this
once
let
me
prove
i
pray
thee
but
this
once
with
the
fleece
let
it
now
be
dry
only
upon
the
fleece
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
be
dew
6
40
and
god
did
so
that
night
for
it
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
only
and
there
was
dew
on
all
the
ground
7
1
then
jerubbaal
who
is
gideon
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
rose
up
early
and
pitched
beside
the
well
of
harod
so
that
the
host
of
the
midianites
were
on
the
north
side
of
them
by
the
hill
of
moreh
in
the
valley
7
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
the
people
that
are
with
thee
are
too
many
for
me
to
give
the
midianites
into
their
hands
lest
israel
vaunt
themselves
against
me
saying
mine
own
hand
hath
saved
me
7
3
now
therefore
go
to
proclaim
in
the
ears
of
the
people
saying
whosoever
is
fearful
and
afraid
let
him
return
and
depart
early
from
mount
gilead
and
there
returned
of
the
people
twenty
and
two
thousand
and
there
remained
ten
thousand
7
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
the
people
are
yet
too
many
bring
them
down
unto
the
water
and
i
will
try
them
for
thee
there
and
it
shall
be
that
of
whom
i
say
unto
thee
this
shall
go
with
thee
the
same
shall
go
with
thee
and
of
whomsoever
i
say
unto
thee
this
shall
not
go
with
thee
the
same
shall
not
go
7

so
he
brought
down
the
people
unto
the
water
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
every
one
that
lappeth
of
the
water
with
his
tongue
as
a
dog
lappeth
him
shalt
thou
set
by
himself
likewise
every
one
that
boweth
down
upon
his
knees
to
drink
7
6
and
the
number
of
them
that
lapped
putting
their
hand
to
their
mouth
were
three
hundred
men
but
all
the
rest
of
the
people
bowed
down
upon
their
knees
to
drink
water
7
7
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
by
the
three
hundred
men
that
lapped
will
i
save
you
and
deliver
the
midianites
into
thine
hand
and
let
all
the
other
people
go
every
man
unto
his
place
7
8
so
the
people
took
victuals
in
their
hand
and
their
trumpets
and
he
sent
all
the
rest
of
israel
every
man
unto
his
tent
and
retained
those
three
hundred
men
and
the
host
of
midian
was
beneath
him
in
the
valley
7
9
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
get
thee
down
unto
the
host
for
i
have
delivered
it
into
thine
hand
7
10
but
if
thou
fear
to
go
down
go
thou
with
phurah
thy
servant
down
to
the
host
7
11
and
thou
shalt
hear
what
they
say
and
afterward
shall
thine
hands
be
strengthened
to
go
down
unto
the
host
then
went
he
down
with
phurah
his
servant
unto
the
outside
of
the
armed
men
that
were
in
the
host
7
12
and
the
midianites
and
the
amalekites
and
all
the
children
of
the
east
lay
along
in
the
valley
like
grasshoppers
for
multitude
and
their
camels
were
without
number
as
the
sand
by
the
sea
side
for
multitude
7
13
and
when
gideon
was
come
behold
there
was
a
man
that
told
a
dream
unto
his
fellow
and
said
behold
i
dreamed
a
dream
and
lo
a
cake
of
barley
bread
tumbled
into
the
host
of
midian
and
came
unto
a
tent
and
smote
it
that
it
fell
and
overturned
it
that
the
tent
lay
along
7
14
and
his
fellow
answered
and
said
this
is
nothing
else
save
the
sword
of
gideon
the
son
of
joash
a
man
of
israel
for
into
his
hand
hath
god
delivered
midian
and
all
the
host
7
15
and
it
was
so
when
gideon
heard
the
telling
of
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
that
he
worshipped
and
returned
into
the
host
of
israel
and
said
arise
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
host
of
midian
7
16
and
he
divided
the
three
hundred
men
into
three
companies
and
he
put
a
trumpet
in
every
man’s
hand
with
empty
pitchers
and
lamps
within
the
pitchers
7
17
and
he
said
unto
them
look
on
me
and
do
likewise
and
behold
when
i
come
to
the
outside
of
the
camp
it
shall
be
that
as
i
do
so
shall
ye
do
7
18
when
i
blow
with
a
trumpet
i
and
all
that
are
with
me
then
blow
ye
the
trumpets
also
on
every
side
of
all
the
camp
and
say
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
7
19
so
gideon
and
the
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
came
unto
the
outside
of
the
camp
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
watch
and
they
had
but
newly
set
the
watch
and
they
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake
the
pitchers
that
were
in
their
hands
7
20
and
the
three
companies
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake
the
pitchers
and
held
the
lamps
in
their
left
hands
and
the
trumpets
in
their
right
hands
to
blow
withal
and
they
cried
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
7
21
and
they
stood
every
man
in
his
place
round
about
the
camp
and
all
the
host
ran
and
cried
and
fled
7
22
and
the
three
hundred
blew
the
trumpets
and
the
lord
set
every
man’s
sword
against
his
fellow
even
throughout
all
the
host
and
the
host
fled
to
bethshittah
in
zererath
and
to
the
border
of
abelmeholah
unto
tabbath
7
23
and
the
men
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
naphtali
and
out
of
asher
and
out
of
all
manasseh
and
pursued
after
the
midianites
7
24
and
gideon
sent
messengers
throughout
all
mount
ephraim
saying
come
down
against
the
midianites
and
take
before
them
the
waters
unto
bethbarah
and
jordan
then
all
the
men
of
ephraim
gathered
themselves
together
and
took
the
waters
unto
bethbarah
and
jordan
7
25
and
they
took
two
princes
of
the
midianites
oreb
and
zeeb
and
they
slew
oreb
upon
the
rock
oreb
and
zeeb
they
slew
at
the
winepress
of
zeeb
and
pursued
midian
and
brought
the
heads
of
oreb
and
zeeb
to
gideon
on
the
other
side
jordan
8
1
and
the
men
of
ephraim
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
served
us
thus
that
thou
calledst
us
not
when
thou
wentest
to
fight
with
the
midianites
and
they
did
chide
with
him
sharply
8
2
and
he
said
unto
them
what
have
i
done
now
in
comparison
of
you
is
not
the
gleaning
of
the
grapes
of
ephraim
better
than
the
vintage
of
abiezer
8
3
god
hath
delivered
into
your
hands
the
princes
of
midian
oreb
and
zeeb
and
what
was
i
able
to
do
in
comparison
of
you
then
their
anger
was
abated
toward
him
when
he
had
said
that
8
4
and
gideon
came
to
jordan
and
passed
over
he
and
the
three
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
faint
yet
pursuing
them
8
5
and
he
said
unto
the
men
of
succoth
give
i
pray
you
loaves
of
bread
unto
the
people
that
follow
me
for
they
be
faint
and
i
am
pursuing
after
zebah
and
zalmunna
kings
of
midian
8
6
and
the
princes
of
succoth
said
are
the
hands
of
zebah
and
zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thine
army
8
7
and
gideon
said
therefore
when
the
lord
hath
delivered
zebah
and
zalmunna
into
mine
hand
then
i
will
tear
your
flesh
with
the
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
with
briers
8
8
and
he
went
up
thence
to
penuel
and
spake
unto
them
likewise
and
the
men
of
penuel
answered
him
as
the
men
of
succoth
had
answered
him
8
9
and
he
spake
also
unto
the
men
of
penuel
saying
when
i
come
again
in
peace
i
will
break
down
this
tower
8
10
now
zebah
and
zalmunna
were
in
karkor
and
their
hosts
with
them
about
fifteen
thousand
men
all
that
were
left
of
all
the
hosts
of
the
children
of
the
east
for
there
fell
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
8
11
and
gideon
went
up
by
the
way
of
them
that
dwelt
in
tents
on
the
east
of
nobah
and
jogbehah
and
smote
the
host
for
the
host
was
secure
8
12
and
when
zebah
and
zalmunna
fled
he
pursued
after
them
and
took
the
two
kings
of
midian
zebah
and
zalmunna
and
discomfited
all
the
host
8
13
and
gideon
the
son
of
joash
returned
from
battle
before
the
sun
was
up
8
14
and
caught
a
young
man
of
the
men
of
succoth
and
enquired
of
him
and
he
described
unto
him
the
princes
of
succoth
and
the
elders
thereof
even
threescore
and
seventeen
men
8
15
and
he
came
unto
the
men
of
succoth
and
said
behold
zebah
and
zalmunna
with
whom
ye
did
upbraid
me
saying
are
the
hands
of
zebah
and
zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thy
men
that
are
weary
8
16
and
he
took
the
elders
of
the
city
and
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
briers
and
with
them
he
taught
the
men
of
succoth
8
17
and
he
beat
down
the
tower
of
penuel
and
slew
the
men
of
the
city
8
18
then
said
he
unto
zebah
and
zalmunna
what
manner
of
men
were
they
whom
ye
slew
at
tabor
and
they
answered
as
thou
art
so
were
they
each
one
resembled
the
children
of
a
king
8
19
and
he
said
they
were
my
brethren
even
the
sons
of
my
mother
as
the
lord
liveth
if
ye
had
saved
them
alive
i
would
not
slay
you
8
20
and
he
said
unto
jether
his
firstborn
up
and
slay
them
but
the
youth
drew
not
his
sword
for
he
feared
because
he
was
yet
a
youth
8
21
then
zebah
and
zalmunna
said
rise
thou
and
fall
upon
us
for
as
the
man
is
so
is
his
strength
and
gideon
arose
and
slew
zebah
and
zalmunna
and
took
away
the
ornaments
that
were
on
their
camels’
necks
8
22
then
the
men
of
israel
said
unto
gideon
rule
thou
over
us
both
thou
and
thy
son
and
thy
son’s
son
also
for
thou
hast
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
midian
8
23
and
gideon
said
unto
them
i
will
not
rule
over
you
neither
shall
my
son
rule
over
you
the
lord
shall
rule
over
you
8
24
and
gideon
said
unto
them
i
would
desire
a
request
of
you
that
ye
would
give
me
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey
(for
they
had
golden
earrings
because
they
were
ishmaelites
)
8
25
and
they
answered
we
will
willingly
give
them
and
they
spread
a
garment
and
did
cast
therein
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey
8
26
and
the
weight
of
the
golden
earrings
that
he
requested
was
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
shekels
of
gold
beside
ornaments
and
collars
and
purple
raiment
that
was
on
the
kings
of
midian
and
beside
the
chains
that
were
about
their
camels’
necks
8
27
and
gideon
made
an
ephod
thereof
and
put
it
in
his
city
even
in
ophrah
and
all
israel
went
thither
a
whoring
after
it
which
thing
became
a
snare
unto
gideon
and
to
his
house
8
28
thus
was
midian
subdued
before
the
children
of
israel
so
that
they
lifted
up
their
heads
no
more
and
the
country
was
in
quietness
forty
years
in
the
days
of
gideon
8
29
and
jerubbaal
the
son
of
joash
went
and
dwelt
in
his
own
house
8
30
and
gideon
had
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
his
body
begotten
for
he
had
many
wives
8
31
and
his
concubine
that
was
in
shechem
she
also
bare
him
a
son
whose
name
he
called
abimelech
8
32
and
gideon
the
son
of
joash
died
in
a
good
old
age
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
joash
his
father
in
ophrah
of
the
abiezrites
8
33
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
gideon
was
dead
that
the
children
of
israel
turned
again
and
went
a
whoring
after
baalim
and
made
baalberith
their
god
8
34
and
the
children
of
israel
remembered
not
the
lord
their
god
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
all
their
enemies
on
every
side
8
35
neither
shewed
they
kindness
to
the
house
of
jerubbaal
namely
gideon
according
to
all
the
goodness
which
he
had
shewed
unto
israel
9
1
and
abimelech
the
son
of
jerubbaal
went
to
shechem
unto
his
mother’s
brethren
and
communed
with
them
and
with
all
the
family
of
the
house
of
his
mother’s
father
saying
9
2
speak
i
pray
you
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
shechem
whether
is
better
for
you
either
that
all
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
which
are
threescore
and
ten
persons
reign
over
you
or
that
one
reign
over
you
remember
also
that
i
am
your
bone
and
your
flesh
9
3
and
his
mother’s
brethren
spake
of
him
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
shechem
all
these
words
and
their
hearts
inclined
to
follow
abimelech
for
they
said
he
is
our
brother
9
4
and
they
gave
him
threescore
and
ten
pieces
of
silver
out
of
the
house
of
baalberith
wherewith
abimelech
hired
vain
and
light
persons
which
followed
him
9
5
and
he
went
unto
his
father’s
house
at
ophrah
and
slew
his
brethren
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
being
threescore
and
ten
persons
upon
one
stone
notwithstanding
yet
jotham
the
youngest
son
of
jerubbaal
was
left
for
he
hid
himself
9
6
and
all
the
men
of
shechem
gathered
together
and
all
the
house
of
millo
and
went
and
made
abimelech
king
by
the
plain
of
the
pillar
that
was
in
shechem
9
7
and
when
they
told
it
to
jotham
he
went
and
stood
in
the
top
of
mount
gerizim
and
lifted
up
his
voice
and
cried
and
said
unto
them
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
shechem
that
god
may
hearken
unto
you
9
8
the
trees
went
forth
on
a
time
to
anoint
a
king
over
them
and
they
said
unto
the
olive
tree
reign
thou
over
us
9
9
but
the
olive
tree
said
unto
them
should
i
leave
my
fatness
wherewith
by
me
they
honour
god
and
man
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
9
10
and
the
trees
said
to
the
fig
tree
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
9
11
but
the
fig
tree
said
unto
them
should
i
forsake
my
sweetness
and
my
good
fruit
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
9
12
then
said
the
trees
unto
the
vine
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
9
13
and
the
vine
said
unto
them
should
i
leave
my
wine
which
cheereth
god
and
man
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
9
14
then
said
all
the
trees
unto
the
bramble
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
9
15
and
the
bramble
said
unto
the
trees
if
in
truth
ye
anoint
me
king
over
you
then
come
and
put
your
trust
in
my
shadow
and
if
not
let
fire
come
out
of
the
bramble
and
devour
the
cedars
of
lebanon
9
16
now
therefore
if
ye
have
done
truly
and
sincerely
in
that
ye
have
made
abimelech
king
and
if
ye
have
dealt
well
with
jerubbaal
and
his
house
and
have
done
unto
him
according
to
the
deserving
of
his
hands
9
17
(for
my
father
fought
for
you
and
adventured
his
life
far
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
midian
9
18
and
ye
are
risen
up
against
my
father’s
house
this
day
and
have
slain
his
sons
threescore
and
ten
persons
upon
one
stone
and
have
made
abimelech
the
son
of
his
maidservant
king
over
the
men
of
shechem
because
he
is
your
brother
)
9
19
if
ye
then
have
dealt
truly
and
sincerely
with
jerubbaal
and
with
his
house
this
day
then
rejoice
ye
in
abimelech
and
let
him
also
rejoice
in
you
9
20
but
if
not
let
fire
come
out
from
abimelech
and
devour
the
men
of
shechem
and
the
house
of
millo
and
let
fire
come
out
from
the
men
of
shechem
and
from
the
house
of
millo
and
devour
abimelech
9
21
and
jotham
ran
away
and
fled
and
went
to
beer
and
dwelt
there
for
fear
of
abimelech
his
brother
9
22
when
abimelech
had
reigned
three
years
over
israel
9
23
then
god
sent
an
evil
spirit
between
abimelech
and
the
men
of
shechem
and
the
men
of
shechem
dealt
treacherously
with
abimelech
9
24
that
the
cruelty
done
to
the
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
jerubbaal
might
come
and
their
blood
be
laid
upon
abimelech
their
brother
which
slew
them
and
upon
the
men
of
shechem
which
aided
him
in
the
killing
of
his
brethren
9
25
and
the
men
of
shechem
set
liers
in
wait
for
him
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
they
robbed
all
that
came
along
that
way
by
them
and
it
was
told
abimelech
9
26
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
came
with
his
brethren
and
went
over
to
shechem
and
the
men
of
shechem
put
their
confidence
in
him
9
27
and
they
went
out
into
the
fields
and
gathered
their
vineyards
and
trode
the
grapes
and
made
merry
and
went
into
the
house
of
their
god
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
cursed
abimelech
9
28
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
said
who
is
abimelech
and
who
is
shechem
that
we
should
serve
him
is
not
he
the
son
of
jerubbaal
and
zebul
his
officer
serve
the
men
of
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
for
why
should
we
serve
him
9
29
and
would
to
god
this
people
were
under
my
hand
then
would
i
remove
abimelech
and
he
said
to
abimelech
increase
thine
army
and
come
out
9
30
and
when
zebul
the
ruler
of
the
city
heard
the
words
of
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
his
anger
was
kindled
9
31
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
abimelech
privily
saying
behold
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
and
his
brethren
be
come
to
shechem
and
behold
they
fortify
the
city
against
thee
9
32
now
therefore
up
by
night
thou
and
the
people
that
is
with
thee
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
field
9
33
and
it
shall
be
that
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
up
thou
shalt
rise
early
and
set
upon
the
city
and
behold
when
he
and
the
people
that
is
with
him
come
out
against
thee
then
mayest
thou
do
to
them
as
thou
shalt
find
occasion
9
34
and
abimelech
rose
up
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
by
night
and
they
laid
wait
against
shechem
in
four
companies
9
35
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
went
out
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
abimelech
rose
up
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
lying
in
wait
9
36
and
when
gaal
saw
the
people
he
said
to
zebul
behold
there
come
people
down
from
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
zebul
said
unto
him
thou
seest
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
men
9
37
and
gaal
spake
again
and
said
see
there
come
people
down
by
the
middle
of
the
land
and
another
company
come
along
by
the
plain
of
meonenim
9
38
then
said
zebul
unto
him
where
is
now
thy
mouth
wherewith
thou
saidst
who
is
abimelech
that
we
should
serve
him
is
not
this
the
people
that
thou
hast
despised
go
out
i
pray
now
and
fight
with
them
9
39
and
gaal
went
out
before
the
men
of
shechem
and
fought
with
abimelech
9
40
and
abimelech
chased
him
and
he
fled
before
him
and
many
were
overthrown
and
wounded
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate
9
41
and
abimelech
dwelt
at
arumah
and
zebul
thrust
out
gaal
and
his
brethren
that
they
should
not
dwell
in
shechem
9
42
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
and
they
told
abimelech
9
43
and
he
took
the
people
and
divided
them
into
three
companies
and
laid
wait
in
the
field
and
looked
and
behold
the
people
were
come
forth
out
of
the
city
and
he
rose
up
against
them
and
smote
them
9
44
and
abimelech
and
the
company
that
was
with
him
rushed
forward
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
two
other
companies
ran
upon
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
fields
and
slew
them
9
45
and
abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
day
and
he
took
the
city
and
slew
the
people
that
was
therein
and
beat
down
the
city
and
sowed
it
with
salt
9
46
and
when
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
heard
that
they
entered
into
an
hold
of
the
house
of
the
god
berith
9
47
and
it
was
told
abimelech
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
were
gathered
together
9
48
and
abimelech
gat
him
up
to
mount
zalmon
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
abimelech
took
an
axe
in
his
hand
and
cut
down
a
bough
from
the
trees
and
took
it
and
laid
it
on
his
shoulder
and
said
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
what
ye
have
seen
me
do
make
haste
and
do
as
i
have
done
9
49
and
all
the
people
likewise
cut
down
every
man
his
bough
and
followed
abimelech
and
put
them
to
the
hold
and
set
the
hold
on
fire
upon
them
so
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
died
also
about
a
thousand
men
and
women
9
50
then
went
abimelech
to
thebez
and
encamped
against
thebez
and
took
it
9
51
but
there
was
a
strong
tower
within
the
city
and
thither
fled
all
the
men
and
women
and
all
they
of
the
city
and
shut
it
to
them
and
gat
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
9
52
and
abimelech
came
unto
the
tower
and
fought
against
it
and
went
hard
unto
the
door
of
the
tower
to
burn
it
with
fire
9
53
and
a
certain
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
abimelech’s
head
and
all
to
brake
his
skull
9
54
then
he
called
hastily
unto
the
young
man
his
armourbearer
and
said
unto
him
draw
thy
sword
and
slay
me
that
men
say
not
of
me
a
women
slew
him
and
his
young
man
thrust
him
through
and
he
died
9
55
and
when
the
men
of
israel
saw
that
abimelech
was
dead
they
departed
every
man
unto
his
place
9
56
thus
god
rendered
the
wickedness
of
abimelech
which
he
did
unto
his
father
in
slaying
his
seventy
brethren
9
57
and
all
the
evil
of
the
men
of
shechem
did
god
render
upon
their
heads
and
upon
them
came
the
curse
of
jotham
the
son
of
jerubbaal
10
1
and
after
abimelech
there
arose
to
defend
israel
tola
the
son
of
puah
the
son
of
dodo
a
man
of
issachar
and
he
dwelt
in
shamir
in
mount
ephraim
10
2
and
he
judged
israel
twenty
and
three
years
and
died
and
was
buried
in
shamir
10
3
and
after
him
arose
jair
a
gileadite
and
judged
israel
twenty
and
two
years
10
4
and
he
had
thirty
sons
that
rode
on
thirty
ass
colts
and
they
had
thirty
cities
which
are
called
havothjair
unto
this
day
which
are
in
the
land
of
gilead
10
5
and
jair
died
and
was
buried
in
camon
10
6
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
the
gods
of
syria
and
the
gods
of
zidon
and
the
gods
of
moab
and
the
gods
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
gods
of
the
philistines
and
forsook
the
lord
and
served
not
him
10
7
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
into
the
hands
of
the
children
of
ammon
10
8
and
that
year
they
vexed
and
oppressed
the
children
of
israel
eighteen
years
all
the
children
of
israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
in
the
land
of
the
amorites
which
is
in
gilead
10
9
moreover
the
children
of
ammon
passed
over
jordan
to
fight
also
against
judah
and
against
benjamin
and
against
the
house
of
ephraim
so
that
israel
was
sore
distressed
10
10
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
we
have
sinned
against
thee
both
because
we
have
forsaken
our
god
and
also
served
baalim
10
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
did
not
i
deliver
you
from
the
egyptians
and
from
the
amorites
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
from
the
philistines
10
12
the
zidonians
also
and
the
amalekites
and
the
maonites
did
oppress
you
and
ye
cried
to
me
and
i
delivered
you
out
of
their
hand
10
13
yet
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
wherefore
i
will
deliver
you
no
more
10
14
go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
which
ye
have
chosen
let
them
deliver
you
in
the
time
of
your
tribulation
10
15
and
the
children
of
israel
said
unto
the
lord
we
have
sinned
do
thou
unto
us
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee
deliver
us
only
we
pray
thee
this
day
10
16
and
they
put
away
the
strange
gods
from
among
them
and
served
the
lord
and
his
soul
was
grieved
for
the
misery
of
israel
10
17
then
the
children
of
ammon
were
gathered
together
and
encamped
in
gilead
and
the
children
of
israel
assembled
themselves
together
and
encamped
in
mizpeh
10
18
and
the
people
and
princes
of
gilead
said
one
to
another
what
man
is
he
that
will
begin
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
he
shall
be
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
11
1
now
jephthah
the
gileadite
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
he
was
the
son
of
an
harlot
and
gilead
begat
jephthah
11
2
and
gilead’s
wife
bare
him
sons
and
his
wife’s
sons
grew
up
and
they
thrust
out
jephthah
and
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
inherit
in
our
father’s
house
for
thou
art
the
son
of
a
strange
woman
11
3
then
jephthah
fled
from
his
brethren
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
tob
and
there
were
gathered
vain
men
to
jephthah
and
went
out
with
him
11
4
and
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
time
that
the
children
of
ammon
made
war
against
israel
11
5
and
it
was
so
that
when
the
children
of
ammon
made
war
against
israel
the
elders
of
gilead
went
to
fetch
jephthah
out
of
the
land
of
tob
11
6
and
they
said
unto
jephthah
come
and
be
our
captain
that
we
may
fight
with
the
children
of
ammon
11
7
and
jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
gilead
did
not
ye
hate
me
and
expel
me
out
of
my
father’s
house
and
why
are
ye
come
unto
me
now
when
ye
are
in
distress
11
8
and
the
elders
of
gilead
said
unto
jephthah
therefore
we
turn
again
to
thee
now
that
thou
mayest
go
with
us
and
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
be
our
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
11
9
and
jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
gilead
if
ye
bring
me
home
again
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
lord
deliver
them
before
me
shall
i
be
your
head
11
10
and
the
elders
of
gilead
said
unto
jephthah
the
lord
be
witness
between
us
if
we
do
not
so
according
to
thy
words
11
11
then
jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
gilead
and
the
people
made
him
head
and
captain
over
them
and
jephthah
uttered
all
his
words
before
the
lord
in
mizpeh
11
12
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
saying
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
me
that
thou
art
come
against
me
to
fight
in
my
land
11
13
and
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
of
jephthah
because
israel
took
away
my
land
when
they
came
up
out
of
egypt
from
arnon
even
unto
jabbok
and
unto
jordan
now
therefore
restore
those
lands
again
peaceably
11
14
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
again
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
11
15
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
jephthah
israel
took
not
away
the
land
of
moab
nor
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
11
16
but
when
israel
came
up
from
egypt
and
walked
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
red
sea
and
came
to
kadesh
11
17
then
israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
edom
saying
let
me
i
pray
thee
pass
through
thy
land
but
the
king
of
edom
would
not
hearken
thereto
and
in
like
manner
they
sent
unto
the
king
of
moab
but
he
would
not
consent
and
israel
abode
in
kadesh
11
18
then
they
went
along
through
the
wilderness
and
compassed
the
land
of
edom
and
the
land
of
moab
and
came
by
the
east
side
of
the
land
of
moab
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
arnon
but
came
not
within
the
border
of
moab
for
arnon
was
the
border
of
moab
11
19
and
israel
sent
messengers
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
the
king
of
heshbon
and
israel
said
unto
him
let
us
pass
we
pray
thee
through
thy
land
into
my
place
11
20
but
sihon
trusted
not
israel
to
pass
through
his
coast
but
sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
pitched
in
jahaz
and
fought
against
israel
11
21
and
the
lord
god
of
israel
delivered
sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
of
israel
and
they
smote
them
so
israel
possessed
all
the
land
of
the
amorites
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
11
22
and
they
possessed
all
the
coasts
of
the
amorites
from
arnon
even
unto
jabbok
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
jordan
11
23
so
now
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
dispossessed
the
amorites
from
before
his
people
israel
and
shouldest
thou
possess
it
11
24
wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
so
whomsoever
the
lord
our
god
shall
drive
out
from
before
us
them
will
we
possess
11
25
and
now
art
thou
any
thing
better
than
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
did
he
ever
strive
against
israel
or
did
he
ever
fight
against
them
11
26
while
israel
dwelt
in
heshbon
and
her
towns
and
in
aroer
and
her
towns
and
in
all
the
cities
that
be
along
by
the
coasts
of
arnon
three
hundred
years
why
therefore
did
ye
not
recover
them
within
that
time
11
27
wherefore
i
have
not
sinned
against
thee
but
thou
doest
me
wrong
to
war
against
me
the
lord
the
judge
be
judge
this
day
between
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
ammon
11
28
howbeit
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
jephthah
which
he
sent
him
11
29
then
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
jephthah
and
he
passed
over
gilead
and
manasseh
and
passed
over
mizpeh
of
gilead
and
from
mizpeh
of
gilead
he
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
11
30
and
jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
said
if
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
ammon
into
mine
hands
11
31
then
it
shall
be
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
me
when
i
return
in
peace
from
the
children
of
ammon
shall
surely
be
the
lord’s
and
i
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
offering
11
32
so
jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
to
fight
against
them
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
his
hands
11
33
and
he
smote
them
from
aroer
even
till
thou
come
to
minnith
even
twenty
cities
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
vineyards
with
a
very
great
slaughter
thus
the
children
of
ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
israel
11
34
and
jephthah
came
to
mizpeh
unto
his
house
and
behold
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
dances
and
she
was
his
only
child
beside
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
11
35
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
saw
her
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
said
alas
my
daughter
thou
hast
brought
me
very
low
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
me
for
i
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
lord
and
i
cannot
go
back
11
36
and
she
said
unto
him
my
father
if
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
lord
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
thy
mouth
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
enemies
even
of
the
children
of
ammon
11
37
and
she
said
unto
her
father
let
this
thing
be
done
for
me
let
me
alone
two
months
that
i
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
mountains
and
bewail
my
virginity
i
and
my
fellows
11
38
and
he
said
go
and
he
sent
her
away
for
two
months
and
she
went
with
her
companions
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
mountains
11
39
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
months
that
she
returned
unto
her
father
who
did
with
her
according
to
his
vow
which
he
had
vowed
and
she
knew
no
man
and
it
was
a
custom
in
israel
11
40
that
the
daughters
of
israel
went
yearly
to
lament
the
daughter
of
jephthah
the
gileadite
four
days
in
a
year
12
1
and
the
men
of
ephraim
gathered
themselves
together
and
went
northward
and
said
unto
jephthah
wherefore
passedst
thou
over
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
didst
not
call
us
to
go
with
thee
we
will
burn
thine
house
upon
thee
with
fire
12
2
and
jephthah
said
unto
them
i
and
my
people
were
at
great
strife
with
the
children
of
ammon
and
when
i
called
you
ye
delivered
me
not
out
of
their
hands
12
3
and
when
i
saw
that
ye
delivered
me
not
i
put
my
life
in
my
hands
and
passed
over
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
my
hand
wherefore
then
are
ye
come
up
unto
me
this
day
to
fight
against
me
12
4
then
jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
gilead
and
fought
with
ephraim
and
the
men
of
gilead
smote
ephraim
because
they
said
ye
gileadites
are
fugitives
of
ephraim
among
the
ephraimites
and
among
the
manassites
12
5
and
the
gileadites
took
the
passages
of
jordan
before
the
ephraimites
and
it
was
so
that
when
those
ephraimites
which
were
escaped
said
let
me
go
over
that
the
men
of
gilead
said
unto
him
art
thou
an
ephraimite
if
he
said
nay
12
6
then
said
they
unto
him
say
now
shibboleth
and
he
said
sibboleth
for
he
could
not
frame
to
pronounce
it
right
then
they
took
him
and
slew
him
at
the
passages
of
jordan
and
there
fell
at
that
time
of
the
ephraimites
forty
and
two
thousand
12
7
and
jephthah
judged
israel
six
years
then
died
jephthah
the
gileadite
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
cities
of
gilead
12
8
and
after
him
ibzan
of
bethlehem
judged
israel
12
9
and
he
had
thirty
sons
and
thirty
daughters
whom
he
sent
abroad
and
took
in
thirty
daughters
from
abroad
for
his
sons
and
he
judged
israel
seven
years
12
10
then
died
ibzan
and
was
buried
at
bethlehem
12
11
and
after
him
elon
a
zebulonite
judged
israel
and
he
judged
israel
ten
years
12
12
and
elon
the
zebulonite
died
and
was
buried
in
aijalon
in
the
country
of
zebulun
12
13
and
after
him
abdon
the
son
of
hillel
a
pirathonite
judged
israel
12
14
and
he
had
forty
sons
and
thirty
nephews
that
rode
on
threescore
and
ten
ass
colts
and
he
judged
israel
eight
years
12
15
and
abdon
the
son
of
hillel
the
pirathonite
died
and
was
buried
in
pirathon
in
the
land
of
ephraim
in
the
mount
of
the
amalekites
13
1
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
forty
years
13
2
and
there
was
a
certain
man
of
zorah
of
the
family
of
the
danites
whose
name
was
manoah
and
his
wife
was
barren
and
bare
not
13
3
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
the
woman
and
said
unto
her
behold
now
thou
art
barren
and
bearest
not
but
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
13
4
now
therefore
beware
i
pray
thee
and
drink
not
wine
nor
strong
drink
and
eat
not
any
unclean
thing
13
5
for
lo
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
no
razor
shall
come
on
his
head
for
the
child
shall
be
a
nazarite
unto
god
from
the
womb
and
he
shall
begin
to
deliver
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
13
6
then
the
woman
came
and
told
her
husband
saying
a
man
of
god
came
unto
me
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
countenance
of
an
angel
of
god
very
terrible
but
i
asked
him
not
whence
he
was
neither
told
he
me
his
name
13
7
but
he
said
unto
me
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
now
drink
no
wine
nor
strong
drink
neither
eat
any
unclean
thing
for
the
child
shall
be
a
nazarite
to
god
from
the
womb
to
the
day
of
his
death
13
8
then
manoah
intreated
the
lord
and
said
o
my
lord
let
the
man
of
god
which
thou
didst
send
come
again
unto
us
and
teach
us
what
we
shall
do
unto
the
child
that
shall
be
born
13
9
and
god
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
manoah
and
the
angel
of
god
came
again
unto
the
woman
as
she
sat
in
the
field
but
manoah
her
husband
was
not
with
her
13
10
and
the
woman
made
haste
and
ran
and
shewed
her
husband
and
said
unto
him
behold
the
man
hath
appeared
unto
me
that
came
unto
me
the
other
day
13
11
and
manoah
arose
and
went
after
his
wife
and
came
to
the
man
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
man
that
spakest
unto
the
woman
and
he
said
i
am
13
12
and
manoah
said
now
let
thy
words
come
to
pass
how
shall
we
order
the
child
and
how
shall
we
do
unto
him
13
13
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
manoah
of
all
that
i
said
unto
the
woman
let
her
beware
13
14
she
may
not
eat
of
any
thing
that
cometh
of
the
vine
neither
let
her
drink
wine
or
strong
drink
nor
eat
any
unclean
thing
all
that
i
commanded
her
let
her
observe
13
15
and
manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
i
pray
thee
let
us
detain
thee
until
we
shall
have
made
ready
a
kid
for
thee
13
16
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
manoah
though
thou
detain
me
i
will
not
eat
of
thy
bread
and
if
thou
wilt
offer
a
burnt
offering
thou
must
offer
it
unto
the
lord
for
manoah
knew
not
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
13
17
and
manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
what
is
thy
name
that
when
thy
sayings
come
to
pass
we
may
do
thee
honour
13
18
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
why
askest
thou
thus
after
my
name
seeing
it
is
secret
13
19
so
manoah
took
a
kid
with
a
meat
offering
and
offered
it
upon
a
rock
unto
the
lord
and
the
angel
did
wonderously
and
manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
13
20
for
it
came
to
pass
when
the
flame
went
up
toward
heaven
from
off
the
altar
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
ascended
in
the
flame
of
the
altar
and
manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
it
and
fell
on
their
faces
to
the
ground
13
21
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
did
no
more
appear
to
manoah
and
to
his
wife
then
manoah
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
13
22
and
manoah
said
unto
his
wife
we
shall
surely
die
because
we
have
seen
god
13
23
but
his
wife
said
unto
him
if
the
lord
were
pleased
to
kill
us
he
would
not
have
received
a
burnt
offering
and
a
meat
offering
at
our
hands
neither
would
he
have
shewed
us
all
these
things
nor
would
as
at
this
time
have
told
us
such
things
as
these
13
24
and
the
woman
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
samson
and
the
child
grew
and
the
lord
blessed
him
13
25
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
began
to
move
him
at
times
in
the
camp
of
dan
between
zorah
and
eshtaol
14
1
and
samson
went
down
to
timnath
and
saw
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
14
2
and
he
came
up
and
told
his
father
and
his
mother
and
said
i
have
seen
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
now
therefore
get
her
for
me
to
wife
14
3
then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
is
there
never
a
woman
among
the
daughters
of
thy
brethren
or
among
all
my
people
that
thou
goest
to
take
a
wife
of
the
uncircumcised
philistines
and
samson
said
unto
his
father
get
her
for
me
for
she
pleaseth
me
well
14
4
but
his
father
and
his
mother
knew
not
that
it
was
of
the
lord
that
he
sought
an
occasion
against
the
philistines
for
at
that
time
the
philistines
had
dominion
over
israel
14
5
then
went
samson
down
and
his
father
and
his
mother
to
timnath
and
came
to
the
vineyards
of
timnath
and
behold
a
young
lion
roared
against
him
14
6
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
mightily
upon
him
and
he
rent
him
as
he
would
have
rent
a
kid
and
he
had
nothing
in
his
hand
but
he
told
not
his
father
or
his
mother
what
he
had
done
14
7
and
he
went
down
and
talked
with
the
woman
and
she
pleased
samson
well
14
8
and
after
a
time
he
returned
to
take
her
and
he
turned
aside
to
see
the
carcase
of
the
lion
and
behold
there
was
a
swarm
of
bees
and
honey
in
the
carcase
of
the
lion
14
9
and
he
took
thereof
in
his
hands
and
went
on
eating
and
came
to
his
father
and
mother
and
he
gave
them
and
they
did
eat
but
he
told
not
them
that
he
had
taken
the
honey
out
of
the
carcase
of
the
lion
14
10
so
his
father
went
down
unto
the
woman
and
samson
made
there
a
feast
for
so
used
the
young
men
to
do
14
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
saw
him
that
they
brought
thirty
companions
to
be
with
him
14
12
and
samson
said
unto
them
i
will
now
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
you
if
ye
can
certainly
declare
it
me
within
the
seven
days
of
the
feast
and
find
it
out
then
i
will
give
you
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments
14
13
but
if
ye
cannot
declare
it
me
then
shall
ye
give
me
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments
and
they
said
unto
him
put
forth
thy
riddle
that
we
may
hear
it
14
14
and
he
said
unto
them
out
of
the
eater
came
forth
meat
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
and
they
could
not
in
three
days
expound
the
riddle
14
15
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
they
said
unto
samson’s
wife
entice
thy
husband
that
he
may
declare
unto
us
the
riddle
lest
we
burn
thee
and
thy
father’s
house
with
fire
have
ye
called
us
to
take
that
we
have
is
it
not
so
14
16
and
samson’s
wife
wept
before
him
and
said
thou
dost
but
hate
me
and
lovest
me
not
thou
hast
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
the
children
of
my
people
and
hast
not
told
it
me
and
he
said
unto
her
behold
i
have
not
told
it
my
father
nor
my
mother
and
shall
i
tell
it
thee
14
17
and
she
wept
before
him
the
seven
days
while
their
feast
lasted
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
he
told
her
because
she
lay
sore
upon
him
and
she
told
the
riddle
to
the
children
of
her
people
14
18
and
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
him
on
the
seventh
day
before
the
sun
went
down
what
is
sweeter
than
honey
and
what
is
stronger
than
a
lion
and
he
said
unto
them
if
ye
had
not
plowed
with
my
heifer
ye
had
not
found
out
my
riddle
14
19
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
he
went
down
to
ashkelon
and
slew
thirty
men
of
them
and
took
their
spoil
and
gave
change
of
garments
unto
them
which
expounded
the
riddle
and
his
anger
was
kindled
and
he
went
up
to
his
father’s
house
14
20
but
samson’s
wife
was
given
to
his
companion
whom
he
had
used
as
his
friend
15
1
but
it
came
to
pass
within
a
while
after
in
the
time
of
wheat
harvest
that
samson
visited
his
wife
with
a
kid
and
he
said
i
will
go
in
to
my
wife
into
the
chamber
but
her
father
would
not
suffer
him
to
go
in
15
2
and
her
father
said
i
verily
thought
that
thou
hadst
utterly
hated
her
therefore
i
gave
her
to
thy
companion
is
not
her
younger
sister
fairer
than
she
take
her
i
pray
thee
instead
of
her
15
3
and
samson
said
concerning
them
now
shall
i
be
more
blameless
than
the
philistines
though
i
do
them
a
displeasure
15
4
and
samson
went
and
caught
three
hundred
foxes
and
took
firebrands
and
turned
tail
to
tail
and
put
a
firebrand
in
the
midst
between
two
tails
15
5
and
when
he
had
set
the
brands
on
fire
he
let
them
go
into
the
standing
corn
of
the
philistines
and
burnt
up
both
the
shocks
and
also
the
standing
corn
with
the
vineyards
and
olives
15
6
then
the
philistines
said
who
hath
done
this
and
they
answered
samson
the
son
in
law
of
the
timnite
because
he
had
taken
his
wife
and
given
her
to
his
companion
and
the
philistines
came
up
and
burnt
her
and
her
father
with
fire
15
7
and
samson
said
unto
them
though
ye
have
done
this
yet
will
i
be
avenged
of
you
and
after
that
i
will
cease
15
8
and
he
smote
them
hip
and
thigh
with
a
great
slaughter
and
he
went
down
and
dwelt
in
the
top
of
the
rock
etam
15
9
then
the
philistines
went
up
and
pitched
in
judah
and
spread
themselves
in
lehi
15
10
and
the
men
of
judah
said
why
are
ye
come
up
against
us
and
they
answered
to
bind
samson
are
we
come
up
to
do
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
us
15
11
then
three
thousand
men
of
judah
went
to
the
top
of
the
rock
etam
and
said
to
samson
knowest
thou
not
that
the
philistines
are
rulers
over
us
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
unto
us
and
he
said
unto
them
as
they
did
unto
me
so
have
i
done
unto
them
15
12
and
they
said
unto
him
we
are
come
down
to
bind
thee
that
we
may
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
samson
said
unto
them
swear
unto
me
that
ye
will
not
fall
upon
me
yourselves
15
13
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
no
but
we
will
bind
thee
fast
and
deliver
thee
into
their
hand
but
surely
we
will
not
kill
thee
and
they
bound
him
with
two
new
cords
and
brought
him
up
from
the
rock
15
14
and
when
he
came
unto
lehi
the
philistines
shouted
against
him
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
mightily
upon
him
and
the
cords
that
were
upon
his
arms
became
as
flax
that
was
burnt
with
fire
and
his
bands
loosed
from
off
his
hands
15
15
and
he
found
a
new
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
put
forth
his
hand
and
took
it
and
slew
a
thousand
men
therewith
15
16
and
samson
said
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
heaps
upon
heaps
with
the
jaw
of
an
ass
have
i
slain
a
thousand
men
15
17
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
that
he
cast
away
the
jawbone
out
of
his
hand
and
called
that
place
ramathlehi
15
18
and
he
was
sore
athirst
and
called
on
the
lord
and
said
thou
hast
given
this
great
deliverance
into
the
hand
of
thy
servant
and
now
shall
i
die
for
thirst
and
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
uncircumcised
15
19
but
god
clave
an
hollow
place
that
was
in
the
jaw
and
there
came
water
thereout
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
spirit
came
again
and
he
revived
wherefore
he
called
the
name
thereof
enhakkore
which
is
in
lehi
unto
this
day
15
20
and
he
judged
israel
in
the
days
of
the
philistines
twenty
years
16
1
then
went
samson
to
gaza
and
saw
there
an
harlot
and
went
in
unto
her
16
2
and
it
was
told
the
gazites
saying
samson
is
come
hither
and
they
compassed
him
in
and
laid
wait
for
him
all
night
in
the
gate
of
the
city
and
were
quiet
all
the
night
saying
in
the
morning
when
it
is
day
we
shall
kill
him
16
3
and
samson
lay
till
midnight
and
arose
at
midnight
and
took
the
doors
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
two
posts
and
went
away
with
them
bar
and
all
and
put
them
upon
his
shoulders
and
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
an
hill
that
is
before
hebron
16
4
and
it
came
to
pass
afterward
that
he
loved
a
woman
in
the
valley
of
sorek
whose
name
was
delilah
16
5
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
came
up
unto
her
and
said
unto
her
entice
him
and
see
wherein
his
great
strength
lieth
and
by
what
means
we
may
prevail
against
him
that
we
may
bind
him
to
afflict
him
and
we
will
give
thee
every
one
of
us
eleven
hundred
pieces
of
silver
16
6
and
delilah
said
to
samson
tell
me
i
pray
thee
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth
and
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
to
afflict
thee
16
7
and
samson
said
unto
her
if
they
bind
me
with
seven
green
withs
that
were
never
dried
then
shall
i
be
weak
and
be
as
another
man
16
8
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
brought
up
to
her
seven
green
withs
which
had
not
been
dried
and
she
bound
him
with
them
16
9
now
there
were
men
lying
in
wait
abiding
with
her
in
the
chamber
and
she
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
brake
the
withs
as
a
thread
of
tow
is
broken
when
it
toucheth
the
fire
so
his
strength
was
not
known
16
10
and
delilah
said
unto
samson
behold
thou
hast
mocked
me
and
told
me
lies
now
tell
me
i
pray
thee
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
16
11
and
he
said
unto
her
if
they
bind
me
fast
with
new
ropes
that
never
were
occupied
then
shall
i
be
weak
and
be
as
another
man
16
12
delilah
therefore
took
new
ropes
and
bound
him
therewith
and
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
there
were
liers
in
wait
abiding
in
the
chamber
and
he
brake
them
from
off
his
arms
like
a
thread
16
13
and
delilah
said
unto
samson
hitherto
thou
hast
mocked
me
and
told
me
lies
tell
me
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
and
he
said
unto
her
if
thou
weavest
the
seven
locks
of
my
head
with
the
web
16
14
and
she
fastened
it
with
the
pin
and
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
awaked
out
of
his
sleep
and
went
away
with
the
pin
of
the
beam
and
with
the
web
16
15
and
she
said
unto
him
how
canst
thou
say
i
love
thee
when
thine
heart
is
not
with
me
thou
hast
mocked
me
these
three
times
and
hast
not
told
me
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth
16
16
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words
and
urged
him
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
death
16
17
that
he
told
her
all
his
heart
and
said
unto
her
there
hath
not
come
a
razor
upon
mine
head
for
i
have
been
a
nazarite
unto
god
from
my
mother’s
womb
if
i
be
shaven
then
my
strength
will
go
from
me
and
i
shall
become
weak
and
be
like
any
other
man
16
18
and
when
delilah
saw
that
he
had
told
her
all
his
heart
she
sent
and
called
for
the
lords
of
the
philistines
saying
come
up
this
once
for
he
hath
shewed
me
all
his
heart
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
came
up
unto
her
and
brought
money
in
their
hand
16
19
and
she
made
him
sleep
upon
her
knees
and
she
called
for
a
man
and
she
caused
him
to
shave
off
the
seven
locks
of
his
head
and
she
began
to
afflict
him
and
his
strength
went
from
him
16
20
and
she
said
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
awoke
out
of
his
sleep
and
said
i
will
go
out
as
at
other
times
before
and
shake
myself
and
he
wist
not
that
the
lord
was
departed
from
him
16
21
but
the
philistines
took
him
and
put
out
his
eyes
and
brought
him
down
to
gaza
and
bound
him
with
fetters
of
brass
and
he
did
grind
in
the
prison
house
16
22
howbeit
the
hair
of
his
head
began
to
grow
again
after
he
was
shaven
16
23
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
gathered
them
together
for
to
offer
a
great
sacrifice
unto
dagon
their
god
and
to
rejoice
for
they
said
our
god
hath
delivered
samson
our
enemy
into
our
hand
16
24
and
when
the
people
saw
him
they
praised
their
god
for
they
said
our
god
hath
delivered
into
our
hands
our
enemy
and
the
destroyer
of
our
country
which
slew
many
of
us
16
25
and
it
came
to
pass
when
their
hearts
were
merry
that
they
said
call
for
samson
that
he
may
make
us
sport
and
they
called
for
samson
out
of
the
prison
house
and
he
made
them
sport
and
they
set
him
between
the
pillars
16
26
and
samson
said
unto
the
lad
that
held
him
by
the
hand
suffer
me
that
i
may
feel
the
pillars
whereupon
the
house
standeth
that
i
may
lean
upon
them
16
27
now
the
house
was
full
of
men
and
women
and
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
were
there
and
there
were
upon
the
roof
about
three
thousand
men
and
women
that
beheld
while
samson
made
sport
16
28
and
samson
called
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
remember
me
i
pray
thee
and
strengthen
me
i
pray
thee
only
this
once
o
god
that
i
may
be
at
once
avenged
of
the
philistines
for
my
two
eyes
16
29
and
samson
took
hold
of
the
two
middle
pillars
upon
which
the
house
stood
and
on
which
it
was
borne
up
of
the
one
with
his
right
hand
and
of
the
other
with
his
left
16
30
and
samson
said
let
me
die
with
the
philistines
and
he
bowed
himself
with
all
his
might
and
the
house
fell
upon
the
lords
and
upon
all
the
people
that
were
therein
so
the
dead
which
he
slew
at
his
death
were
more
than
they
which
he
slew
in
his
life
16
31
then
his
brethren
and
all
the
house
of
his
father
came
down
and
took
him
and
brought
him
up
and
buried
him
between
zorah
and
eshtaol
in
the
buryingplace
of
manoah
his
father
and
he
judged
israel
twenty
years
17
1
and
there
was
a
man
of
mount
ephraim
whose
name
was
micah
17
2
and
he
said
unto
his
mother
the
eleven
hundred
shekels
of
silver
that
were
taken
from
thee
about
which
thou
cursedst
and
spakest
of
also
in
mine
ears
behold
the
silver
is
with
me
i
took
it
and
his
mother
said
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
my
son
17
3
and
when
he
had
restored
the
eleven
hundred
shekels
of
silver
to
his
mother
his
mother
said
i
had
wholly
dedicated
the
silver
unto
the
lord
from
my
hand
for
my
son
to
make
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
now
therefore
i
will
restore
it
unto
thee
17
4
yet
he
restored
the
money
unto
his
mother
and
his
mother
took
two
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
gave
them
to
the
founder
who
made
thereof
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
and
they
were
in
the
house
of
micah
17
5
and
the
man
micah
had
an
house
of
gods
and
made
an
ephod
and
teraphim
and
consecrated
one
of
his
sons
who
became
his
priest
17
6
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
but
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
17
7
and
there
was
a
young
man
out
of
bethlehemjudah
of
the
family
of
judah
who
was
a
levite
and
he
sojourned
there
17
8
and
the
man
departed
out
of
the
city
from
bethlehemjudah
to
sojourn
where
he
could
find
a
place
and
he
came
to
mount
ephraim
to
the
house
of
micah
as
he
journeyed
17
9
and
micah
said
unto
him
whence
comest
thou
and
he
said
unto
him
i
am
a
levite
of
bethlehemjudah
and
i
go
to
sojourn
where
i
may
find
a
place
17
10
and
micah
said
unto
him
dwell
with
me
and
be
unto
me
a
father
and
a
priest
and
i
will
give
thee
ten
shekels
of
silver
by
the
year
and
a
suit
of
apparel
and
thy
victuals
so
the
levite
went
in
17
11
and
the
levite
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
man
and
the
young
man
was
unto
him
as
one
of
his
sons
17
12
and
micah
consecrated
the
levite
and
the
young
man
became
his
priest
and
was
in
the
house
of
micah
17
13
then
said
micah
now
know
i
that
the
lord
will
do
me
good
seeing
i
have
a
levite
to
my
priest
18
1
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
and
in
those
days
the
tribe
of
the
danites
sought
them
an
inheritance
to
dwell
in
for
unto
that
day
all
their
inheritance
had
not
fallen
unto
them
among
the
tribes
of
israel
18
2
and
the
children
of
dan
sent
of
their
family
five
men
from
their
coasts
men
of
valour
from
zorah
and
from
eshtaol
to
spy
out
the
land
and
to
search
it
and
they
said
unto
them
go
search
the
land
who
when
they
came
to
mount
ephraim
to
the
house
of
micah
they
lodged
there
18
3
when
they
were
by
the
house
of
micah
they
knew
the
voice
of
the
young
man
the
levite
and
they
turned
in
thither
and
said
unto
him
who
brought
thee
hither
and
what
makest
thou
in
this
place
and
what
hast
thou
here
18
4
and
he
said
unto
them
thus
and
thus
dealeth
micah
with
me
and
hath
hired
me
and
i
am
his
priest
18
5
and
they
said
unto
him
ask
counsel
we
pray
thee
of
god
that
we
may
know
whether
our
way
which
we
go
shall
be
prosperous
18
6
and
the
priest
said
unto
them
go
in
peace
before
the
lord
is
your
way
wherein
ye
go
18
7
then
the
five
men
departed
and
came
to
laish
and
saw
the
people
that
were
therein
how
they
dwelt
careless
after
the
manner
of
the
zidonians
quiet
and
secure
and
there
was
no
magistrate
in
the
land
that
might
put
them
to
shame
in
any
thing
and
they
were
far
from
the
zidonians
and
had
no
business
with
any
man
18
8
and
they
came
unto
their
brethren
to
zorah
and
eshtaol
and
their
brethren
said
unto
them
what
say
ye
18
9
and
they
said
arise
that
we
may
go
up
against
them
for
we
have
seen
the
land
and
behold
it
is
very
good
and
are
ye
still
be
not
slothful
to
go
and
to
enter
to
possess
the
land
18
10
when
ye
go
ye
shall
come
unto
a
people
secure
and
to
a
large
land
for
god
hath
given
it
into
your
hands
a
place
where
there
is
no
want
of
any
thing
that
is
in
the
earth
18
11
and
there
went
from
thence
of
the
family
of
the
danites
out
of
zorah
and
out
of
eshtaol
six
hundred
men
appointed
with
weapons
of
war
18
12
and
they
went
up
and
pitched
in
kirjathjearim
in
judah
wherefore
they
called
that
place
mahanehdan
unto
this
day
behold
it
is
behind
kirjathjearim
18
13
and
they
passed
thence
unto
mount
ephraim
and
came
unto
the
house
of
micah
18
14
then
answered
the
five
men
that
went
to
spy
out
the
country
of
laish
and
said
unto
their
brethren
do
ye
know
that
there
is
in
these
houses
an
ephod
and
teraphim
and
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
now
therefore
consider
what
ye
have
to
do
18
15
and
they
turned
thitherward
and
came
to
the
house
of
the
young
man
the
levite
even
unto
the
house
of
micah
and
saluted
him
18
16
and
the
six
hundred
men
appointed
with
their
weapons
of
war
which
were
of
the
children
of
dan
stood
by
the
entering
of
the
gate
18
17
and
the
five
men
that
went
to
spy
out
the
land
went
up
and
came
in
thither
and
took
the
graven
image
and
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
molten
image
and
the
priest
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
appointed
with
weapons
of
war
18
18
and
these
went
into
micah’s
house
and
fetched
the
carved
image
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
molten
image
then
said
the
priest
unto
them
what
do
ye
18
19
and
they
said
unto
him
hold
thy
peace
lay
thine
hand
upon
thy
mouth
and
go
with
us
and
be
to
us
a
father
and
a
priest
is
it
better
for
thee
to
be
a
priest
unto
the
house
of
one
man
or
that
thou
be
a
priest
unto
a
tribe
and
a
family
in
israel
18
20
and
the
priest’s
heart
was
glad
and
he
took
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
graven
image
and
went
in
the
midst
of
the
people
18
21
so
they
turned
and
departed
and
put
the
little
ones
and
the
cattle
and
the
carriage
before
them
18
22
and
when
they
were
a
good
way
from
the
house
of
micah
the
men
that
were
in
the
houses
near
to
micah’s
house
were
gathered
together
and
overtook
the
children
of
dan
18
23
and
they
cried
unto
the
children
of
dan
and
they
turned
their
faces
and
said
unto
micah
what
aileth
thee
that
thou
comest
with
such
a
company
18
24
and
he
said
ye
have
taken
away
my
gods
which
i
made
and
the
priest
and
ye
are
gone
away
and
what
have
i
more
and
what
is
this
that
ye
say
unto
me
what
aileth
thee
18
25
and
the
children
of
dan
said
unto
him
let
not
thy
voice
be
heard
among
us
lest
angry
fellows
run
upon
thee
and
thou
lose
thy
life
with
the
lives
of
thy
household
18
26
and
the
children
of
dan
went
their
way
and
when
micah
saw
that
they
were
too
strong
for
him
he
turned
and
went
back
unto
his
house
18
27
and
they
took
the
things
which
micah
had
made
and
the
priest
which
he
had
and
came
unto
laish
unto
a
people
that
were
at
quiet
and
secure
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
burnt
the
city
with
fire
18
28
and
there
was
no
deliverer
because
it
was
far
from
zidon
and
they
had
no
business
with
any
man
and
it
was
in
the
valley
that
lieth
by
bethrehob
and
they
built
a
city
and
dwelt
therein
18
29
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
dan
after
the
name
of
dan
their
father
who
was
born
unto
israel
howbeit
the
name
of
the
city
was
laish
at
the
first
18
30
and
the
children
of
dan
set
up
the
graven
image
and
jonathan
the
son
of
gershom
the
son
of
manasseh
he
and
his
sons
were
priests
to
the
tribe
of
dan
until
the
day
of
the
captivity
of
the
land
18
31
and
they
set
them
up
micah’s
graven
image
which
he
made
all
the
time
that
the
house
of
god
was
in
shiloh
19
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
when
there
was
no
king
in
israel
that
there
was
a
certain
levite
sojourning
on
the
side
of
mount
ephraim
who
took
to
him
a
concubine
out
of
bethlehemjudah
19
2
and
his
concubine
played
the
whore
against
him
and
went
away
from
him
unto
her
father’s
house
to
bethlehemjudah
and
was
there
four
whole
months
19
3
and
her
husband
arose
and
went
after
her
to
speak
friendly
unto
her
and
to
bring
her
again
having
his
servant
with
him
and
a
couple
of
asses
and
she
brought
him
into
her
father’s
house
and
when
the
father
of
the
damsel
saw
him
he
rejoiced
to
meet
him
19
4
and
his
father
in
law
the
damsel’s
father
retained
him
and
he
abode
with
him
three
days
so
they
did
eat
and
drink
and
lodged
there
19
5
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
fourth
day
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
that
he
rose
up
to
depart
and
the
damsel’s
father
said
unto
his
son
in
law
comfort
thine
heart
with
a
morsel
of
bread
and
afterward
go
your
way
19
6
and
they
sat
down
and
did
eat
and
drink
both
of
them
together
for
the
damsel’s
father
had
said
unto
the
man
be
content
i
pray
thee
and
tarry
all
night
and
let
thine
heart
be
merry
19
7
and
when
the
man
rose
up
to
depart
his
father
in
law
urged
him
therefore
he
lodged
there
again
19
8
and
he
arose
early
in
the
morning
on
the
fifth
day
to
depart
and
the
damsel’s
father
said
comfort
thine
heart
i
pray
thee
and
they
tarried
until
afternoon
and
they
did
eat
both
of
them
19
9
and
when
the
man
rose
up
to
depart
he
and
his
concubine
and
his
servant
his
father
in
law
the
damsel’s
father
said
unto
him
behold
now
the
day
draweth
toward
evening
i
pray
you
tarry
all
night
behold
the
day
groweth
to
an
end
lodge
here
that
thine
heart
may
be
merry
and
to
morrow
get
you
early
on
your
way
that
thou
mayest
go
home
19
10
but
the
man
would
not
tarry
that
night
but
he
rose
up
and
departed
and
came
over
against
jebus
which
is
jerusalem
and
there
were
with
him
two
asses
saddled
his
concubine
also
was
with
him
19
11
and
when
they
were
by
jebus
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
come
i
pray
thee
and
let
us
turn
in
into
this
city
of
the
jebusites
and
lodge
in
it
19
12
and
his
master
said
unto
him
we
will
not
turn
aside
hither
into
the
city
of
a
stranger
that
is
not
of
the
children
of
israel
we
will
pass
over
to
gibeah
19
13
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
come
and
let
us
draw
near
to
one
of
these
places
to
lodge
all
night
in
gibeah
or
in
ramah
19
14
and
they
passed
on
and
went
their
way
and
the
sun
went
down
upon
them
when
they
were
by
gibeah
which
belongeth
to
benjamin
19
15
and
they
turned
aside
thither
to
go
in
and
to
lodge
in
gibeah
and
when
he
went
in
he
sat
him
down
in
a
street
of
the
city
for
there
was
no
man
that
took
them
into
his
house
to
lodging
19
16
and
behold
there
came
an
old
man
from
his
work
out
of
the
field
at
even
which
was
also
of
mount
ephraim
and
he
sojourned
in
gibeah
but
the
men
of
the
place
were
benjamites
19
17
and
when
he
had
lifted
up
his
eyes
he
saw
a
wayfaring
man
in
the
street
of
the
city
and
the
old
man
said
whither
goest
thou
and
whence
comest
thou
19
18
and
he
said
unto
him
we
are
passing
from
bethlehemjudah
toward
the
side
of
mount
ephraim
from
thence
am
i
and
i
went
to
bethlehemjudah
but
i
am
now
going
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
there
is
no
man
that
receiveth
me
to
house
19
19
yet
there
is
both
straw
and
provender
for
our
asses
and
there
is
bread
and
wine
also
for
me
and
for
thy
handmaid
and
for
the
young
man
which
is
with
thy
servants
there
is
no
want
of
any
thing
19
20
and
the
old
man
said
peace
be
with
thee
howsoever
let
all
thy
wants
lie
upon
me
only
lodge
not
in
the
street
19
21
so
he
brought
him
into
his
house
and
gave
provender
unto
the
asses
and
they
washed
their
feet
and
did
eat
and
drink
19
22
now
as
they
were
making
their
hearts
merry
behold
the
men
of
the
city
certain
sons
of
belial
beset
the
house
round
about
and
beat
at
the
door
and
spake
to
the
master
of
the
house
the
old
man
saying
bring
forth
the
man
that
came
into
thine
house
that
we
may
know
him
19
23
and
the
man
the
master
of
the
house
went
out
unto
them
and
said
unto
them
nay
my
brethren
nay
i
pray
you
do
not
so
wickedly
seeing
that
this
man
is
come
into
mine
house
do
not
this
folly
19
24
behold
here
is
my
daughter
a
maiden
and
his
concubine
them
i
will
bring
out
now
and
humble
ye
them
and
do
with
them
what
seemeth
good
unto
you
but
unto
this
man
do
not
so
vile
a
thing
19
25
but
the
men
would
not
hearken
to
him
so
the
man
took
his
concubine
and
brought
her
forth
unto
them
and
they
knew
her
and
abused
her
all
the
night
until
the
morning
and
when
the
day
began
to
spring
they
let
her
go
19
26
then
came
the
woman
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
and
fell
down
at
the
door
of
the
man’s
house
where
her
lord
was
till
it
was
light
19
27
and
her
lord
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
and
went
out
to
go
his
way
and
behold
the
woman
his
concubine
was
fallen
down
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
her
hands
were
upon
the
threshold
19
28
and
he
said
unto
her
up
and
let
us
be
going
but
none
answered
then
the
man
took
her
up
upon
an
ass
and
the
man
rose
up
and
gat
him
unto
his
place
19
29
and
when
he
was
come
into
his
house
he
took
a
knife
and
laid
hold
on
his
concubine
and
divided
her
together
with
her
bones
into
twelve
pieces
and
sent
her
into
all
the
coasts
of
israel
19
30
and
it
was
so
that
all
that
saw
it
said
there
was
no
such
deed
done
nor
seen
from
the
day
that
the
children
of
israel
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
unto
this
day
consider
of
it
take
advice
and
speak
your
minds
20
1
then
all
the
children
of
israel
went
out
and
the
congregation
was
gathered
together
as
one
man
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
with
the
land
of
gilead
unto
the
lord
in
mizpeh
20
2
and
the
chief
of
all
the
people
even
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
presented
themselves
in
the
assembly
of
the
people
of
god
four
hundred
thousand
footmen
that
drew
sword
20
3
(now
the
children
of
benjamin
heard
that
the
children
of
israel
were
gone
up
to
mizpeh
)
then
said
the
children
of
israel
tell
us
how
was
this
wickedness
20
4
and
the
levite
the
husband
of
the
woman
that
was
slain
answered
and
said
i
came
into
gibeah
that
belongeth
to
benjamin
i
and
my
concubine
to
lodge
20
5
and
the
men
of
gibeah
rose
against
me
and
beset
the
house
round
about
upon
me
by
night
and
thought
to
have
slain
me
and
my
concubine
have
they
forced
that
she
is
dead
20
6
and
i
took
my
concubine
and
cut
her
in
pieces
and
sent
her
throughout
all
the
country
of
the
inheritance
of
israel
for
they
have
committed
lewdness
and
folly
in
israel
20
7
behold
ye
are
all
children
of
israel
give
here
your
advice
and
counsel
20
8
and
all
the
people
arose
as
one
man
saying
we
will
not
any
of
us
go
to
his
tent
neither
will
we
any
of
us
turn
into
his
house
20
9
but
now
this
shall
be
the
thing
which
we
will
do
to
gibeah
we
will
go
up
by
lot
against
it
20
10
and
we
will
take
ten
men
of
an
hundred
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
and
an
hundred
of
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
out
of
ten
thousand
to
fetch
victual
for
the
people
that
they
may
do
when
they
come
to
gibeah
of
benjamin
according
to
all
the
folly
that
they
have
wrought
in
israel
20
11
so
all
the
men
of
israel
were
gathered
against
the
city
knit
together
as
one
man
20
12
and
the
tribes
of
israel
sent
men
through
all
the
tribe
of
benjamin
saying
what
wickedness
is
this
that
is
done
among
you
20
13
now
therefore
deliver
us
the
men
the
children
of
belial
which
are
in
gibeah
that
we
may
put
them
to
death
and
put
away
evil
from
israel
but
the
children
of
benjamin
would
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
their
brethren
the
children
of
israel
20
14
but
the
children
of
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
the
cities
unto
gibeah
to
go
out
to
battle
against
the
children
of
israel
20
15
and
the
children
of
benjamin
were
numbered
at
that
time
out
of
the
cities
twenty
and
six
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
beside
the
inhabitants
of
gibeah
which
were
numbered
seven
hundred
chosen
men
20
16
among
all
this
people
there
were
seven
hundred
chosen
men
lefthanded
every
one
could
sling
stones
at
an
hair
breadth
and
not
miss
20
17
and
the
men
of
israel
beside
benjamin
were
numbered
four
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
all
these
were
men
of
war
20
18
and
the
children
of
israel
arose
and
went
up
to
the
house
of
god
and
asked
counsel
of
god
and
said
which
of
us
shall
go
up
first
to
the
battle
against
the
children
of
benjamin
and
the
lord
said
judah
shall
go
up

20
19
and
the
children
of
israel
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
encamped
against
gibeah
20
20
and
the
men
of

and
the
men
of
israel
put
themselves
in
array
to
fight
against
them
at

20
21
and
the
children
of

came
forth
out
of
gibeah
and
destroyed
down
to
the
ground
of
the
israelites
that
day
twenty
and
two
thousand
men
20
22
and
the
people
the
men
of
israel
encouraged
themselves
and
set
their
battle
again
in
array
in
the
place
where
they
put
themselves
in
array
the
first
day
20
23
(and
the
children
of
israel
went
up
and
wept
before
the
lord
until
even
and
asked
counsel
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
up
again
to
battle
against
the
children
of
benjamin
my
brother
and
the
lord
said
go
up
against
him
)
20
24
and
the
children
of
israel
came
near
against
the
children
of
benjamin
the
second
day
20
25
and
benjamin
went

to
the
ground
of
the
children
of
israel
again
eighteen
thousand
men
all
these
drew
the
sword
20
26
then
all
the
children
of
israel
and
all
the
people
went
up
and
came
unto
the
house
of
god
and
wept
and
sat
there
before
the
lord
and
fasted
that
day
until
even
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
20
27
and
the
children
of
israel
enquired
of
the
lord
(for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
was
there
in
those
days
20
28
and
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
stood
before
it
in
those
days
)
saying
shall
i
yet
again
go
out
to
battle
against
the
children
of
benjamin
my
brother
or
shall
i
cease
and
the
lord
said
go
up
for
to
morrow
i
will
deliver
them
into
thine
hand
20
29
and
israel
set
liers
in
wait
round
about
gibeah
20
30
and
the
children
of
israel
went
up
against
the
children
of
benjamin
on
the
third
day
and
put
themselves
in
array
against
gibeah
as
at
other
times
20
31
and
the
children
of
benjamin
went
out
against
the
people
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
and
they
began
to
smite
of
the
people
and
kill
as
at
other
times
in
the
highways
of
which
one
goeth
up
to
the
house
of
god
and
the
other
to
gibeah
in
the
field
about
thirty
men
of
israel
20
32
and
the
children
of
benjamin
said
they
are
smitten
down
before
us
as
at
the
first
but
the
children
of
israel
said
let
us
flee
and
draw
them
from
the
city
unto
the
highways
20
33
and
all
the
men
of
israel
rose
up
out
of
their
place
and
put
themselves
in
array
at
baaltamar
and
the
liers
in
wait
of
israel
came
forth
out
of
their
places
even
out
of
the
meadows
of
gibeah
20
34
and
there
came
against
gibeah
ten
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
israel
and
the
battle
was
sore
but
they
knew
not
that
evil
was
near
them
20
35
and
the
lord
smote
benjamin
before
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
destroyed
of
the
benjamites
that
day
twenty
and
five
thousand
and
an
hundred
men
all
these
drew
the
sword
20
36
so
the
children
of
benjamin
saw
that
they
were
smitten
for
the
men
of
israel
gave
place
to
the
benjamites
because
they
trusted
unto
the
liers
in
wait
which
they
had
set
beside
gibeah
20
37
and
the
liers
in
wait
hasted
and
rushed
upon
gibeah
and
the
liers
in
wait
drew
themselves
along
and
smote
all
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
20
38
now
there
was
an
appointed
sign
between
the
men
of
israel
and
the
liers
in
wait
that
they
should
make
a
great
flame
with
smoke
rise
up
out
of
the
city
20
39
and
when
the
men
of
israel
retired
in
the
battle
benjamin
began
to
smite
and
kill
of
the
men
of
israel
about
thirty
persons
for
they
said
surely
they
are
smitten
down
before
us
as
in
the
first
battle
20
40
but
when
the
flame
began
to
arise
up
out
of
the
city
with
a
pillar
of
smoke
the
benjamites
looked
behind
them
and
behold
the
flame
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven
20
41
and
when
the
men
of
israel
turned
again
the
men
of
benjamin
were
amazed
for
they
saw
that
evil
was
come
upon
them
20
42
therefore
they
turned
their
backs
before
the
men
of
israel
unto
the
way
of
the
wilderness
but
the
battle
overtook
them
and
them
which
came
out
of
the
cities
they
destroyed
in
the
midst
of
them
20
43
thus
they
inclosed
the
benjamites
round
about
and
chased
them
and
trode
them
down
with
ease
over
against
gibeah
toward
the
sunrising
20
44
and
there
fell
of
benjamin
eighteen
thousand
men
all
these
were
men
of
valour
20
45
and
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
of
rimmon
and
they
gleaned
of
them
in
the
highways
five
thousand
men
and
pursued
hard
after
them
unto
gidom
and
slew
two
thousand
men
of
them
20
46
so
that
all
which
fell
that
day
of
benjamin
were
twenty
and
five
thousand
men
that
drew
the
sword
all
these
were
men
of
valour
20
47
but
six
hundred
men
turned
and
fled
to
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
rimmon
and
abode
in
the
rock
rimmon
four
months
20
48
and
the
men
of
israel
turned
again
upon
the
children
of
benjamin
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
as
well
the
men
of
every
city
as
the
beast
and
all
that
came
to
hand
also
they
set
on
fire
all
the
cities
that
they
came
to
21
1
now
the
men
of
israel
had
sworn
in
mizpeh
saying
there
shall
not
any
of
us
give
his
daughter
unto
benjamin
to
wife
21
2
and
the
people
came
to
the
house
of
god
and
abode
there
till
even
before
god
and
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
sore
21
3
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
why
is
this
come
to
pass
in
israel
that
there
should
be
to
day
one
tribe
lacking
in
israel
21
4
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
people
rose
early
and
built
there
an
altar
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
21
5
and
the
children
of
israel
said
who
is
there
among
all
the
tribes
of
israel
that
came
not
up
with
the
congregation
unto
the
lord
for
they
had
made
a
great
oath
concerning
him
that
came
not
up
to
the
lord
to
mizpeh
saying
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
21
6
and
the
children
of
israel
repented
them
for
benjamin
their
brother
and
said
there
is
one
tribe
cut
off
from
israel
this
day
21
7
how
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain
seeing
we
have
sworn
by
the
lord
that
we
will
not
give
them
of
our
daughters
to
wives
21
8
and
they
said
what
one
is
there
of
the
tribes
of
israel
that
came
not
up
to
mizpeh
to
the
lord
and
behold
there
came
none
to
the
camp
from
jabeshgilead
to
the
assembly
21
9
for
the
people
were
numbered
and
behold
there
were
none
of
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
there
21
10
and
the
congregation
sent
thither
twelve
thousand
men
of
the
valiantest
and
commanded
them
saying
go
and
smite
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
with
the
women
and
the
children
21
11
and
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
ye
shall
utterly
destroy
every
male
and
every
woman
that
hath
lain
by
man
21
12
and
they
found
among
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
four
hundred
young
virgins
that
had
known
no
man
by
lying
with
any
male
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
camp
to
shiloh
which
is
in
the
land
of
canaan
21
13
and
the
whole
congregation
sent
some
to
speak
to
the
children
of
benjamin
that
were
in
the
rock
rimmon
and
to
call
peaceably
unto
them
21
14
and
benjamin
came
again
at
that
time
and
they
gave
them
wives
which
they
had
saved
alive
of
the
women
of
jabeshgilead
and
yet
so
they
sufficed
them
not
21
15
and
the
people
repented
them
for
benjamin
because
that
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
in
the
tribes
of
israel
21
16
then
the
elders
of
the
congregation
said
how
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain
seeing
the
women
are
destroyed
out
of
benjamin
21
17
and
they
said
there
must
be
an
inheritance
for
them
that
be
escaped
of
benjamin
that
a
tribe
be
not
destroyed
out
of
israel
21
18
howbeit
we
may
not
give
them
wives
of
our
daughters
for
the
children
of
israel
have
sworn
saying
cursed
be
he
that
giveth
a
wife
to
benjamin
21
19
then
they
said
behold
there
is
a
feast
of
the
lord
in
shiloh
yearly
in
a
place
which
is
on
the
north
side
of
bethel
on
the
east
side
of
the
highway
that
goeth
up
from
bethel
to
shechem
and
on
the
south
of
lebonah
21
20
therefore
they
commanded
the
children
of
benjamin
saying
go
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
vineyards
21
21
and
see
and
behold
if
the
daughters
of
shiloh
come
out
to
dance
in
dances
then
come
ye
out
of
the
vineyards
and
catch
you
every
man
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
shiloh
and
go
to
the
land
of
benjamin
21
22
and
it
shall
be
when
their
fathers
or
their
brethren
come
unto
us
to
complain
that
we
will
say
unto
them
be
favourable
unto
them
for
our
sakes
because
we
reserved
not
to
each
man
his
wife
in
the
war
for
ye
did
not
give
unto
them
at
this
time
that
ye
should
be
guilty
21
23
and
the
children
of
benjamin
did
so
and
took
them
wives
according
to
their
number
of
them
that
danced
whom
they
caught
and
they
went
and
returned
unto
their
inheritance
and
repaired
the
cities
and
dwelt
in
them
21
24
and
the
children
of
israel
departed
thence
at
that
time
every
man
to
his
tribe
and
to
his
family
and
they
went
out
from
thence
every
man
to
his
inheritance
21
25
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
the
book
of
ruth
1
1
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
when
the
judges
ruled
that
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land
and
a
certain
man
of
bethlehemjudah
went
to
sojourn
in
the
country
of
moab
he
and
his
wife
and
his
two
sons
1
2
and
the
name
of
the
man
was
elimelech
and
the
name
of
his
wife
naomi
and
the
name
of
his
two
sons
mahlon
and
chilion
ephrathites
of
bethlehemjudah
and
they
came
into
the
country
of
moab
and
continued
there
1
3
and
elimelech
naomi’s
husband
died
and
she
was
left
and
her
two
sons
1
4
and
they
took
them
wives
of
the
women
of
moab
the
name
of
the
one
was
orpah
and
the
name
of
the
other
ruth
and
they
dwelled
there
about
ten
years
1
5
and
mahlon
and
chilion
died
also
both
of
them
and
the
woman
was
left
of
her
two
sons
and
her
husband
1
6
then
she
arose
with
her
daughters
in
law
that
she
might
return
from
the
country
of
moab
for
she
had
heard
in
the
country
of
moab
how
that
the
lord
had
visited
his
people
in
giving
them
bread
1
7
wherefore
she
went
forth
out
of
the
place
where
she
was
and
her
two
daughters
in
law
with
her
and
they
went
on
the
way
to
return
unto
the
land
of
judah
1
8
and
naomi
said
unto
her
two
daughters
in
law
go
return
each
to
her
mother’s
house
the
lord
deal
kindly
with
you
as
ye
have
dealt
with
the
dead
and
with
me
1
9
the
lord
grant
you
that
ye
may
find
rest
each
of
you
in
the
house
of
her
husband
then
she
kissed
them
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
1
10
and
they
said
unto
her
surely
we
will
return
with
thee
unto
thy
people
1
11
and
naomi
said
turn
again
my
daughters
why
will
ye
go
with
me
are
there
yet
any
more
sons
in
my
womb
that
they
may
be
your
husbands
1
12
turn
again
my
daughters
go
your
way
for
i
am
too
old
to
have
an
husband
if
i
should
say
i
have
hope
if
i
should
have
an
husband
also
to
night
and
should
also
bear
sons
1
13
would
ye
tarry
for
them
till
they
were
grown
would
ye
stay
for
them
from
having
husbands
nay
my
daughters
for
it
grieveth
me
much
for
your
sakes
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
gone
out
against
me
1
14
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
again
and
orpah
kissed
her
mother
in
law
but
ruth
clave
unto
her
1
15
and
she
said
behold
thy
sister
in
law
is
gone
back
unto
her
people
and
unto
her
gods
return
thou
after
thy
sister
in
law
1
16
and
ruth
said
intreat
me
not
to
leave
thee
or
to
return
from
following
after
thee
for
whither
thou
goest
i
will
go
and
where
thou
lodgest
i
will
lodge
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
1
17
where
thou
diest
will
i
die
and
there
will
i
be
buried
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
ought
but
death
part
thee
and
me
1
18
when
she
saw
that
she
was
stedfastly
minded
to
go
with
her
then
she
left
speaking
unto
her
1
19
so
they
two
went
until
they
came
to
bethlehem
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
to
bethlehem
that
all
the
city
was
moved
about
them
and
they
said
is
this
naomi
1
20
and
she
said
unto
them
call
me
not
naomi
call
me
mara
for
the
almighty
hath
dealt
very
bitterly
with
me
1
21
i
went
out
full
and
the
lord
hath
brought
me
home
again
empty
why
then
call
ye
me
naomi
seeing
the
lord
hath
testified
against
me
and
the
almighty
hath
afflicted
me
1
22
so
naomi
returned
and
ruth
the
moabitess
her
daughter
in
law
with
her
which
returned
out
of
the
country
of
moab
and
they
came
to
bethlehem
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest
2
1
and
naomi
had
a
kinsman
of
her
husband’s
a
mighty
man
of
wealth
of
the
family
of
elimelech
and
his
name
was
boaz
2
2
and
ruth
the
moabitess
said
unto
naomi
let
me
now
go
to
the
field
and
glean
ears
of
corn
after
him
in
whose
sight
i
shall
find
grace
and
she
said
unto
her
go
my
daughter
2
3
and
she
went
and
came
and
gleaned
in
the
field
after
the
reapers
and
her
hap
was
to
light
on
a
part
of
the
field
belonging
unto
boaz
who
was
of
the
kindred
of
elimelech
2
4
and
behold
boaz
came
from
bethlehem
and
said
unto
the
reapers
the
lord
be
with
you
and
they
answered
him
the
lord
bless
thee
2
5
then
said
boaz
unto
his
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers
whose
damsel
is
this
2
6
and
the
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers
answered
and
said
it
is
the
moabitish
damsel
that
came
back
with
naomi
out
of
the
country
of
moab
2
7
and
she
said
i
pray
you
let
me
glean
and
gather
after
the
reapers
among
the
sheaves
so
she
came
and
hath
continued
even
from
the
morning
until
now
that
she
tarried
a
little
in
the
house
2
8
then
said
boaz
unto
ruth
hearest
thou
not
my
daughter
go
not
to
glean
in
another
field
neither
go
from
hence
but
abide
here
fast
by
my
maidens
2
9
let
thine
eyes
be
on
the
field
that
they
do
reap
and
go
thou
after
them
have
i
not
charged
the
young
men
that
they
shall
not
touch
thee
and
when
thou
art
athirst
go
unto
the
vessels
and
drink
of
that
which
the
young
men
have
drawn
2
10
then
she
fell
on
her
face
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
and
said
unto
him
why
have
i
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
that
thou
shouldest
take
knowledge
of
me
seeing
i
am
a
stranger
2
11
and
boaz
answered
and
said
unto
her
it
hath
fully
been
shewed
me
all
that
thou
hast
done
unto
thy
mother
in
law
since
the
death
of
thine
husband
and
how
thou
hast
left
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
the
land
of
thy
nativity
and
art
come
unto
a
people
which
thou
knewest
not
heretofore
2
12
the
lord
recompense
thy
work
and
a
full
reward
be
given
thee
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
under
whose
wings
thou
art
come
to
trust
2
13
then
she
said
let
me
find
favour
in
thy
sight
my
lord
for
that
thou
hast
comforted
me
and
for
that
thou
hast
spoken
friendly
unto
thine
handmaid
though
i
be
not
like
unto
one
of
thine
handmaidens
2
14
and
boaz
said
unto
her
at
mealtime
come
thou
hither
and
eat
of
the
bread
and
dip
thy
morsel
in
the
vinegar
and
she
sat
beside
the
reapers
and
he
reached
her
parched
corn
and
she
did
eat
and
was
sufficed
and
left
2
15
and
when
she
was
risen
up
to
glean
boaz
commanded
his
young
men
saying
let
her
glean
even
among
the
sheaves
and
reproach
her
not
2
16
and
let
fall
also
some
of
the
handfuls
of
purpose
for
her
and
leave
them
that
she
may
glean
them
and
rebuke
her
not
2
17
so
she
gleaned
in
the
field
until
even
and
beat
out
that
she
had
gleaned
and
it
was
about
an
ephah
of
barley
2
18
and
she
took
it
up
and
went
into
the
city
and
her
mother
in
law
saw
what
she
had
gleaned
and
she
brought
forth
and
gave
to
her
that
she
had
reserved
after
she
was
sufficed
2
19
and
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her
where
hast
thou
gleaned
to
day
and
where
wroughtest
thou
blessed
be
he
that
did
take
knowledge
of
thee
and
she
shewed
her
mother
in
law
with
whom
she
had
wrought
and
said
the
man’s
name
with
whom
i
wrought
to
day
is
boaz
2
20
and
naomi
said
unto
her
daughter
in
law
blessed
be
he
of
the
lord
who
hath
not
left
off
his
kindness
to
the
living
and
to
the
dead
and
naomi
said
unto
her
the
man
is
near
of
kin
unto
us
one
of
our
next
kinsmen
2
21
and
ruth
the
moabitess
said
he
said
unto
me
also
thou
shalt
keep
fast
by
my
young
men
until
they
have
ended
all
my
harvest
2
22
and
naomi
said
unto
ruth
her
daughter
in
law
it
is
good
my
daughter
that
thou
go
out
with
his
maidens
that
they
meet
thee
not
in
any
other
field
2
23
so
she
kept
fast
by
the
maidens
of
boaz
to
glean
unto
the
end
of
barley
harvest
and
of
wheat
harvest
and
dwelt
with
her
mother
in
law
3
1
then
naomi
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her
my
daughter
shall
i
not
seek
rest
for
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
3
2
and
now
is
not
boaz
of
our
kindred
with
whose
maidens
thou
wast
behold
he
winnoweth
barley
to
night
in
the
threshingfloor
3
3
wash
thyself
therefore
and
anoint
thee
and
put
thy
raiment
upon
thee
and
get
thee
down
to
the
floor
but
make
not
thyself
known
unto
the
man
until
he
shall
have
done
eating
and
drinking
3
4
and
it
shall
be
when
he
lieth
down
that
thou
shalt
mark
the
place
where
he
shall
lie
and
thou
shalt
go
in
and
uncover
his
feet
and
lay
thee
down
and
he
will
tell
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
3
5
and
she
said
unto
her
all
that
thou
sayest
unto
me
i
will
do
3
6
and
she
went
down
unto
the
floor
and
did
according
to
all
that
her
mother
in
law
bade
her
3
7
and
when
boaz
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
his
heart
was
merry
he
went
to
lie
down
at
the
end
of
the
heap
of
corn
and
she
came
softly
and
uncovered
his
feet
and
laid
her
down
3
8
and
it
came
to
pass
at
midnight
that
the
man
was
afraid
and
turned
himself
and
behold
a
woman
lay
at
his
feet
3
9
and
he
said
who
art
thou
and
she
answered
i
am
ruth
thine
handmaid
spread
therefore
thy
skirt
over
thine
handmaid
for
thou
art
a
near
kinsman
3
10
and
he
said
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
my
daughter
for
thou
hast
shewed
more
kindness
in
the
latter
end
than
at
the
beginning
inasmuch
as
thou
followedst
not
young
men
whether
poor
or
rich
3
11
and
now
my
daughter
fear
not
i
will
do
to
thee
all
that
thou
requirest
for
all
the
city
of
my
people
doth
know
that
thou
art
a
virtuous
woman
3
12
and
now
it
is
true
that
i
am
thy
near
kinsman
howbeit
there
is
a
kinsman
nearer
than
i
3
13
tarry
this
night
and
it
shall
be
in
the
morning
that
if
he
will
perform
unto
thee
the
part
of
a
kinsman
well
let
him
do
the
kinsman’s
part
but
if
he
will
not
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee
then
will
i
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee
as
the
lord
liveth
lie
down
until
the
morning
3
14
and
she
lay
at
his
feet
until
the
morning
and
she
rose
up
before
one
could
know
another
and
he
said
let
it
not
be
known
that
a
woman
came
into
the
floor
3
15
also
he
said
bring
the
vail
that
thou
hast
upon
thee
and
hold
it
and
when
she
held
it
he
measured
six
measures
of
barley
and
laid
it
on
her
and
she
went
into
the
city
3
16
and
when
she
came
to
her
mother
in
law
she
said
who
art
thou
my
daughter
and
she
told
her
all
that
the
man
had
done
to
her
3
17
and
she
said
these
six
measures
of
barley
gave
he
me
for
he
said
to
me
go
not
empty
unto
thy
mother
in
law
3
18
then
said
she
sit
still
my
daughter
until
thou
know
how
the
matter
will
fall
for
the
man
will
not
be
in
rest
until
he
have
finished
the
thing
this
day
4
1
then
went
boaz
up
to
the
gate
and
sat
him
down
there
and
behold
the
kinsman
of
whom
boaz
spake
came
by
unto
whom
he
said
ho
such
a
one
turn
aside
sit
down
here
and
he
turned
aside
and
sat
down
4
2
and
he
took
ten
men
of
the
elders
of
the
city
and
said
sit
ye
down
here
and
they
sat
down
4
3
and
he
said
unto
the
kinsman
naomi
that
is
come
again
out
of
the
country
of
moab
selleth
a
parcel
of
land
which
was
our
brother
elimelech’s
4
4
and
i
thought
to
advertise
thee
saying
buy
it
before
the
inhabitants
and
before
the
elders
of
my
people
if
thou
wilt
redeem
it
redeem
it
but
if
thou
wilt
not
redeem
it
then
tell
me
that
i
may
know
for
there
is
none
to
redeem
it
beside
thee
and
i
am
after
thee
and
he
said
i
will
redeem
it
4
5
then
said
boaz
what
day
thou
buyest
the
field
of
the
hand
of
naomi
thou
must
buy
it
also
of
ruth
the
moabitess
the
wife
of
the
dead
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance
4
6
and
the
kinsman
said
i
cannot
redeem
it
for
myself
lest
i
mar
mine
own
inheritance
redeem
thou
my
right
to
thyself
for
i
cannot
redeem
it
4
7
now
this
was
the
manner
in
former
time
in
israel
concerning
redeeming
and
concerning
changing
for
to
confirm
all
things
a
man
plucked
off
his
shoe
and
gave
it
to
his
neighbour
and
this
was
a
testimony
in
israel
4
8
therefore
the
kinsman
said
unto
boaz
buy
it
for
thee
so
he
drew
off
his
shoe
4
9
and
boaz
said
unto
the
elders
and
unto
all
the
people
ye
are
witnesses
this
day
that
i
have
bought
all
that
was
elimelech’s
and
all
that
was
chilion’s
and
mahlon’s
of
the
hand
of
naomi
4
10
moreover
ruth
the
moabitess
the
wife
of
mahlon
have
i
purchased
to
be
my
wife
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance
that
the
name
of
the
dead
be
not
cut
off
from
among
his
brethren
and
from
the
gate
of
his
place
ye
are
witnesses
this
day
4
11
and
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
gate
and
the
elders
said
we
are
witnesses
the
lord
make
the
woman
that
is
come
into
thine
house
like
rachel
and
like
leah
which
two
did
build
the
house
of
israel
and
do
thou
worthily
in
ephratah
and
be
famous
in
bethlehem
4
12
and
let
thy
house
be
like
the
house
of
pharez
whom
tamar
bare
unto
judah
of
the
seed
which
the
lord
shall
give
thee
of
this
young
woman
4
13
so
boaz
took
ruth
and
she
was
his
wife
and
when
he
went
in
unto
her
the
lord
gave
her
conception
and
she
bare
a
son
4
14
and
the
women
said
unto
naomi
blessed
be
the
lord
which
hath
not
left
thee
this
day
without
a
kinsman
that
his
name
may
be
famous
in
israel
4
15
and
he
shall
be
unto
thee
a
restorer
of
thy
life
and
a
nourisher
of
thine
old
age
for
thy
daughter
in
law
which
loveth
thee
which
is
better
to
thee
than
seven
sons
hath
born
him
4
16
and
naomi
took
the
child
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom
and
became
nurse
unto
it
4
17
and
the
women
her
neighbours
gave
it
a
name
saying
there
is
a
son
born
to
naomi
and
they
called
his
name
obed
he
is
the
father
of
jesse
the
father
of
david
4
18
now
these
are
the
generations
of
pharez
pharez
begat

19
and

and

and
jesse
begat
david
the
first
book
of
samuel
otherwise
called
the
first
book
of
the
kings
1
1
now
there
was
a
certain
man
of
ramathaimzophim
of
mount
ephraim
and
his
name
was
elkanah
the
son
of
jeroham
the
son
of
elihu
the
son
of
tohu
the
son
of
zuph
an
ephrathite
1
2
and
he
had
two
wives
the
name
of
the
one
was
hannah
and
the
name
of
the
other
peninnah
and
peninnah
had
children
but
hannah
had
no
children
1
3
and
this
man
went
up
out
of
his
city
yearly
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
in
shiloh
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
the
priests
of
the
lord
were
there
1
4
and
when
the
time
was
that
elkanah
offered
he
gave
to
peninnah
his
wife
and
to
all
her
sons
and
her
daughters
portions
1
5
but
unto
hannah
he
gave
a
worthy
portion
for
he
loved
hannah
but
the
lord
had
shut
up
her
womb
1
6
and
her
adversary
also
provoked
her
sore
for
to
make
her
fret
because
the
lord
had
shut
up
her
womb
1
7
and
as
he
did
so
year
by
year
when
she
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
so
she
provoked
her
therefore
she
wept
and
did
not
eat
1
8
then
said
elkanah
her
husband
to
her
hannah
why
weepest
thou
and
why
eatest
thou
not
and
why
is
thy
heart
grieved
am
not
i
better
to
thee
than
ten
sons
1
9
so
hannah
rose
up
after
they
had
eaten
in
shiloh
and
after
they
had
drunk
now
eli
the
priest
sat
upon
a
seat
by
a
post
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
1
10
and
she
was
in
bitterness
of
soul
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
wept
sore
1
11
and
she
vowed
a
vow
and
said
o
lord
of
hosts
if
thou
wilt
indeed
look
on
the
affliction
of
thine
handmaid
and
remember
me
and
not
forget
thine
handmaid
but
wilt
give
unto
thine
handmaid
a
man
child
then
i
will
give
him
unto
the
lord
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
there
shall
no
razor
come
upon
his
head
1
12
and
it
came
to
pass
as
she
continued
praying
before
the
lord
that
eli
marked
her
mouth
1
13
now
hannah
she
spake
in
her
heart
only
her
lips
moved
but
her
voice
was
not
heard
therefore
eli
thought
she
had
been
drunken
1
14
and
eli
said
unto
her
how
long
wilt
thou
be
drunken
put
away
thy
wine
from
thee
1
15
and
hannah
answered
and
said
no
my
lord
i
am
a
woman
of
a
sorrowful
spirit
i
have
drunk
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink
but
have
poured
out
my
soul
before
the
lord
1
16
count
not
thine
handmaid
for
a
daughter
of
belial
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
my
complaint
and
grief
have
i
spoken
hitherto
1
17
then
eli
answered
and
said
go
in
peace
and
the
god
of
israel
grant
thee
thy
petition
that
thou
hast
asked
of
him
1
18
and
she
said
let
thine
handmaid
find
grace
in
thy
sight
so
the
woman
went
her
way
and
did
eat
and
her
countenance
was
no
more
sad
1
19
and
they
rose
up
in
the
morning
early
and
worshipped
before
the
lord
and
returned
and
came
to
their
house
to
ramah
and
elkanah
knew
hannah
his
wife
and
the
lord
remembered
her
1
20
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
when
the
time
was
come
about
after
hannah
had
conceived
that
she
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
samuel
saying
because
i
have
asked
him
of
the
lord
1
21
and
the
man
elkanah
and
all
his
house
went
up
to
offer
unto
the
lord
the
yearly
sacrifice
and
his
vow
1
22
but
hannah
went
not
up
for
she
said
unto
her
husband
i
will
not
go
up
until
the
child
be
weaned
and
then
i
will
bring
him
that
he
may
appear
before
the
lord
and
there
abide
for
ever
1
23
and
elkanah
her
husband
said
unto
her
do
what
seemeth
thee
good
tarry
until
thou
have
weaned
him
only
the
lord
establish
his
word
so
the
woman
abode
and
gave
her
son
suck
until
she
weaned
him
1
24
and
when
she
had
weaned
him
she
took
him
up
with
her
with
three
bullocks
and
one
ephah
of
flour
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
brought
him
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
in
shiloh
and
the
child
was
young
1
25
and
they
slew
a
bullock
and
brought
the
child
to
eli
1
26
and
she
said
oh
my
lord
as
thy
soul
liveth
my
lord
i
am
the
woman
that
stood
by
thee
here
praying
unto
the
lord
1
27
for
this
child
i
prayed
and
the
lord
hath
given
me
my
petition
which
i
asked
of
him
1
28
therefore
also
i
have
lent
him
to
the
lord
as
long
as
he
liveth
he
shall
be
lent
to
the
lord
and
he
worshipped
the
lord
there
2
1
and
hannah
prayed
and
said
my
heart
rejoiceth
in
the
lord
mine
horn
is
exalted
in
the
lord
my
mouth
is
enlarged
over
mine
enemies
because
i
rejoice
in
thy
salvation
2
2
there
is
none
holy
as
the
lord
for
there
is
none
beside
thee
neither
is
there
any
rock
like
our
god
2
3
talk
no
more
so
exceeding
proudly
let
not
arrogancy
come
out
of
your
mouth
for
the
lord
is
a
god
of
knowledge
and
by
him
actions
are
weighed
2
4
the
bows
of
the
mighty
men
are
broken
and
they
that
stumbled
are
girded
with
strength
2
5
they
that
were
full
have
hired
out
themselves
for
bread
and
they
that
were
hungry
ceased
so
that
the
barren
hath
born
seven
and
she
that
hath
many
children
is
waxed
feeble
2
6
the
lord
killeth
and
maketh
alive
he
bringeth
down
to
the
grave
and
bringeth
up
2
7
the
lord
maketh
poor
and
maketh
rich
he
bringeth
low
and
lifteth
up
2
8
he
raiseth
up
the
poor
out
of
the
dust
and
lifteth
up
the
beggar
from
the
dunghill
to
set
them
among
princes
and
to
make
them
inherit
the
throne
of
glory
for
the
pillars
of
the
earth
are
the
lord’s
and
he
hath
set
the
world
upon
them
2
9
he
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
saints
and
the
wicked
shall
be
silent
in
darkness
for
by
strength
shall
no
man
prevail
2
10
the
adversaries
of
the
lord
shall
be
broken
to
pieces
out
of
heaven
shall
he
thunder
upon
them
the
lord
shall
judge
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
give
strength
unto
his
king
and
exalt
the
horn
of
his
anointed
2
11
and
elkanah
went
to
ramah
to
his
house
and
the
child
did
minister
unto
the
lord
before
eli
the
priest
2
12
now
the
sons
of
eli
were
sons
of
belial
they
knew
not
the
lord
2
13
and
the
priest’s
custom
with
the
people
was
that
when
any
man
offered
sacrifice
the
priest’s
servant
came
while
the
flesh
was
in
seething
with
a
fleshhook
of
three
teeth
in
his
hand
2
14
and
he
struck
it
into
the
pan
or
kettle
or
caldron
or
pot
all
that
the
fleshhook
brought
up
the
priest
took
for
himself
so
they
did
in
shiloh
unto
all
the
israelites
that
came
thither
2
15
also
before
they
burnt
the
fat
the
priest’s
servant
came
and
said
to
the
man
that
sacrificed
give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
priest
for
he
will
not
have
sodden
flesh
of
thee
but
raw
2
16
and
if
any
man
said
unto
him
let
them
not
fail
to
burn
the
fat
presently
and
then
take
as
much
as
thy
soul
desireth
then
he
would
answer
him
nay
but
thou
shalt
give
it
me
now
and
if
not
i
will
take
it
by
force
2
17
wherefore
the
sin
of
the
young
men
was
very
great
before
the
lord
for
men
abhorred
the
offering
of
the
lord
2
18
but
samuel
ministered
before
the
lord
being
a
child
girded
with
a
linen
ephod
2
19
moreover
his
mother
made
him
a
little
coat
and
brought
it
to
him
from
year
to
year
when
she
came
up
with
her
husband
to
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice
2
20
and
eli
blessed
elkanah
and
his
wife
and
said
the
lord
give
thee
seed
of
this
woman
for
the
loan
which
is
lent
to
the
lord
and
they
went
unto
their
own
home
2
21
and
the
lord
visited
hannah
so
that
she
conceived
and
bare
three
sons
and
two
daughters
and
the
child
samuel
grew
before
the
lord
2
22
now
eli
was
very
old
and
heard
all
that
his
sons
did
unto
all
israel
and
how
they
lay
with
the
women
that
assembled
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
2
23
and
he
said
unto
them
why
do
ye
such
things
for
i
hear
of
your
evil
dealings
by
all
this
people
2
24
nay
my
sons
for
it
is
no
good
report
that
i
hear
ye
make
the
lord’s
people
to
transgress
2
25
if
one
man
sin
against
another
the
judge
shall
judge
him
but
if
a
man
sin
against
the
lord
who
shall
intreat
for
him
notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
their
father
because
the
lord
would
slay
them
2
26
and
the
child
samuel
grew
on
and
was
in
favour
both
with
the
lord
and
also
with
men
2
27
and
there
came
a
man
of
god
unto
eli
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
did
i
plainly
appear
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
when
they
were
in
egypt
in
pharaoh’s
house
2
28
and
did
i
choose
him
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
be
my
priest
to
offer
upon
mine
altar
to
burn
incense
to
wear
an
ephod
before
me
and
did
i
give
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
all
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
children
of
israel
2
29
wherefore
kick
ye
at
my
sacrifice
and
at
mine
offering
which
i
have
commanded
in
my
habitation
and
honourest
thy
sons
above
me
to
make
yourselves
fat
with
the
chiefest
of
all
the
offerings
of
israel
my
people
2
30
wherefore
the
lord
god
of
israel
saith
i
said
indeed
that
thy
house
and
the
house
of
thy
father
should
walk
before
me
for
ever
but
now
the
lord
saith
be
it
far
from
me
for
them
that
honour
me
i
will
honour
and
they
that
despise
me
shall
be
lightly
esteemed
2
31
behold
the
days
come
that
i
will
cut
off
thine
arm
and
the
arm
of
thy
father’s
house
that
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
2
32
and
thou
shalt
see
an
enemy
in
my
habitation
in
all
the
wealth
which
god
shall
give
israel
and
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
for
ever
2
33
and
the
man
of
thine
whom
i
shall
not
cut
off
from
mine
altar
shall
be
to
consume
thine
eyes
and
to
grieve
thine
heart
and
all
the
increase
of
thine
house
shall
die
in
the
flower
of
their
age
2
34
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
shall
come
upon
thy
two
sons
on
hophni
and
phinehas
in
one
day
they
shall
die
both
of
them
2
35
and
i
will
raise
me
up
a
faithful
priest
that
shall
do
according
to
that
which
is
in
mine
heart
and
in
my
mind
and
i
will
build
him
a
sure
house
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
ever
2
36
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
one
that
is
left
in
thine
house
shall
come
and
crouch
to
him
for
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
morsel
of
bread
and
shall
say
put
me
i
pray
thee
into
one
of
the
priests’
offices
that
i
may
eat
a
piece
of
bread
3
1
and
the
child
samuel
ministered
unto
the
lord
before
eli
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
precious
in
those
days
there
was
no
open
vision
3
2
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
eli
was
laid
down
in
his
place
and
his
eyes
began
to
wax
dim
that
he
could
not
see
3
3
and
ere
the
lamp
of
god
went
out
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
where
the
ark
of
god
was
and
samuel
was
laid
down
to
sleep
3
4
that
the
lord
called
samuel
and
he
answered
here
am
i
3
5
and
he
ran
unto
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
calledst
me
and
he
said
i
called
not
lie
down
again
and
he
went
and
lay
down
3
6
and
the
lord
called
yet
again
samuel
and
samuel
arose
and
went
to
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
didst
call
me
and
he
answered
i
called
not
my
son
lie
down
again
3
7
now
samuel
did
not
yet
know
the
lord
neither
was
the
word
of
the
lord
yet
revealed
unto
him
3
8
and
the
lord
called
samuel
again
the
third
time
and
he
arose
and
went
to
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
didst
call
me
and
eli
perceived
that
the
lord
had
called
the
child
3
9
therefore
eli
said
unto
samuel
go
lie
down
and
it
shall
be
if
he
call
thee
that
thou
shalt
say
speak
lord
for
thy
servant
heareth
so
samuel
went
and
lay
down
in
his
place
3
10
and
the
lord
came
and
stood
and
called
as
at
other
times
samuel
samuel
then
samuel
answered
speak
for
thy
servant
heareth
3
11
and
the
lord
said
to
samuel
behold
i
will
do
a
thing
in
israel
at
which
both
the
ears
of
every
one
that
heareth
it
shall
tingle
3
12
in
that
day
i
will
perform
against
eli
all
things
which
i
have
spoken
concerning
his
house
when
i
begin
i
will
also
make
an
end
3
13
for
i
have
told
him
that
i
will
judge
his
house
for
ever
for
the
iniquity
which
he
knoweth
because
his
sons
made
themselves
vile
and
he
restrained
them
not
3
14
and
therefore
i
have
sworn
unto
the
house
of
eli
that
the
iniquity
of
eli’s
house
shall
not
be
purged
with
sacrifice
nor
offering
for
ever
3
15
and
samuel
lay
until
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
samuel
feared
to
shew
eli
the
vision
3
16
then
eli
called
samuel
and
said
samuel
my
son
and
he
answered
here
am
i
3
17
and
he
said
what
is
the
thing
that
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thee
i
pray
thee
hide
it
not
from
me
god
do
so
to
thee
and
more
also
if
thou
hide
any
thing
from
me
of
all
the
things
that
he
said
unto
thee
3
18
and
samuel
told
him
every
whit
and
hid
nothing
from
him
and
he
said
it
is
the
lord
let
him
do
what
seemeth
him
good
3
19
and
samuel
grew
and
the
lord
was
with
him
and
did
let
none
of
his
words
fall
to
the
ground
3
20
and
all
israel
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
knew
that
samuel
was
established
to
be
a
prophet
of
the
lord
3
21
and
the
lord
appeared
again
in
shiloh
for
the
lord
revealed
himself
to
samuel
in
shiloh
by
the
word
of
the
lord
4
1
and
the
word
of
samuel
came
to
all
israel
now
israel
went
out
against
the
philistines
to
battle
and
pitched
beside
ebenezer
and
the
philistines
pitched
in
aphek
4
2
and
the
philistines
put
themselves
in
array
against
israel
and
when
they
joined
battle
israel
was
smitten
before
the
philistines
and
they
slew
of
the
army
in
the
field
about
four
thousand
men
4
3
and
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
camp
the
elders
of
israel
said
wherefore
hath
the
lord
smitten
us
to
day
before
the
philistines
let
us
fetch
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
out
of
shiloh
unto
us
that
when
it
cometh
among
us
it
may
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
4
4
so
the
people
sent
to
shiloh
that
they
might
bring
from
thence
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
were
there
with
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
4
5
and
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
came
into
the
camp
all
israel
shouted
with
a
great
shout
so
that
the
earth
rang
again
4
6
and
when
the
philistines
heard
the
noise
of
the
shout
they
said
what
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
great
shout
in
the
camp
of
the
hebrews
and
they
understood
that
the
ark
of
the
lord
was
come
into
the
camp
4
7
and
the
philistines
were
afraid
for
they
said
god
is
come
into
the
camp
and
they
said
woe
unto
us
for
there
hath
not
been
such
a
thing
heretofore
4
8
woe
unto
us
who
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
these
mighty
gods
these
are
the
gods
that
smote
the
egyptians
with
all
the
plagues
in
the
wilderness
4
9
be
strong
and
quit
yourselves
like
men
o
ye
philistines
that
ye
be
not
servants
unto
the
hebrews
as
they
have
been
to
you
quit
yourselves
like
men
and
fight
4
10
and
the
philistines
fought
and
israel
was
smitten
and
they
fled
every
man
into
his
tent
and
there
was
a
very
great
slaughter
for
there
fell
of
israel
thirty
thousand
footmen
4
11
and
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
were
slain
4
12
and
there
ran
a
man
of
benjamin
out
of
the
army
and
came
to
shiloh
the
same
day
with
his
clothes
rent
and
with
earth
upon
his
head
4
13
and
when
he
came
lo
eli
sat
upon
a
seat
by
the
wayside
watching
for
his
heart
trembled
for
the
ark
of
god
and
when
the
man
came
into
the
city
and
told
it
all
the
city
cried
out
4
14
and
when
eli
heard
the
noise
of
the
crying
he
said
what
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
tumult
and
the
man
came
in
hastily
and
told
eli
4
15
now
eli
was
ninety
and
eight
years
old
and
his
eyes
were
dim
that
he
could
not
see
4
16
and
the
man
said
unto
eli
i
am
he
that
came
out
of
the
army
and
i
fled
to
day
out
of
the
army
and
he
said
what
is
there
done
my
son
4
17
and
the
messenger
answered
and
said
israel
is
fled
before
the
philistines
and
there
hath
been
also
a
great
slaughter
among
the
people
and
thy
two
sons
also
hophni
and
phinehas
are
dead
and
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
4
18
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
made
mention
of
the
ark
of
god
that
he
fell
from
off
the
seat
backward
by
the
side
of
the
gate
and
his
neck
brake
and
he
died
for
he
was
an
old
man
and
heavy
and
he
had
judged
israel
forty
years
4
19
and
his
daughter
in
law
phinehas’
wife
was
with
child
near
to
be
delivered
and
when
she
heard
the
tidings
that
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
that
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
were
dead
she
bowed
herself
and
travailed
for
her
pains
came
upon
her
4
20
and
about
the
time
of
her
death
the
women
that
stood
by
her
said
unto
her
fear
not
for
thou
hast
born
a
son
but
she
answered
not
neither
did
she
regard
it
4
21
and
she
named
the
child
ichabod
saying
the
glory
is
departed
from
israel
because
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
because
of
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
4
22
and
she
said
the
glory
is
departed
from
israel
for
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
5
1
and
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
and
brought
it
from
ebenezer
unto
ashdod
5
2
when
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
they
brought
it
into
the
house
of
dagon
and
set
it
by
dagon
5
3
and
when
they
of
ashdod
arose
early
on
the
morrow
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
they
took
dagon
and
set
him
in
his
place
again
5
4
and
when
they
arose
early
on
the
morrow
morning
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
head
of
dagon
and
both
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
cut
off
upon
the
threshold
only
the
stump
of
dagon
was
left
to
him
5
5
therefore
neither
the
priests
of
dagon
nor
any
that
come
into
dagon’s
house
tread
on
the
threshold
of
dagon
in
ashdod
unto
this
day
5
6
but
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
heavy
upon
them
of
ashdod
and
he
destroyed
them
and
smote
them
with
emerods
even
ashdod
and
the
coasts
thereof
5
7
and
when
the
men
of
ashdod
saw
that
it
was
so
they
said
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
shall
not
abide
with
us
for
his
hand
is
sore
upon
us
and
upon
dagon
our
god
5
8
they
sent
therefore
and
gathered
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
unto
them
and
said
what
shall
we
do
with
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
and
they
answered
let
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
be
carried
about
unto
gath
and
they
carried
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
about
thither
5
9
and
it
was
so
that
after
they
had
carried
it
about
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
the
city
with
a
very
great
destruction
and
he
smote
the
men
of
the
city
both
small
and
great
and
they
had
emerods
in
their
secret
parts
5
10
therefore
they
sent
the
ark
of
god
to
ekron
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
ark
of
god
came
to
ekron
that
the
ekronites
cried
out
saying
they
have
brought
about
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
to
us
to
slay
us
and
our
people
5
11
so
they
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
and
said
send
away
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
and
let
it
go
again
to
his
own
place
that
it
slay
us
not
and
our
people
for
there
was
a
deadly
destruction
throughout
all
the
city
the
hand
of
god
was
very
heavy
there
5
12
and
the
men
that
died
not
were
smitten
with
the
emerods
and
the
cry
of
the
city
went
up
to
heaven
6
1
and
the
ark
of
the
lord
was
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
seven
months
6
2
and
the
philistines
called
for
the
priests
and
the
diviners
saying
what
shall
we
do
to
the
ark
of
the
lord
tell
us
wherewith
we
shall
send
it
to
his
place
6
3
and
they
said
if
ye
send
away
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
send
it
not
empty
but
in
any
wise
return
him
a
trespass
offering
then
ye
shall
be
healed
and
it
shall
be
known
to
you
why
his
hand
is
not
removed
from
you
6
4
then
said
they
what
shall
be
the
trespass
offering
which
we
shall
return
to
him
they
answered
five
golden
emerods
and
five
golden
mice
according
to
the
number
of
the
lords
of
the
philistines
for
one
plague
was
on
you
all
and
on
your
lords
6
5
wherefore
ye
shall
make
images
of
your
emerods
and
images
of
your
mice
that
mar
the
land
and
ye
shall
give
glory
unto
the
god
of
israel
peradventure
he
will
lighten
his
hand
from
off
you
and
from
off
your
gods
and
from
off
your
land
6
6
wherefore
then
do
ye
harden
your
hearts
as
the
egyptians
and
pharaoh
hardened
their
hearts
when
he
had
wrought
wonderfully
among
them
did
they
not
let
the
people
go
and
they
departed
6
7
now
therefore
make
a
new
cart
and
take
two
milch
kine
on
which
there
hath
come
no
yoke
and
tie
the
kine
to
the
cart
and
bring
their
calves
home
from
them
6
8
and
take
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
lay
it
upon
the
cart
and
put
the
jewels
of
gold
which
ye
return
him
for
a
trespass
offering
in
a
coffer
by
the
side
thereof
and
send
it
away
that
it
may
go
6
9
and
see
if
it
goeth
up
by
the
way
of
his
own
coast
to
bethshemesh
then
he
hath
done
us
this
great
evil
but
if
not
then
we
shall
know
that
it
is
not
his
hand
that
smote
us
it
was
a
chance
that
happened
to
us
6
10
and
the
men
did
so
and
took
two
milch
kine
and
tied
them
to
the
cart
and
shut
up
their
calves
at
home
6
11
and
they
laid
the
ark
of
the
lord
upon
the
cart
and
the
coffer
with
the
mice
of
gold
and
the
images
of
their
emerods
6
12
and
the
kine
took
the
straight
way
to
the
way
of
bethshemesh
and
went
along
the
highway
lowing
as
they
went
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
went
after
them
unto
the
border
of
bethshemesh
6
13
and
they
of
bethshemesh
were
reaping
their
wheat
harvest
in
the
valley
and
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
saw
the
ark
and
rejoiced
to
see
it
6
14
and
the
cart
came
into
the
field
of
joshua
a
bethshemite
and
stood
there
where
there
was
a
great
stone
and
they
clave
the
wood
of
the
cart
and
offered
the
kine
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
6
15
and
the
levites
took
down
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
coffer
that
was
with
it
wherein
the
jewels
of
gold
were
and
put
them
on
the
great
stone
and
the
men
of
bethshemesh
offered
burnt
offerings
and
sacrificed
sacrifices
the
same
day
unto
the
lord
6
16
and
when
the
five
lords
of
the
philistines
had
seen
it
they
returned
to
ekron
the
same
day
6
17
and
these
are
the
golden
emerods
which
the
philistines
returned
for
a
trespass
offering
unto
the
lord
for
ashdod
one
for
gaza
one
for
askelon
one
for
gath
one
for
ekron
one
6
18
and
the
golden
mice
according
to
the
number
of
all
the
cities
of
the
philistines
belonging
to
the
five
lords
both
of
fenced
cities
and
of
country
villages
even
unto
the
great
stone
of
abel
whereon
they
set
down
the
ark
of
the
lord
which
stone
remaineth
unto
this
day
in
the
field
of
joshua
the
bethshemite
6
19
and
he
smote
the
men
of
bethshemesh
because
they
had
looked
into
the
ark
of
the
lord
even
he
smote
of
the
people
fifty
thousand
and
threescore
and
ten
men
and
the
people
lamented
because
the
lord
had
smitten
many
of
the
people
with
a
great
slaughter
6
20
and
the
men
of
bethshemesh
said
who
is
able
to
stand
before
this
holy
lord
god
and
to
whom
shall
he
go
up
from
us
6
21
and
they
sent
messengers
to
the
inhabitants
of
kirjathjearim
saying
the
philistines
have
brought
again
the
ark
of
the
lord
come
ye
down
and
fetch
it
up
to
you
7
1
and
the
men
of
kirjathjearim
came
and
fetched
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
brought
it
into
the
house
of
abinadab
in
the
hill
and
sanctified
eleazar
his
son
to
keep
the
ark
of
the
lord
7
2
and
it
came
to
pass
while
the
ark
abode
in
kirjathjearim
that
the
time
was
long
for
it
was
twenty
years
and
all
the
house
of
israel
lamented
after
the
lord
7
3
and
samuel
spake
unto
all
the
house
of
israel
saying
if
ye
do
return
unto
the
lord
with
all
your
hearts
then
put
away
the
strange
gods
and
ashtaroth
from
among
you
and
prepare
your
hearts
unto
the
lord
and
serve
him
only
and
he
will
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
7
4
then
the
children
of
israel
did
put
away
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
served
the
lord
only
7
5
and
samuel
said
gather
all
israel
to
mizpeh
and
i
will
pray
for
you
unto
the
lord
7
6
and
they
gathered
together
to
mizpeh
and
drew
water
and
poured
it
out
before
the
lord
and
fasted
on
that
day
and
said
there
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
samuel
judged
the
children
of
israel
in
mizpeh
7
7
and
when
the
philistines
heard
that
the
children
of
israel
were
gathered
together
to
mizpeh
the
lords
of
the
philistines
went
up
against
israel
and
when
the
children
of
israel
heard
it
they
were
afraid
of
the
philistines
7
8
and
the
children
of
israel
said
to
samuel
cease
not
to
cry
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
us
that
he
will
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
7
9
and
samuel
took
a
sucking
lamb
and
offered
it
for
a
burnt
offering
wholly
unto
the
lord
and
samuel
cried
unto
the
lord
for
israel
and
the
lord
heard
him
7
10
and
as
samuel
was
offering
up
the
burnt
offering
the
philistines
drew
near
to
battle
against
israel
but
the
lord
thundered
with
a
great
thunder
on
that
day
upon
the
philistines
and
discomfited
them
and
they
were
smitten
before
israel
7
11
and
the
men
of
israel
went
out
of
mizpeh
and
pursued
the
philistines
and
smote
them
until
they
came
under
bethcar
7
12
then
samuel
took
a
stone
and
set
it
between
mizpeh
and
shen
and
called
the
name
of
it
ebenezer
saying
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
us
7
13
so
the
philistines
were
subdued
and
they
came
no
more
into
the
coast
of
israel
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
the
philistines
all
the
days
of
samuel
7
14
and
the
cities
which
the
philistines
had
taken
from
israel
were
restored
to
israel
from
ekron
even
unto
gath
and
the
coasts
thereof
did
israel
deliver
out
of
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
there
was
peace
between
israel
and
the
amorites
7
15
and
samuel
judged
israel
all
the
days
of
his
life
7
16
and
he
went
from
year
to
year
in
circuit
to
bethel
and
gilgal
and
mizpeh
and
judged
israel
in
all
those
places
7
17
and
his
return
was
to
ramah
for
there
was
his
house
and
there
he
judged
israel
and
there
he
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
8
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
samuel
was
old
that
he
made
his
sons
judges
over
israel
8
2
now
the
name
of
his
firstborn
was
joel
and
the
name
of
his
second
abiah
they
were
judges
in
beersheba
8
3
and
his
sons
walked
not
in
his
ways
but
turned
aside
after
lucre
and
took
bribes
and
perverted
judgment
8
4
then
all
the
elders
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
to
samuel
unto
ramah
8
5
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
old
and
thy
sons
walk
not
in
thy
ways
now
make
us
a
king
to
judge
us
like
all
the
nations
8
6
but
the
thing
displeased
samuel
when
they
said
give
us
a
king
to
judge
us
and
samuel
prayed
unto
the
lord
8
7
and
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
people
in
all
that
they
say
unto
thee
for
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
me
that
i
should
not
reign
over
them
8
8
according
to
all
the
works
which
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
wherewith
they
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
so
do
they
also
unto
thee
8
9
now
therefore
hearken
unto
their
voice
howbeit
yet
protest
solemnly
unto
them
and
shew
them
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
them
8
10
and
samuel
told
all
the
words
of
the
lord
unto
the
people
that
asked
of
him
a
king
8
11
and
he
said
this
will
be
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
you
he
will
take
your
sons
and
appoint
them
for
himself
for
his
chariots
and
to
be
his
horsemen
and
some
shall
run
before
his
chariots
8
12
and
he
will
appoint
him
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
fifties
and
will
set
them
to
ear
his
ground
and
to
reap
his
harvest
and
to
make
his
instruments
of
war
and
instruments
of
his
chariots
8
13
and
he
will
take
your
daughters
to
be
confectionaries
and
to
be
cooks
and
to
be
bakers
8
14
and
he
will
take
your
fields
and
your
vineyards
and
your
oliveyards
even
the
best
of
them
and
give
them
to
his
servants
8
15
and
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
seed
and
of
your
vineyards
and
give
to
his
officers
and
to
his
servants
8
16
and
he
will
take
your
menservants
and
your
maidservants
and
your
goodliest
young
men
and
your
asses
and
put
them
to
his
work
8
17
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
sheep
and
ye
shall
be
his
servants
8
18
and
ye
shall
cry
out
in
that
day
because
of
your
king
which
ye
shall
have
chosen
you
and
the
lord
will
not
hear
you
in
that
day
8
19
nevertheless
the
people
refused
to
obey
the
voice
of
samuel
and
they
said
nay
but
we
will
have
a
king
over
us
8
20
that
we
also
may
be
like
all
the
nations
and
that
our
king
may
judge
us
and
go
out
before
us
and
fight
our
battles
8
21
and
samuel
heard
all
the
words
of
the
people
and
he
rehearsed
them
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
8
22
and
the
lord
said
to
samuel
hearken
unto
their
voice
and
make
them
a
king
and
samuel
said
unto
the
men
of
israel
go
ye
every
man
unto
his
city
9
1
now
there
was
a
man
of
benjamin
whose
name
was
kish
the
son
of
abiel
the
son
of
zeror
the
son
of
bechorath
the
son
of
aphiah
a
benjamite
a
mighty
man
of
power
9
2
and
he
had
a
son
whose
name
was
saul
a
choice
young
man
and
a
goodly
and
there
was
not
among
the
children
of
israel
a
goodlier
person
than
he
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
9
3
and
the
asses
of
kish
saul’s
father
were
lost
and
kish
said
to
saul
his
son
take
now
one
of
the
servants
with
thee
and
arise
go
seek
the
asses
9
4
and
he
passed
through
mount
ephraim
and
passed
through
the
land
of
shalisha
but
they
found
them
not
then
they
passed
through
the
land
of
shalim
and
there
they
were
not
and
he
passed
through
the
land
of
the
benjamites
but
they
found
them
not
9
5
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
land
of
zuph
saul
said
to
his
servant
that
was
with
him
come
and
let
us
return
lest
my
father
leave
caring
for
the
asses
and
take
thought
for
us
9
6
and
he
said
unto
him
behold
now
there
is
in
this
city
a
man
of
god
and
he
is
an
honourable
man
all
that
he
saith
cometh
surely
to
pass
now
let
us
go
thither
peradventure
he
can
shew
us
our
way
that
we
should
go
9
7
then
said
saul
to
his
servant
but
behold
if
we
go
what
shall
we
bring
the
man
for
the
bread
is
spent
in
our
vessels
and
there
is
not
a
present
to
bring
to
the
man
of
god
what
have
we
9
8
and
the
servant
answered
saul
again
and
said
behold
i
have
here
at
hand
the
fourth
part
of
a
shekel
of
silver
that
will
i
give
to
the
man
of
god
to
tell
us
our
way
9
9
(beforetime
in
israel
when
a
man
went
to
enquire
of
god
thus
he
spake
come
and
let
us
go
to
the
seer
for
he
that
is
now
called
a
prophet
was
beforetime
called
a
seer
)
9
10
then
said
saul
to
his
servant
well
said
come
let
us
go
so
they
went
unto
the
city
where
the
man
of
god
was
9
11
and
as
they
went
up
the
hill
to
the
city
they
found
young
maidens
going
out
to
draw
water
and
said
unto
them
is
the
seer
here
9
12
and
they
answered
them
and
said
he
is
behold
he
is
before
you
make
haste
now
for
he
came
to
day
to
the
city
for
there
is
a
sacrifice
of
the
people
to
day
in
the
high
place
9
13
as
soon
as
ye
be
come
into
the
city
ye
shall
straightway
find
him
before
he
go
up
to
the
high
place
to
eat
for
the
people
will
not
eat
until
he
come
because
he
doth
bless
the
sacrifice
and
afterwards
they
eat
that
be
bidden
now
therefore
get
you
up
for
about
this
time
ye
shall
find
him
9
14
and
they
went
up
into
the
city
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
city
behold
samuel
came
out
against
them
for
to
go
up
to
the
high
place
9
15
now
the
lord
had
told
samuel
in
his
ear
a
day
before
saul
came
saying
9
16
to
morrow
about
this
time
i
will
send
thee
a
man
out
of
the
land
of
benjamin
and
thou
shalt
anoint
him
to
be
captain
over
my
people
israel
that
he
may
save
my
people
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
for
i
have
looked
upon
my
people
because
their
cry
is
come
unto
me
9
17
and
when
samuel
saw
saul
the
lord
said
unto
him
behold
the
man
whom
i
spake
to
thee
of
this
same
shall
reign
over
my
people
9
18
then
saul
drew
near
to
samuel
in
the
gate
and
said
tell
me
i
pray
thee
where
the
seer’s
house
is
9
19
and
samuel
answered
saul
and
said
i
am
the
seer
go
up
before
me
unto
the
high
place
for
ye
shall
eat
with
me
to
day
and
to
morrow
i
will
let
thee
go
and
will
tell
thee
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
9
20
and
as
for
thine
asses
that
were
lost
three
days
ago
set
not
thy
mind
on
them
for
they
are
found
and
on
whom
is
all
the
desire
of
israel
is
it
not
on
thee
and
on
all
thy
father’s
house
9
21
and
saul
answered
and
said
am
not
i
a
benjamite
of
the
smallest
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
my
family
the
least
of
all
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
wherefore
then
speakest
thou
so
to
me
9
22
and
samuel
took
saul
and
his
servant
and
brought
them
into
the
parlour
and
made
them
sit
in
the
chiefest
place
among
them
that
were
bidden
which
were
about
thirty
persons
9
23
and
samuel
said
unto
the
cook
bring
the
portion
which
i
gave
thee
of
which
i
said
unto
thee
set
it
by
thee
9
24
and
the
cook
took
up
the
shoulder
and
that
which
was
upon
it
and
set
it
before
saul
and
samuel
said
behold
that
which
is
left
set
it
before
thee
and
eat
for
unto
this
time
hath
it
been
kept
for
thee
since
i
said
i
have
invited
the
people
so
saul
did
eat
with
samuel
that
day
9
25
and
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
high
place
into
the
city
samuel
communed
with
saul
upon
the
top
of
the
house
9
26
and
they
arose
early
and
it
came
to
pass
about
the
spring
of
the
day
that
samuel
called
saul
to
the
top
of
the
house
saying
up
that
i
may
send
thee
away
and
saul
arose
and
they
went
out
both
of
them
he
and
samuel
abroad
9
27
and
as
they
were
going
down
to
the
end
of
the
city
samuel
said
to
saul
bid
the
servant
pass
on
before
us
(and
he
passed
on)
but
stand
thou
still
a
while
that
i
may
shew
thee
the
word
of
god
10
1
then
samuel
took
a
vial
of
oil
and
poured
it
upon
his
head
and
kissed
him
and
said
is
it
not
because
the
lord
hath
anointed
thee
to
be
captain
over
his
inheritance
10
2
when
thou
art
departed
from
me
to
day
then
thou
shalt
find
two
men
by
rachel’s
sepulchre
in
the
border
of
benjamin
at
zelzah
and
they
will
say
unto
thee
the
asses
which
thou
wentest
to
seek
are
found
and
lo
thy
father
hath
left
the
care
of
the
asses
and
sorroweth
for
you
saying
what
shall
i
do
for
my
son
10
3
then
shalt
thou
go
on
forward
from
thence
and
thou
shalt
come
to
the
plain
of
tabor
and
there
shall
meet
thee
three
men
going
up
to
god
to
bethel
one
carrying
three
kids
and
another
carrying
three
loaves
of
bread
and
another
carrying
a
bottle
of
wine
10
4
and
they
will
salute
thee
and
give
thee
two
loaves
of
bread
which
thou
shalt
receive
of
their
hands
10
5
after
that
thou
shalt
come
to
the
hill
of
god
where
is
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
art
come
thither
to
the
city
that
thou
shalt
meet
a
company
of
prophets
coming
down
from
the
high
place
with
a
psaltery
and
a
tabret
and
a
pipe
and
a
harp
before
them
and
they
shall
prophesy
10
6
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
come
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
with
them
and
shalt
be
turned
into
another
man
10
7
and
let
it
be
when
these
signs
are
come
unto
thee
that
thou
do
as
occasion
serve
thee
for
god
is
with
thee
10
8
and
thou
shalt
go
down
before
me
to
gilgal
and
behold
i
will
come
down
unto
thee
to
offer
burnt
offerings
and
to
sacrifice
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
seven
days
shalt
thou
tarry
till
i
come
to
thee
and
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
10
9
and
it
was
so
that
when
he
had
turned
his
back
to
go
from
samuel
god
gave
him
another
heart
and
all
those
signs
came
to
pass
that
day
10
10
and
when
they
came
thither
to
the
hill
behold
a
company
of
prophets
met
him
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
him
and
he
prophesied
among
them
10
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
that
knew
him
beforetime
saw
that
behold
he
prophesied
among
the
prophets
then
the
people
said
one
to
another
what
is
this
that
is
come
unto
the
son
of
kish
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
10
12
and
one
of
the
same
place
answered
and
said
but
who
is
their
father
therefore
it
became
a
proverb
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
10
13
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
he
came
to
the
high
place
10
14
and
saul’s
uncle
said
unto
him
and
to
his
servant
whither
went
ye
and
he
said
to
seek
the
asses
and
when
we
saw
that
they
were
no
where
we
came
to
samuel
10
15
and
saul’s
uncle
said
tell
me
i
pray
thee
what
samuel
said
unto
you
10
16
and
saul
said
unto
his
uncle
he
told
us
plainly
that
the
asses
were
found
but
of
the
matter
of
the
kingdom
whereof
samuel
spake
he
told
him
not
10
17
and
samuel
called
the
people
together
unto
the
lord
to
mizpeh
10
18
and
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
brought
up
israel
out
of
egypt
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
kingdoms
and
of
them
that
oppressed
you
10
19
and
ye
have
this
day
rejected
your
god
who
himself
saved
you
out
of
all
your
adversities
and
your
tribulations
and
ye
have
said
unto
him
nay
but
set
a
king
over
us
now
therefore
present
yourselves
before
the
lord
by
your
tribes
and
by
your
thousands
10
20
and
when
samuel
had
caused
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
come
near
the
tribe
of
benjamin
was
taken
10
21
when
he
had
caused
the
tribe
of
benjamin
to
come
near
by
their
families
the
family
of
matri
was
taken
and
saul
the
son
of
kish
was
taken
and
when
they
sought
him
he
could
not
be
found
10
22
therefore
they
enquired
of
the
lord
further
if
the
man
should
yet
come
thither
and
the
lord
answered
behold
he
hath
hid
himself
among
the
stuff
10
23
and
they
ran
and
fetched
him
thence
and
when
he
stood
among
the
people
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
10
24
and
samuel
said
to
all
the
people
see
ye
him
whom
the
lord
hath
chosen
that
there
is
none
like
him
among
all
the
people
and
all
the
people
shouted
and
said
god
save
the
king
10
25
then
samuel
told
the
people
the
manner
of
the
kingdom
and
wrote
it
in
a
book
and
laid
it
up
before
the
lord
and
samuel
sent
all
the
people
away
every
man
to
his
house
10
26
and
saul
also
went
home
to
gibeah
and
there
went
with
him
a
band
of
men
whose
hearts
god
had
touched
10
27
but
the
children
of
belial
said
how
shall
this
man
save
us
and
they
despised
him
and
brought
no
presents
but
he
held
his
peace
11
1
then
nahash
the
ammonite
came
up
and
encamped
against
jabeshgilead
and
all
the
men
of
jabesh
said
unto
nahash
make
a
covenant
with
us
and
we
will
serve
thee
11
2
and
nahash
the
ammonite
answered
them
on
this
condition
will
i
make
a
covenant
with
you
that
i
may
thrust
out
all
your
right
eyes
and
lay
it
for
a
reproach
upon
all
israel
11
3
and
the
elders
of
jabesh
said
unto
him
give
us
seven
days’
respite
that
we
may
send
messengers
unto
all
the
coasts
of
israel
and
then
if
there
be
no
man
to
save
us
we
will
come
out
to
thee
11
4
then
came
the
messengers
to
gibeah
of
saul
and
told
the
tidings
in
the
ears
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
11
5
and
behold
saul
came
after
the
herd
out
of
the
field
and
saul
said
what
aileth
the
people
that
they
weep
and
they
told
him
the
tidings
of
the
men
of
jabesh
11
6
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
saul
when
he
heard
those
tidings
and
his
anger
was
kindled
greatly
11
7
and
he
took
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
hewed
them
in
pieces
and
sent
them
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
by
the
hands
of
messengers
saying
whosoever
cometh
not
forth
after
saul
and
after
samuel
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
his
oxen
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
fell
on
the
people
and
they
came
out
with
one
consent
11
8
and
when
he
numbered
them
in
bezek
the
children
of
israel
were
three
hundred
thousand
and
the
men
of
judah
thirty
thousand
11
9
and
they
said
unto
the
messengers
that
came
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
to
morrow
by
that
time
the
sun
be
hot
ye
shall
have
help
and
the
messengers
came
and
shewed
it
to
the
men
of
jabesh
and
they
were
glad
11
10
therefore
the
men
of
jabesh
said
to
morrow
we
will
come
out
unto
you
and
ye
shall
do
with
us
all
that
seemeth
good
unto
you
11
11
and
it
was
so
on
the
morrow
that
saul
put
the
people
in
three
companies
and
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
host
in
the
morning
watch
and
slew
the
ammonites
until
the
heat
of
the
day
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
which
remained
were
scattered
so
that
two
of
them
were
not
left
together
11
12
and
the
people
said
unto
samuel
who
is
he
that
said
shall
saul
reign
over
us
bring
the
men
that
we
may
put
them
to
death
11
13
and
saul
said
there
shall
not
a
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
for
to
day
the
lord
hath
wrought
salvation
in
israel
11
14
then
said
samuel
to
the
people
come
and
let
us
go
to
gilgal
and
renew
the
kingdom
there
11
15
and
all
the
people
went
to
gilgal
and
there
they
made
saul
king
before
the
lord
in
gilgal
and
there
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
and
there
saul
and
all
the
men
of
israel
rejoiced
greatly
12
1
and
samuel
said
unto
all
israel
behold
i
have
hearkened
unto
your
voice
in
all
that
ye
said
unto
me
and
have
made
a
king
over
you
12
2
and
now
behold
the
king
walketh
before
you
and
i
am
old
and
grayheaded
and
behold
my
sons
are
with
you
and
i
have
walked
before
you
from
my
childhood
unto
this
day
12
3
behold
here
i
am
witness
against
me
before
the
lord
and
before
his
anointed
whose
ox
have
i
taken
or
whose
ass
have
i
taken
or
whom
have
i
defrauded
whom
have
i
oppressed
or
of
whose
hand
have
i
received
any
bribe
to
blind
mine
eyes
therewith
and
i
will
restore
it
you
12
4
and
they
said
thou
hast
not
defrauded
us
nor
oppressed
us
neither
hast
thou
taken
ought
of
any
man’s
hand
12
5
and
he
said
unto
them
the
lord
is
witness
against
you
and
his
anointed
is
witness
this
day
that
ye
have
not
found
ought
in
my
hand
and
they
answered
he
is
witness
12
6
and
samuel
said
unto
the
people
it
is
the
lord
that
advanced
moses
and
aaron
and
that
brought
your
fathers
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
12
7
now
therefore
stand
still
that
i
may
reason
with
you
before
the
lord
of
all
the
righteous
acts
of
the
lord
which
he
did
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
12
8
when
jacob
was
come
into
egypt
and
your
fathers
cried
unto
the
lord
then
the
lord
sent
moses
and
aaron
which
brought
forth
your
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
made
them
dwell
in
this
place
12
9
and
when
they
forgat
the
lord
their
god
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
sisera
captain
of
the
host
of
hazor
and
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
moab
and
they
fought
against
them
12
10
and
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
we
have
sinned
because
we
have
forsaken
the
lord
and
have
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
but
now
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
and
we
will
serve
thee
12
11
and
the
lord
sent
jerubbaal
and
bedan
and
jephthah
and
samuel
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
your
enemies
on
every
side
and
ye
dwelled
safe
12
12
and
when
ye
saw
that
nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
came
against
you
ye
said
unto
me
nay
but
a
king
shall
reign
over
us
when
the
lord
your
god
was
your
king
12
13
now
therefore
behold
the
king
whom
ye
have
chosen
and
whom
ye
have
desired
and
behold
the
lord
hath
set
a
king
over
you
12
14
if
ye
will
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
and
obey
his
voice
and
not
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
then
shall
both
ye
and
also
the
king
that
reigneth
over
you
continue
following
the
lord
your
god
12
15
but
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
but
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
then
shall
the
hand
of
the
lord
be
against
you
as
it
was
against
your
fathers
12
16
now
therefore
stand
and
see
this
great
thing
which
the
lord
will
do
before
your
eyes
12
17
is
it
not
wheat
harvest
to
day
i
will
call
unto
the
lord
and
he
shall
send
thunder
and
rain
that
ye
may
perceive
and
see
that
your
wickedness
is
great
which
ye
have
done
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
asking
you
a
king
12
18
so
samuel
called
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
sent
thunder
and
rain
that
day
and
all
the
people
greatly
feared
the
lord
and
samuel
12
19
and
all
the
people
said
unto
samuel
pray
for
thy
servants
unto
the
lord
thy
god
that
we
die
not
for
we
have
added
unto
all
our
sins
this
evil
to
ask
us
a
king
12
20
and
samuel
said
unto
the
people
fear
not
ye
have
done
all
this
wickedness
yet
turn
not
aside
from
following
the
lord
but
serve
the
lord
with
all
your
heart
12
21
and
turn
ye
not
aside
for
then
should
ye
go
after
vain
things
which
cannot
profit
nor
deliver
for
they
are
vain
12
22
for
the
lord
will
not
forsake
his
people
for
his
great
name’s
sake
because
it
hath
pleased
the
lord
to
make
you
his
people
12
23
moreover
as
for
me
god
forbid
that
i
should
sin
against
the
lord
in
ceasing
to
pray
for
you
but
i
will
teach
you
the
good
and
the
right
way
12
24
only
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
in
truth
with
all
your
heart
for
consider
how
great
things
he
hath
done
for
you
12
25
but
if
ye
shall
still
do
wickedly
ye
shall
be
consumed
both
ye
and
your
king
13
1
saul
reigned
one
year
and
when
he
had
reigned
two
years
over
israel
13
2
saul
chose
him
three
thousand
men
of
israel
whereof
two
thousand
were
with
saul
in
michmash
and
in
mount
bethel
and
a
thousand
were
with
jonathan
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
sent
every
man
to
his
tent
13
3
and
jonathan
smote
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
that
was
in
geba
and
the
philistines
heard
of
it
and
saul
blew
the
trumpet
throughout
all
the
land
saying
let
the
hebrews
hear
13
4
and
all
israel
heard
say
that
saul
had
smitten
a
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
that
israel
also
was
had
in
abomination
with
the
philistines
and
the
people
were
called
together
after
saul
to
gilgal
13
5
and
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
to
fight
with
israel
thirty
thousand
chariots
and
six
thousand
horsemen
and
people
as
the
sand
which
is
on
the
sea
shore
in
multitude
and
they
came
up
and
pitched
in
michmash
eastward
from
bethaven
13
6
when
the
men
of
israel
saw
that
they
were
in
a
strait
(for
the
people
were
distressed
)
then
the
people
did
hide
themselves
in
caves
and
in
thickets
and
in
rocks
and
in
high
places
and
in
pits
13
7
and
some
of
the
hebrews
went
over
jordan
to
the
land
of
gad
and
gilead
as
for
saul
he
was
yet
in
gilgal
and
all
the
people
followed
him
trembling
13
8
and
he
tarried
seven
days
according
to
the
set
time
that
samuel
had
appointed
but
samuel
came
not
to
gilgal
and
the
people
were
scattered
from
him
13
9
and
saul
said
bring
hither
a
burnt
offering
to
me
and
peace
offerings
and
he
offered
the
burnt
offering
13
10
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering
behold
samuel
came
and
saul
went
out
to
meet
him
that
he
might
salute
him
13
11
and
samuel
said
what
hast
thou
done
and
saul
said
because
i
saw
that
the
people
were
scattered
from
me
and
that
thou
camest
not
within
the
days
appointed
and
that
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
at
michmash
13
12
therefore
said
i
the
philistines
will
come
down
now
upon
me
to
gilgal
and
i
have
not
made
supplication
unto
the
lord
i
forced
myself
therefore
and
offered
a
burnt
offering
13
13
and
samuel
said
to
saul
thou
hast
done
foolishly
thou
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
of
the
lord
thy
god
which
he
commanded
thee
for
now
would
the
lord
have
established
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
13
14
but
now
thy
kingdom
shall
not
continue
the
lord
hath
sought
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
the
lord
hath
commanded
him
to
be
captain
over
his
people
because
thou
hast
not
kept
that
which
the
lord
commanded
thee
13
15
and
samuel
arose
and
gat
him
up
from
gilgal
unto
gibeah
of
benjamin
and
saul
numbered
the
people
that
were
present
with
him
about
six
hundred
men
13
16
and
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
and
the
people
that
were
present
with
them
abode
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
but
the
philistines
encamped
in
michmash
13
17
and
the
spoilers
came
out
of
the
camp
of
the
philistines
in
three
companies
one
company
turned
unto
the
way
that
leadeth
to
ophrah
unto
the
land
of
shual
13
18
and
another
company
turned
the
way
to
bethhoron
and
another
company
turned
to
the
way
of
the
border
that
looketh
to
the
valley
of
zeboim
toward
the
wilderness
13
19
now
there
was
no
smith
found
throughout
all
the
land
of
israel
for
the
philistines
said
lest
the
hebrews
make
them
swords
or
spears
13
20
but
all
the
israelites
went
down
to
the
philistines
to
sharpen
every
man
his
share
and
his
coulter
and
his
axe
and
his
mattock
13
21
yet
they
had
a
file
for
the
mattocks
and
for
the
coulters
and
for
the
forks
and
for
the
axes
and
to
sharpen
the
goads
13
22
so
it
came
to
pass
in
the
day
of
battle
that
there
was
neither
sword
nor
spear
found
in
the
hand
of
any
of
the
people
that
were
with
saul
and
jonathan
but
with
saul
and
with
jonathan
his
son
was
there
found
13
23
and
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
went
out
to
the
passage
of
michmash
14
1
now
it
came
to
pass
upon
a
day
that
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
said
unto
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour
come
and
let
us
go
over
to
the
philistines’
garrison
that
is
on
the
other
side
but
he
told
not
his
father
14
2
and
saul
tarried
in
the
uttermost
part
of
gibeah
under
a
pomegranate
tree
which
is
in
migron
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
were
about
six
hundred
men
14
3
and
ahiah
the
son
of
ahitub
ichabod’s
brother
the
son
of
phinehas
the
son
of
eli
the
lord’s
priest
in
shiloh
wearing
an
ephod
and
the
people
knew
not
that
jonathan
was
gone
14
4
and
between
the
passages
by
which
jonathan
sought
to
go
over
unto
the
philistines’
garrison
there
was
a
sharp
rock
on
the
one
side
and
a
sharp
rock
on
the
other
side
and
the
name
of
the
one
was
bozez
and
the
name
of
the
other
seneh
14
5
the
forefront
of
the
one
was
situate
northward
over
against
michmash
and
the
other
southward
over
against
gibeah
14
6
and
jonathan
said
to
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour
come
and
let
us
go
over
unto
the
garrison
of
these
uncircumcised
it
may
be
that
the
lord
will
work
for
us
for
there
is
no
restraint
to
the
lord
to
save
by
many
or
by
few
14
7
and
his
armourbearer
said
unto
him
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
turn
thee
behold
i
am
with
thee
according
to
thy
heart
14
8
then
said
jonathan
behold
we
will
pass
over
unto
these
men
and
we
will
discover
ourselves
unto
them
14
9
if
they
say
thus
unto
us
tarry
until
we
come
to
you
then
we
will
stand
still
in
our
place
and
will
not
go
up
unto
them
14
10
but
if
they
say
thus
come
up
unto
us
then
we
will
go
up
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hand
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
us
14
11
and
both
of
them
discovered
themselves
unto
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
said
behold
the
hebrews
come
forth
out
of
the
holes
where
they
had
hid
themselves
14
12
and
the
men
of
the
garrison
answered
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
and
said
come
up
to
us
and
we
will
shew
you
a
thing
and
jonathan
said
unto
his
armourbearer
come
up
after
me
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
14
13
and
jonathan
climbed
up
upon
his
hands
and
upon
his
feet
and
his
armourbearer
after
him
and
they
fell
before
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
slew
after
him
14
14
and
that
first
slaughter
which
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
made
was
about
twenty
men
within
as
it
were
an
half
acre
of
land
which
a
yoke
of
oxen
might
plow
14
15
and
there
was
trembling
in
the
host
in
the
field
and
among
all
the
people
the
garrison
and
the
spoilers
they
also
trembled
and
the
earth
quaked
so
it
was
a
very
great
trembling
14
16
and
the
watchmen
of
saul
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
looked
and
behold
the
multitude
melted
away
and
they
went
on
beating
down
one
another
14
17
then
said
saul
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
number
now
and
see
who
is
gone
from
us
and
when
they
had
numbered
behold
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
were
not
there
14
18
and
saul
said
unto
ahiah
bring
hither
the
ark
of
god
for
the
ark
of
god
was
at
that
time
with
the
children
of
israel
14
19
and
it
came
to
pass
while
saul
talked
unto
the
priest
that
the
noise
that
was
in
the
host
of
the
philistines
went
on
and
increased
and
saul
said
unto
the
priest
withdraw
thine
hand
14
20
and
saul
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
assembled
themselves
and
they
came
to
the
battle
and
behold
every
man’s
sword
was
against
his
fellow
and
there
was
a
very
great
discomfiture
14
21
moreover
the
hebrews
that
were
with
the
philistines
before
that
time
which
went
up
with
them
into
the
camp
from
the
country
round
about
even
they
also
turned
to
be
with
the
israelites
that
were
with
saul
and
jonathan
14
22
likewise
all
the
men
of
israel
which
had
hid
themselves
in
mount
ephraim
when
they
heard
that
the
philistines
fled
even
they
also
followed
hard
after
them
in
the
battle
14
23
so
the
lord
saved
israel
that
day
and
the
battle
passed
over
unto
bethaven
14
24
and
the
men
of
israel
were
distressed
that
day
for
saul
had
adjured
the
people
saying
cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
until
evening
that
i
may
be
avenged
on
mine
enemies
so
none
of
the
people
tasted
any
food
14
25
and
all
they
of
the
land
came
to
a
wood
and
there
was
honey
upon
the
ground
14
26
and
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
wood
behold
the
honey
dropped
but
no
man
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
for
the
people
feared
the
oath
14
27
but
jonathan
heard
not
when
his
father
charged
the
people
with
the
oath
wherefore
he
put
forth
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
his
hand
and
dipped
it
in
an
honeycomb
and
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
were
enlightened
14
28
then
answered
one
of
the
people
and
said
thy
father
straitly
charged
the
people
with
an
oath
saying
cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
this
day
and
the
people
were
faint
14
29
then
said
jonathan
my
father
hath
troubled
the
land
see
i
pray
you
how
mine
eyes
have
been
enlightened
because
i
tasted
a
little
of
this
honey
14
30
how
much
more
if
haply
the
people
had
eaten
freely
to
day
of
the
spoil
of
their
enemies
which
they
found
for
had
there
not
been
now
a
much
greater
slaughter
among
the
philistines
14
31
and
they
smote
the
philistines
that
day
from
michmash
to
aijalon
and
the
people
were
very
faint
14
32
and
the
people
flew
upon
the
spoil
and
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
calves
and
slew
them
on
the
ground
and
the
people
did
eat
them
with
the
blood
14
33
then
they
told
saul
saying
behold
the
people
sin
against
the
lord
in
that
they
eat
with
the
blood
and
he
said
ye
have
transgressed
roll
a
great
stone
unto
me
this
day
14
34
and
saul
said
disperse
yourselves
among
the
people
and
say
unto
them
bring
me
hither
every
man
his
ox
and
every
man
his
sheep
and
slay
them
here
and
eat
and
sin
not
against
the
lord
in
eating
with
the
blood
and
all
the
people
brought
every
man
his
ox
with
him
that
night
and
slew
them
there
14
35
and
saul
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
the
same
was
the
first
altar
that
he
built
unto
the
lord
14
36
and
saul
said
let
us
go
down
after
the
philistines
by
night
and
spoil
them
until
the
morning
light
and
let
us
not
leave
a
man
of
them
and
they
said
do
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee
then
said
the
priest
let
us
draw
near
hither
unto
god
14
37
and
saul
asked
counsel
of
god
shall
i
go
down
after
the
philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
but
he
answered
him
not
that
day
14
38
and
saul
said
draw
ye
near
hither
all
the
chief
of
the
people
and
know
and
see
wherein
this
sin
hath
been
this
day
14
39
for
as
the
lord
liveth
which
saveth
israel
though
it
be
in
jonathan
my
son
he
shall
surely
die
but
there
was
not
a
man
among
all
the
people
that
answered
him
14
40
then
said
he
unto
all
israel
be
ye
on
one
side
and
i
and
jonathan
my
son
will
be
on
the
other
side
and
the
people
said
unto
saul
do
what
seemeth
good
unto
thee
14
41
therefore
saul
said
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
give
a
perfect
lot
and
saul
and
jonathan
were
taken
but
the
people
escaped
14
42
and
saul
said
cast
lots
between
me
and
jonathan
my
son
and
jonathan
was
taken
14
43
then
saul
said
to
jonathan
tell
me
what
thou
hast
done
and
jonathan
told
him
and
said
i
did
but
taste
a
little
honey
with
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
mine
hand
and
lo
i
must
die
14
44
and
saul
answered
god
do
so
and
more
also
for
thou
shalt
surely
die
jonathan
14
45
and
the
people
said
unto
saul
shall
jonathan
die
who
hath
wrought
this
great
salvation
in
israel
god
forbid
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
his
head
fall
to
the
ground
for
he
hath
wrought
with
god
this
day
so
the
people
rescued
jonathan
that
he
died
not
14
46
then
saul
went
up
from
following
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
went
to
their
own
place
14
47
so
saul
took
the
kingdom
over
israel
and
fought
against
all
his
enemies
on
every
side
against
moab
and
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
against
edom
and
against
the
kings
of
zobah
and
against
the
philistines
and
whithersoever
he
turned
himself
he
vexed
them
14
48
and
he
gathered
an
host
and
smote
the
amalekites
and
delivered
israel
out
of
the
hands
of
them
that
spoiled
them
14
49
now
the
sons
of
saul
were
jonathan
and
ishui
and
melchishua
and
the
names
of
his
two
daughters
were
these
the
name
of
the
firstborn
merab
and
the
name
of
the
younger
michal
14
50
and
the
name
of
saul’s
wife
was
ahinoam
the
daughter
of
ahimaaz
and
the
name
of
the
captain
of
his
host
was
abner
the
son
of
ner
saul’s
uncle
14
51
and
kish
was
the
father
of
saul
and
ner
the
father
of
abner
was
the
son
of
abiel
14
52
and
there
was
sore
war
against
the
philistines
all
the
days
of
saul
and
when
saul
saw
any
strong
man
or
any
valiant
man
he
took
him
unto
him
15
1
samuel
also
said
unto
saul
the
lord
sent
me
to
anoint
thee
to
be
king
over
his
people
over
israel
now
therefore
hearken
thou
unto
the
voice
of
the
words
of
the
lord
15
2
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
remember
that
which
amalek
did
to
israel
how
he
laid
wait
for
him
in
the
way
when
he
came
up
from
egypt
15
3
now
go
and
smite
amalek
and
utterly
destroy
all
that
they
have
and
spare
them
not
but
slay
both
man
and
woman
infant
and
suckling
ox
and
sheep
camel
and
ass
15
4
and
saul
gathered
the
people
together
and
numbered
them
in
telaim
two
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
ten
thousand
men
of
judah
15
5
and
saul
came
to
a
city
of
amalek
and
laid
wait
in
the
valley
15
6
and
saul
said
unto
the
kenites
go
depart
get
you
down
from
among
the
amalekites
lest
i
destroy
you
with
them
for
ye
shewed
kindness
to
all
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
up
out
of
egypt
so
the
kenites
departed
from
among
the
amalekites
15
7
and
saul
smote
the
amalekites
from
havilah
until
thou
comest
to
shur
that
is
over
against
egypt
15
8
and
he
took
agag
the
king
of
the
amalekites
alive
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
15
9
but
saul
and
the
people
spared
agag
and
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
oxen
and
of
the
fatlings
and
the
lambs
and
all
that
was
good
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
them
but
every
thing
that
was
vile
and
refuse
that
they
destroyed
utterly
15
10
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
samuel
saying
15
11
it
repenteth
me
that
i
have
set
up
saul
to
be
king
for
he
is
turned
back
from
following
me
and
hath
not
performed
my
commandments
and
it
grieved
samuel
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
all
night
15
12
and
when
samuel
rose
early
to
meet
saul
in
the
morning
it
was
told
samuel
saying
saul
came
to
carmel
and
behold
he
set
him
up
a
place
and
is
gone
about
and
passed
on
and
gone
down
to
gilgal
15
13
and
samuel
came
to
saul
and
saul
said
unto
him
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
i
have
performed
the
commandment
of
the
lord
15
14
and
samuel
said
what
meaneth
then
this
bleating
of
the
sheep
in
mine
ears
and
the
lowing
of
the
oxen
which
i
hear
15
15
and
saul
said
they
have
brought
them
from
the
amalekites
for
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
oxen
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
rest
we
have
utterly
destroyed
15
16
then
samuel
said
unto
saul
stay
and
i
will
tell
thee
what
the
lord
hath
said
to
me
this
night
and
he
said
unto
him
say
on
15
17
and
samuel
said
when
thou
wast
little
in
thine
own
sight
wast
thou
not
made
the
head
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
the
lord
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
15
18
and
the
lord
sent
thee
on
a
journey
and
said
go
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
amalekites
and
fight
against
them
until
they
be
consumed
15
19
wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
but
didst
fly
upon
the
spoil
and
didst
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
15
20
and
saul
said
unto
samuel
yea
i
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
have
gone
the
way
which
the
lord
sent
me
and
have
brought
agag
the
king
of
amalek
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
amalekites
15
21
but
the
people
took
of
the
spoil
sheep
and
oxen
the
chief
of
the
things
which
should
have
been
utterly
destroyed
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
god
in
gilgal
15
22
and
samuel
said
hath
the
lord
as
great
delight
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
the
lord
behold
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
rams
15
23
for
rebellion
is
as
the
sin
of
witchcraft
and
stubbornness
is
as
iniquity
and
idolatry
because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
he
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
being
king
15
24
and
saul
said
unto
samuel
i
have
sinned
for
i
have
transgressed
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
thy
words
because
i
feared
the
people
and
obeyed
their
voice
15
25
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
pardon
my
sin
and
turn
again
with
me
that
i
may
worship
the
lord
15
26
and
samuel
said
unto
saul
i
will
not
return
with
thee
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
hath
rejected
thee
from
being
king
over
israel
15
27
and
as
samuel
turned
about
to
go
away
he
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
of
his
mantle
and
it
rent
15
28
and
samuel
said
unto
him
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
of
israel
from
thee
this
day
and
hath
given
it
to
a
neighbour
of
thine
that
is
better
than
thou
15
29
and
also
the
strength
of
israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent
for
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
repent
15
30
then
he
said
i
have
sinned
yet
honour
me
now
i
pray
thee
before
the
elders
of
my
people
and
before
israel
and
turn
again
with
me
that
i
may
worship
the
lord
thy
god
15
31
so
samuel
turned
again
after
saul
and
saul
worshipped
the
lord
15
32
then
said
samuel
bring
ye
hither
to
me
agag
the
king
of
the
amalekites
and
agag
came
unto
him
delicately
and
agag
said
surely
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past
15
33
and
samuel
said
as
the
sword
hath
made
women
childless
so
shall
thy
mother
be
childless
among
women
and
samuel
hewed
agag
in
pieces
before
the
lord
in
gilgal
15
34
then
samuel
went
to
ramah
and
saul
went
up
to
his
house
to
gibeah
of
saul
15
35
and
samuel
came
no
more
to
see
saul
until
the
day
of
his
death
nevertheless
samuel
mourned
for
saul
and
the
lord
repented
that
he
had
made
saul
king
over
israel
16
1
and
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
how
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
saul
seeing
i
have
rejected
him
from
reigning
over
israel
fill
thine
horn
with
oil
and
go
i
will
send
thee
to
jesse
the
bethlehemite
for
i
have
provided
me
a
king
among
his
sons
16
2
and
samuel
said
how
can
i
go
if
saul
hear
it
he
will
kill
me
and
the
lord
said
take
an
heifer
with
thee
and
say
i
am
come
to
sacrifice
to
the
lord
16
3
and
call
jesse
to
the
sacrifice
and
i
will
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
me
him
whom
i
name
unto
thee
16
4
and
samuel
did
that
which
the
lord
spake
and
came
to
bethlehem
and
the
elders
of
the
town
trembled
at
his
coming
and
said
comest
thou
peaceably
16
5
and
he
said
peaceably
i
am
come
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
sanctify
yourselves
and
come
with
me
to
the
sacrifice
and
he
sanctified
jesse
and
his
sons
and
called
them
to
the
sacrifice
16
6
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
that
he
looked
on
eliab
and
said
surely
the
lord’s
anointed
is
before
him
16
7
but
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
look
not
on
his
countenance
or
on
the
height
of
his
stature
because
i
have
refused
him
for
the
lord
seeth
not
as
man
seeth
for
man
looketh
on
the
outward
appearance
but
the
lord
looketh
on
the
heart
16
8
then
jesse
called
abinadab
and
made
him
pass
before
samuel
and
he
said
neither
hath
the
lord
chosen
this
16
9
then
jesse
made
shammah
to
pass
by
and
he
said
neither
hath
the
lord
chosen
this
16
10
again
jesse
made
seven
of
his
sons
to
pass
before
samuel
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
the
lord
hath
not
chosen
these
16
11
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
are
here
all
thy
children
and
he
said
there
remaineth
yet
the
youngest
and
behold
he
keepeth
the
sheep
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
send
and
fetch
him
for
we
will
not
sit
down
till
he
come
hither
16
12
and
he
sent
and
brought
him
in
now
he
was
ruddy
and
withal
of
a
beautiful
countenance
and
goodly
to
look
to
and
the
lord
said
arise
anoint
him
for
this
is
he
16
13
then
samuel
took
the
horn
of
oil
and
anointed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
brethren
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
david
from
that
day
forward
so
samuel
rose
up
and
went
to
ramah
16
14
but
the
spirit
of
the
lord
departed
from
saul
and
an
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
troubled
him
16
15
and
saul’s
servants
said
unto
him
behold
now
an
evil
spirit
from
god
troubleth
thee
16
16
let
our
lord
now
command
thy
servants
which
are
before
thee
to
seek
out
a
man
who
is
a
cunning
player
on
an
harp
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
god
is
upon
thee
that
he
shall
play
with
his
hand
and
thou
shalt
be
well
16
17
and
saul
said
unto
his
servants
provide
me
now
a
man
that
can
play
well
and
bring
him
to
me
16
18
then
answered
one
of
the
servants
and
said
behold
i
have
seen
a
son
of
jesse
the
bethlehemite
that
is
cunning
in
playing
and
a
mighty
valiant
man
and
a
man
of
war
and
prudent
in
matters
and
a
comely
person
and
the
lord
is
with
him
16
19
wherefore
saul
sent
messengers
unto
jesse
and
said
send
me
david
thy
son
which
is
with
the
sheep
16
20
and
jesse
took
an
ass
laden
with
bread
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
kid
and
sent
them
by
david
his
son
unto
saul
16
21
and
david
came
to
saul
and
stood
before
him
and
he
loved
him
greatly
and
he
became
his
armourbearer
16
22
and
saul
sent
to
jesse
saying
let
david
i
pray
thee
stand
before
me
for
he
hath
found
favour
in
my
sight
16
23
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
god
was
upon
saul
that
david
took
an
harp
and
played
with
his
hand
so
saul
was
refreshed
and
was
well
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
him
17
1
now
the
philistines
gathered
together
their
armies
to
battle
and
were
gathered
together
at
shochoh
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
pitched
between
shochoh
and
azekah
in
ephesdammim
17
2
and
saul
and
the
men
of
israel
were
gathered
together
and
pitched
by
the
valley
of
elah
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
the
philistines
17
3
and
the
philistines
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
one
side
and
israel
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
other
side
and
there
was
a
valley
between
them
17
4
and
there
went
out
a
champion
out
of
the
camp
of
the
philistines
named
goliath
of
gath
whose
height
was
six
cubits
and
a
span
17
5
and
he
had
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head
and
he
was
armed
with
a
coat
of
mail
and
the
weight
of
the
coat
was
five
thousand
shekels
of
brass
17
6
and
he
had
greaves
of
brass
upon
his
legs
and
a
target
of
brass
between
his
shoulders
17
7
and
the
staff
of
his
spear
was
like
a
weaver’s
beam
and
his
spear’s
head
weighed
six
hundred
shekels
of
iron
and
one
bearing
a
shield
went
before
him
17
8
and
he
stood
and
cried
unto
the
armies
of
israel
and
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
come
out
to
set
your
battle
in
array
am
not
i
a
philistine
and
ye
servants
to
saul
choose
you
a
man
for
you
and
let
him
come
down
to
me
17
9
if
he
be
able
to
fight
with
me
and
to
kill
me
then
will
we
be
your
servants
but
if
i
prevail
against
him
and
kill
him
then
shall
ye
be
our
servants
and
serve
us
17
10
and
the
philistine
said
i
defy
the
armies
of
israel
this
day
give
me
a
man
that
we
may
fight
together
17
11
when
saul
and
all
israel
heard
those
words
of
the
philistine
they
were
dismayed
and
greatly
afraid
17
12
now
david
was
the
son
of
that
ephrathite
of
bethlehemjudah
whose
name
was
jesse
and
he
had
eight
sons
and
the
man
went
among
men
for
an
old
man
in
the
days
of
saul
17
13
and
the
three
eldest
sons
of
jesse
went
and
followed
saul
to
the
battle
and
the
names
of
his
three
sons
that
went
to
the
battle
were
eliab
the
firstborn
and
next
unto
him
abinadab
and
the
third
shammah
17
14
and
david
was
the
youngest
and
the
three
eldest
followed
saul
17
15
but
david
went
and
returned
from
saul
to
feed
his
father’s
sheep
at
bethlehem
17
16
and
the
philistine
drew
near
morning
and
evening
and
presented
himself
forty
days
17
17
and
jesse
said
unto
david
his
son
take
now
for
thy
brethren
an
ephah
of
this
parched
corn
and
these
ten
loaves
and
run
to
the
camp
of
thy
brethren
17
18
and
carry
these
ten
cheeses
unto
the
captain
of
their
thousand
and
look
how
thy
brethren
fare
and
take
their
pledge
17
19
now
saul
and
they
and
all
the
men
of
israel
were
in
the
valley
of
elah
fighting
with
the
philistines
17
20
and
david
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
left
the
sheep
with
a
keeper
and
took
and
went
as
jesse
had
commanded
him
and
he
came
to
the
trench
as
the
host
was
going
forth
to
the
fight
and
shouted
for
the
battle
17
21
for
israel
and
the
philistines
had
put
the
battle
in
array
army
against
army
17
22
and
david
left
his
carriage
in
the
hand
of
the
keeper
of
the
carriage
and
ran
into
the
army
and
came
and
saluted
his
brethren
17
23
and
as
he
talked
with
them
behold
there
came
up
the
champion
the
philistine
of
gath
goliath
by
name
out
of
the
armies
of
the
philistines
and
spake
according
to
the
same
words
and
david
heard
them
17
24
and
all
the
men
of
israel
when
they
saw
the
man
fled
from
him
and
were
sore
afraid
17
25
and
the
men
of
israel
said
have
ye
seen
this
man
that
is
come
up
surely
to
defy
israel
is
he
come
up
and
it
shall
be
that
the
man
who
killeth
him
the
king
will
enrich
him
with
great
riches
and
will
give
him
his
daughter
and
make
his
father’s
house
free
in
israel
17
26
and
david
spake
to
the
men
that
stood
by
him
saying
what
shall
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
this
philistine
and
taketh
away
the
reproach
from
israel
for
who
is
this
uncircumcised
philistine
that
he
should
defy
the
armies
of
the
living
god
17
27
and
the
people
answered
him
after
this
manner
saying
so
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
him
17
28
and
eliab
his
eldest
brother
heard
when
he
spake
unto
the
men
and
eliab’s
anger
was
kindled
against
david
and
he
said
why
camest
thou
down
hither
and
with
whom
hast
thou
left
those
few
sheep
in
the
wilderness
i
know
thy
pride
and
the
naughtiness
of
thine
heart
for
thou
art
come
down
that
thou
mightest
see
the
battle
17
29
and
david
said
what
have
i
now
done
is
there
not
a
cause
17
30
and
he
turned
from
him
toward
another
and
spake
after
the
same
manner
and
the
people
answered
him
again
after
the
former
manner
17
31
and
when
the
words
were
heard
which
david
spake
they
rehearsed
them
before
saul
and
he
sent
for
him
17
32
and
david
said
to
saul
let
no
man’s
heart
fail
because
of
him
thy
servant
will
go
and
fight
with
this
philistine
17
33
and
saul
said
to
david
thou
art
not
able
to
go
against
this
philistine
to
fight
with
him
for
thou
art
but
a
youth
and
he
a
man
of
war
from
his
youth
17
34
and
david
said
unto
saul
thy
servant
kept
his
father’s
sheep
and
there
came
a
lion
and
a
bear
and
took
a
lamb
out
of
the
flock
17
35
and
i
went
out
after
him
and
smote
him
and
delivered
it
out
of
his
mouth
and
when
he
arose
against
me
i
caught
him
by
his
beard
and
smote
him
and
slew
him
17
36
thy
servant
slew
both
the
lion
and
the
bear
and
this
uncircumcised
philistine
shall
be
as
one
of
them
seeing
he
hath
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
god
17
37
david
said
moreover
the
lord
that
delivered
me
out
of
the
paw
of
the
lion
and
out
of
the
paw
of
the
bear
he
will
deliver
me
out
of
the
hand
of
this
philistine
and
saul
said
unto
david
go
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
17
38
and
saul
armed
david
with
his
armour
and
he
put
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head
also
he
armed
him
with
a
coat
of
mail
17
39
and
david
girded
his
sword
upon
his
armour
and
he
assayed
to
go
for
he
had
not
proved
it
and
david
said
unto
saul
i
cannot
go
with
these
for
i
have
not
proved
them
and
david
put
them
off
him
17
40
and
he
took
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
chose
him
five
smooth
stones
out
of
the
brook
and
put
them
in
a
shepherd’s
bag
which
he
had
even
in
a
scrip
and
his
sling
was
in
his
hand
and
he
drew
near
to
the
philistine
17
41
and
the
philistine
came
on
and
drew
near
unto
david
and
the
man
that
bare
the
shield
went
before
him
17
42
and
when
the
philistine
looked
about
and
saw
david
he
disdained
him
for
he
was
but
a
youth
and
ruddy
and
of
a
fair
countenance
17
43
and
the
philistine
said
unto
david
am
i
a
dog
that
thou
comest
to
me
with
staves
and
the
philistine
cursed
david
by
his
gods
17
44
and
the
philistine
said
to
david
come
to
me
and
i
will
give
thy
flesh
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
17
45
then
said
david
to
the
philistine
thou
comest
to
me
with
a
sword
and
with
a
spear
and
with
a
shield
but
i
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
the
armies
of
israel
whom
thou
hast
defied
17
46
this
day
will
the
lord
deliver
thee
into
mine
hand
and
i
will
smite
thee
and
take
thine
head
from
thee
and
i
will
give
the
carcases
of
the
host
of
the
philistines
this
day
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
that
all
the
earth
may
know
that
there
is
a
god
in
israel
17
47
and
all
this
assembly
shall
know
that
the
lord
saveth
not
with
sword
and
spear
for
the
battle
is
the
lord’s
and
he
will
give
you
into
our
hands
17
48
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
philistine
arose
and
came
and
drew
nigh
to
meet
david
that
david
hastened
and
ran
toward
the
army
to
meet
the
philistine
17
49
and
david
put
his
hand
in
his
bag
and
took
thence
a
stone
and
slang
it
and
smote
the
philistine
in
his
forehead
that
the
stone
sunk
into
his
forehead
and
he
fell
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
17
50
so
david
prevailed
over
the
philistine
with
a
sling
and
with
a
stone
and
smote
the
philistine
and
slew
him
but
there
was
no
sword
in
the
hand
of
david
17
51
therefore
david
ran
and
stood
upon
the
philistine
and
took
his
sword
and
drew
it
out
of
the
sheath
thereof
and
slew
him
and
cut
off
his
head
therewith
and
when
the
philistines
saw
their
champion
was
dead
they
fled
17
52
and
the
men
of
israel
and
of
judah
arose
and
shouted
and
pursued
the
philistines
until
thou
come
to
the
valley
and
to
the
gates
of
ekron
and
the
wounded
of
the
philistines
fell
down
by
the
way
to
shaaraim
even
unto
gath
and
unto
ekron
17
53
and
the
children
of
israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
philistines
and
they
spoiled
their
tents
17
54
and
david
took
the
head
of
the
philistine
and
brought
it
to
jerusalem
but
he
put
his
armour
in
his
tent
17
55
and
when
saul
saw
david
go
forth
against
the
philistine
he
said
unto
abner
the
captain
of
the
host
abner
whose
son
is
this
youth
and
abner
said
as
thy
soul
liveth
o
king
i
cannot
tell
17
56
and
the
king
said
enquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
is
17
57
and
as
david
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
philistine
abner
took
him
and
brought
him
before
saul
with
the
head
of
the
philistine
in
his
hand
17
58
and
saul
said
to
him
whose
son
art
thou
thou
young
man
and
david
answered
i
am
the
son
of
thy
servant
jesse
the
bethlehemite
18
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
saul
that
the
soul
of
jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
of
david
and
jonathan
loved
him
as
his
own
soul
18
2
and
saul
took
him
that
day
and
would
let
him
go
no
more
home
to
his
father’s
house
18
3
then
jonathan
and
david
made
a
covenant
because
he
loved
him
as
his
own
soul
18
4
and
jonathan
stripped
himself
of
the
robe
that
was
upon
him
and
gave
it
to
david
and
his
garments
even
to
his
sword
and
to
his
bow
and
to
his
girdle
18
5
and
david
went
out
whithersoever
saul
sent
him
and
behaved
himself
wisely
and
saul
set
him
over
the
men
of
war
and
he
was
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
and
also
in
the
sight
of
saul’s
servants
18
6
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
came
when
david
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
philistine
that
the
women
came
out
of
all
cities
of
israel
singing
and
dancing
to
meet
king
saul
with
tabrets
with
joy
and
with
instruments
of
musick
18
7
and
the
women
answered
one
another
as
they
played
and
said
saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
18
8
and
saul
was
very
wroth
and
the
saying
displeased
him
and
he
said
they
have
ascribed
unto
david
ten
thousands
and
to
me
they
have
ascribed
but
thousands
and
what
can
he
have
more
but
the
kingdom
18
9
and
saul
eyed
david
from
that
day
and
forward
18
10
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
evil
spirit
from
god
came
upon
saul
and
he
prophesied
in
the
midst
of
the
house
and
david
played
with
his
hand
as
at
other
times
and
there
was
a
javelin
in
saul’s
hand
18
11
and
saul
cast
the
javelin
for
he
said
i
will
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
with
it
and
david
avoided
out
of
his
presence
twice
18
12
and
saul
was
afraid
of
david
because
the
lord
was
with
him
and
was
departed
from
saul
18
13
therefore
saul
removed
him
from
him
and
made
him
his
captain
over
a
thousand
and
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
the
people
18
14
and
david
behaved
himself
wisely
in
all
his
ways
and
the
lord
was
with
him
18
15
wherefore
when
saul
saw
that
he
behaved
himself
very
wisely
he
was
afraid
of
him
18
16
but
all
israel
and
judah
loved
david
because
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
them
18
17
and
saul
said
to
david
behold
my
elder
daughter
merab
her
will
i
give
thee
to
wife
only
be
thou
valiant
for
me
and
fight
the
lord’s
battles
for
saul
said
let
not
mine
hand
be
upon
him
but
let
the
hand
of
the
philistines
be
upon
him
18
18
and
david
said
unto
saul
who
am
i
and
what
is
my
life
or
my
father’s
family
in
israel
that
i
should
be
son
in
law
to
the
king
18
19
but
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
when
merab
saul’s
daughter
should
have
been
given
to
david
that
she
was
given
unto
adriel
the
meholathite
to
wife
18
20
and
michal
saul’s
daughter
loved
david
and
they
told
saul
and
the
thing
pleased
him
18
21
and
saul
said
i
will
give
him
her
that
she
may
be
a
snare
to
him
and
that
the
hand
of
the
philistines
may
be
against
him
wherefore
saul
said
to
david
thou
shalt
this
day
be
my
son
in
law
in
the
one
of
the
twain
18
22
and
saul
commanded
his
servants
saying
commune
with
david
secretly
and
say
behold
the
king
hath
delight
in
thee
and
all
his
servants
love
thee
now
therefore
be
the
king’s
son
in
law
18
23
and
saul’s
servants
spake
those
words
in
the
ears
of
david
and
david
said
seemeth
it
to
you
a
light
thing
to
be
a
king’s
son
in
law
seeing
that
i
am
a
poor
man
and
lightly
esteemed
18
24
and
the
servants
of
saul
told
him
saying
on
this
manner
spake
david
18
25
and
saul
said
thus
shall
ye
say
to
david
the
king
desireth
not
any
dowry
but
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
philistines
to
be
avenged
of
the
king’s
enemies
but
saul
thought
to
make
david
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
philistines
18
26
and
when
his
servants
told
david
these
words
it
pleased
david
well
to
be
the
king’s
son
in
law
and
the
days
were
not
expired
18
27
wherefore
david
arose
and
went
he
and
his
men
and
slew
of
the
philistines
two
hundred
men
and
david
brought
their
foreskins
and
they
gave
them
in
full
tale
to
the
king
that
he
might
be
the
king’s
son
in
law
and
saul
gave
him
michal
his
daughter
to
wife
18
28
and
saul
saw
and
knew
that
the
lord
was
with
david
and
that
michal
saul’s
daughter
loved
him
18
29
and
saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
of
david
and
saul
became
david’s
enemy
continually
18
30
then
the
princes
of
the
philistines
went
forth
and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
went
forth
that
david
behaved
himself
more
wisely
than
all
the
servants
of
saul
so
that
his
name
was
much
set
by
19
1
and
saul
spake
to
jonathan
his
son
and
to
all
his
servants
that
they
should
kill
david
19
2
but
jonathan
saul’s
son
delighted
much
in
david
and
jonathan
told
david
saying
saul
my
father
seeketh
to
kill
thee
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
take
heed
to
thyself
until
the
morning
and
abide
in
a
secret
place
and
hide
thyself
19
3
and
i
will
go
out
and
stand
beside
my
father
in
the
field
where
thou
art
and
i
will
commune
with
my
father
of
thee
and
what
i
see
that
i
will
tell
thee
19
4
and
jonathan
spake
good
of
david
unto
saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
servant
against
david
because
he
hath
not
sinned
against
thee
and
because
his
works
have
been
to
thee-ward
very
good
19
5
for
he
did
put
his
life
in
his
hand
and
slew
the
philistine
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
salvation
for
all
israel
thou
sawest
it
and
didst
rejoice
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
blood
to
slay
david
without
a
cause
19
6
and
saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
jonathan
and
saul
sware
as
the
lord
liveth
he
shall
not
be
slain
19
7
and
jonathan
called
david
and
jonathan
shewed
him
all
those
things
and
jonathan
brought
david
to
saul
and
he
was
in
his
presence
as
in
times
past
19
8
and
there
was
war
again
and
david
went
out
and
fought
with
the
philistines
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
and
they
fled
from
him
19
9
and
the
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
was
upon
saul
as
he
sat
in
his
house
with
his
javelin
in
his
hand
and
david
played
with
his
hand
19
10
and
saul
sought
to
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
with
the
javelin
but
he
slipped
away
out
of
saul’s
presence
and
he
smote
the
javelin
into
the
wall
and
david
fled
and
escaped
that
night
19
11
saul
also
sent
messengers
unto
david’s
house
to
watch
him
and
to
slay
him
in
the
morning
and
michal
david’s
wife
told
him
saying
if
thou
save
not
thy
life
to
night
to
morrow
thou
shalt
be
slain
19
12
so
michal
let
david
down
through
a
window
and
he
went
and
fled
and
escaped
19
13
and
michal
took
an
image
and
laid
it
in
the
bed
and
put
a
pillow
of
goats’
hair
for
his
bolster
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth
19
14
and
when
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
david
she
said
he
is
sick
19
15
and
saul
sent
the
messengers
again
to
see
david
saying
bring
him
up
to
me
in
the
bed
that
i
may
slay
him
19
16
and
when
the
messengers
were
come
in
behold
there
was
an
image
in
the
bed
with
a
pillow
of
goats’
hair
for
his
bolster
19
17
and
saul
said
unto
michal
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
so
and
sent
away
mine
enemy
that
he
is
escaped
and
michal
answered
saul
he
said
unto
me
let
me
go
why
should
i
kill
thee
19
18
so
david
fled
and
escaped
and
came
to
samuel
to
ramah
and
told
him
all
that
saul
had
done
to
him
and
he
and
samuel
went
and
dwelt
in
naioth
19
19
and
it
was
told
saul
saying
behold
david
is
at
naioth
in
ramah
19
20
and
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
david
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
prophesying
and
samuel
standing
as
appointed
over
them
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
the
messengers
of
saul
and
they
also
prophesied
19
21
and
when
it
was
told
saul
he
sent
other
messengers
and
they
prophesied
likewise
and
saul
sent
messengers
again
the
third
time
and
they
prophesied
also
19
22
then
went
he
also
to
ramah
and
came
to
a
great
well
that
is
in
sechu
and
he
asked
and
said
where
are
samuel
and
david
and
one
said
behold
they
be
at
naioth
in
ramah
19
23
and
he
went
thither
to
naioth
in
ramah
and
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
him
also
and
he
went
on
and
prophesied
until
he
came
to
naioth
in
ramah
19
24
and
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
also
and
prophesied
before
samuel
in
like
manner
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
wherefore
they
say
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
20
1
and
david
fled
from
naioth
in
ramah
and
came
and
said
before
jonathan
what
have
i
done
what
is
mine
iniquity
and
what
is
my
sin
before
thy
father
that
he
seeketh
my
life
20
2
and
he
said
unto
him
god
forbid
thou
shalt
not
die
behold
my
father
will
do
nothing
either
great
or
small
but
that
he
will
shew
it
me
and
why
should
my
father
hide
this
thing
from
me
it
is
not
so
20
3
and
david
sware
moreover
and
said
thy
father
certainly
knoweth
that
i
have
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
and
he
saith
let
not
jonathan
know
this
lest
he
be
grieved
but
truly
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
there
is
but
a
step
between
me
and
death
20
4
then
said
jonathan
unto
david
whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth
i
will
even
do
it
for
thee
20
5
and
david
said
unto
jonathan
behold
to
morrow
is
the
new
moon
and
i
should
not
fail
to
sit
with
the
king
at
meat
but
let
me
go
that
i
may
hide
myself
in
the
field
unto
the
third
day
at
even
20
6
if
thy
father
at
all
miss
me
then
say
david
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
that
he
might
run
to
bethlehem
his
city
for
there
is
a
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
family
20
7
if
he
say
thus
it
is
well
thy
servant
shall
have
peace
but
if
he
be
very
wroth
then
be
sure
that
evil
is
determined
by
him
20
8
therefore
thou
shalt
deal
kindly
with
thy
servant
for
thou
hast
brought
thy
servant
into
a
covenant
of
the
lord
with
thee
notwithstanding
if
there
be
in
me
iniquity
slay
me
thyself
for
why
shouldest
thou
bring
me
to
thy
father
20
9
and
jonathan
said
far
be
it
from
thee
for
if
i
knew
certainly
that
evil
were
determined
by
my
father
to
come
upon
thee
then
would
not
i
tell
it
thee
20
10
then
said
david
to
jonathan
who
shall
tell
me
or
what
if
thy
father
answer
thee
roughly
20
11
and
jonathan
said
unto
david
come
and
let
us
go
out
into
the
field
and
they
went
out
both
of
them
into
the
field
20
12
and
jonathan
said
unto
david
o
lord
god
of
israel
when
i
have
sounded
my
father
about
to
morrow
any
time
or
the
third
day
and
behold
if
there
be
good
toward
david
and
i
then
send
not
unto
thee
and
shew
it
thee
20
13
the
lord
do
so
and
much
more
to
jonathan
but
if
it
please
my
father
to
do
thee
evil
then
i
will
shew
it
thee
and
send
thee
away
that
thou
mayest
go
in
peace
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
as
he
hath
been
with
my
father
20
14
and
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
i
live
shew
me
the
kindness
of
the
lord
that
i
die
not
20
15
but
also
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
my
house
for
ever
no
not
when
the
lord
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
of
david
every
one
from
the
face
of
the
earth
20
16
so
jonathan
made
a
covenant
with
the
house
of
david
saying
let
the
lord
even
require
it
at
the
hand
of
david’s
enemies
20
17
and
jonathan
caused
david
to
swear
again
because
he
loved
him
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
own
soul
20
18
then
jonathan
said
to
david
to
morrow
is
the
new
moon
and
thou
shalt
be
missed
because
thy
seat
will
be
empty
20
19
and
when
thou
hast
stayed
three
days
then
thou
shalt
go
down
quickly
and
come
to
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
in
hand
and
shalt
remain
by
the
stone
ezel
20
20
and
i
will
shoot
three
arrows
on
the
side
thereof
as
though
i
shot
at
a
mark
20
21
and
behold
i
will
send
a
lad
saying
go
find
out
the
arrows
if
i
expressly
say
unto
the
lad
behold
the
arrows
are
on
this
side
of
thee
take
them
then
come
thou
for
there
is
peace
to
thee
and
no
hurt
as
the
lord
liveth
20
22
but
if
i
say
thus
unto
the
young
man
behold
the
arrows
are
beyond
thee
go
thy
way
for
the
lord
hath
sent
thee
away
20
23
and
as
touching
the
matter
which
thou
and
i
have
spoken
of
behold
the
lord
be
between
thee
and
me
for
ever
20
24
so
david
hid
himself
in
the
field
and
when
the
new
moon
was
come
the
king
sat
him
down
to
eat
meat
20
25
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
seat
as
at
other
times
even
upon
a
seat
by
the
wall
and
jonathan
arose
and
abner
sat
by
saul’s
side
and
david’s
place
was
empty
20
26
nevertheless
saul
spake
not
any
thing
that
day
for
he
thought
something
hath
befallen
him
he
is
not
clean
surely
he
is
not
clean
20
27
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
which
was
the
second
day
of
the
month
that
david’s
place
was
empty
and
saul
said
unto
jonathan
his
son
wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
of
jesse
to
meat
neither
yesterday
nor
to
day
20
28
and
jonathan
answered
saul
david
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
to
go
to
bethlehem
20
29
and
he
said
let
me
go
i
pray
thee
for
our
family
hath
a
sacrifice
in
the
city
and
my
brother
he
hath
commanded
me
to
be
there
and
now
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thine
eyes
let
me
get
away
i
pray
thee
and
see
my
brethren
therefore
he
cometh
not
unto
the
king’s
table
20
30
then
saul’s
anger
was
kindled
against
jonathan
and
he
said
unto
him
thou
son
of
the
perverse
rebellious
woman
do
not
i
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
of
jesse
to
thine
own
confusion
and
unto
the
confusion
of
thy
mother’s
nakedness
20
31
for
as
long
as
the
son
of
jesse
liveth
upon
the
ground
thou
shalt
not
be
established
nor
thy
kingdom
wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
me
for
he
shall
surely
die
20
32
and
jonathan
answered
saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
wherefore
shall
he
be
slain
what
hath
he
done
20
33
and
saul
cast
a
javelin
at
him
to
smite
him
whereby
jonathan
knew
that
it
was
determined
of
his
father
to
slay
david
20
34
so
jonathan
arose
from
the
table
in
fierce
anger
and
did
eat
no
meat
the
second
day
of
the
month
for
he
was
grieved
for
david
because
his
father
had
done
him
shame
20
35
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
at
the
time
appointed
with
david
and
a
little
lad
with
him
20
36
and
he
said
unto
his
lad
run
find
out
now
the
arrows
which
i
shoot
and
as
the
lad
ran
he
shot
an
arrow
beyond
him
20
37
and
when
the
lad
was
come
to
the
place
of
the
arrow
which
jonathan
had
shot
jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
and
said
is
not
the
arrow
beyond
thee
20
38
and
jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
make
speed
haste
stay
not
and
jonathan’s
lad
gathered
up
the
arrows
and
came
to
his
master
20
39
but
the
lad
knew
not
any
thing
only
jonathan
and
david
knew
the
matter
20
40
and
jonathan
gave
his
artillery
unto
his
lad
and
said
unto
him
go
carry
them
to
the
city
20
41
and
as
soon
as
the
lad
was
gone
david
arose
out
of
a
place
toward
the
south
and
fell
on
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
three
times
and
they
kissed
one
another
and
wept
one
with
another
until
david
exceeded
20
42
and
jonathan
said
to
david
go
in
peace
forasmuch
as
we
have
sworn
both
of
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
saying
the
lord
be
between
me
and
thee
and
between
my
seed
and
thy
seed
for
ever
and
he
arose
and
departed
and
jonathan
went
into
the
city
21
1
then
came
david
to
nob
to
ahimelech
the
priest
and
ahimelech
was
afraid
at
the
meeting
of
david
and
said
unto
him
why
art
thou
alone
and
no
man
with
thee
21
2
and
david
said
unto
ahimelech
the
priest
the
king
hath
commanded
me
a
business
and
hath
said
unto
me
let
no
man
know
any
thing
of
the
business
whereabout
i
send
thee
and
what
i
have
commanded
thee
and
i
have
appointed
my
servants
to
such
and
such
a
place
21
3
now
therefore
what
is
under
thine
hand
give
me
five
loaves
of
bread
in
mine
hand
or
what
there
is
present
21
4
and
the
priest
answered
david
and
said
there
is
no
common
bread
under
mine
hand
but
there
is
hallowed
bread
if
the
young
men
have
kept
themselves
at
least
from
women
21
5
and
david
answered
the
priest
and
said
unto
him
of
a
truth
women
have
been
kept
from
us
about
these
three
days
since
i
came
out
and
the
vessels
of
the
young
men
are
holy
and
the
bread
is
in
a
manner
common
yea
though
it
were
sanctified
this
day
in
the
vessel
21
6
so
the
priest
gave
him
hallowed
bread
for
there
was
no
bread
there
but
the
shewbread
that
was
taken
from
before
the
lord
to
put
hot
bread
in
the
day
when
it
was
taken
away
21
7
now
a
certain
man
of
the
servants
of
saul
was
there
that
day
detained
before
the
lord
and
his
name
was
doeg
an
edomite
the
chiefest
of
the
herdmen
that
belonged
to
saul
21
8
and
david
said
unto
ahimelech
and
is
there
not
here
under
thine
hand
spear
or
sword
for
i
have
neither
brought
my
sword
nor
my
weapons
with
me
because
the
king’s
business
required
haste
21
9
and
the
priest
said
the
sword
of
goliath
the
philistine
whom
thou
slewest
in
the
valley
of
elah
behold
it
is
here
wrapped
in
a
cloth
behind
the
ephod
if
thou
wilt
take
that
take
it
for
there
is
no
other
save
that
here
and
david
said
there
is
none
like
that
give
it
me
21
10
and
david
arose
and
fled
that
day
for
fear
of
saul
and
went
to
achish
the
king
of
gath
21
11
and
the
servants
of
achish
said
unto
him
is
not
this
david
the
king
of
the
land
did
they
not
sing
one
to
another
of
him
in
dances
saying
saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
21
12
and
david
laid
up
these
words
in
his
heart
and
was
sore
afraid
of
achish
the
king
of
gath
21
13
and
he
changed
his
behaviour
before
them
and
feigned
himself
mad
in
their
hands
and
scrabbled
on
the
doors
of
the
gate
and
let
his
spittle
fall
down
upon
his
beard
21
14
then
said
achish
unto
his
servants
lo
ye
see
the
man
is
mad
wherefore
then
have
ye
brought
him
to
me
21
15
have
i
need
of
mad
men
that
ye
have
brought
this
fellow
to
play
the
mad
man
in
my
presence
shall
this
fellow
come
into
my
house
22
1
david
therefore
departed
thence
and
escaped
to
the
cave
adullam
and
when
his
brethren
and
all
his
father’s
house
heard
it
they
went
down
thither
to
him
22
2
and
every
one
that
was
in
distress
and
every
one
that
was
in
debt
and
every
one
that
was
discontented
gathered
themselves
unto
him
and
he
became
a
captain
over
them
and
there
were
with
him
about
four
hundred
men
22
3
and
david
went
thence
to
mizpeh
of
moab
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
moab
let
my
father
and
my
mother
i
pray
thee
come
forth
and
be
with
you
till
i
know
what
god
will
do
for
me
22
4
and
he
brought
them
before
the
king
of
moab
and
they
dwelt
with
him
all
the
while
that
david
was
in
the
hold
22
5
and
the
prophet
gad
said
unto
david
abide
not
in
the
hold
depart
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
judah
then
david
departed
and
came
into
the
forest
of
hareth
22
6
when
saul
heard
that
david
was
discovered
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
(now
saul
abode
in
gibeah
under
a
tree
in
ramah
having
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
about
him
)
22
7
then
saul
said
unto
his
servants
that
stood
about
him
hear
now
ye
benjamites
will
the
son
of
jesse
give
every
one
of
you
fields
and
vineyards
and
make
you
all
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
22
8
that
all
of
you
have
conspired
against
me
and
there
is
none
that
sheweth
me
that
my
son
hath
made
a
league
with
the
son
of
jesse
and
there
is
none
of
you
that
is
sorry
for
me
or
sheweth
unto
me
that
my
son
hath
stirred
up
my
servant
against
me
to
lie
in
wait
as
at
this
day
22
9
then
answered
doeg
the
edomite
which
was
set
over
the
servants
of
saul
and
said
i
saw
the
son
of
jesse
coming
to
nob
to
ahimelech
the
son
of
ahitub
22
10
and
he
enquired
of
the
lord
for
him
and
gave
him
victuals
and
gave
him
the
sword
of
goliath
the
philistine
22
11
then
the
king
sent
to
call
ahimelech
the
priest
the
son
of
ahitub
and
all
his
father’s
house
the
priests
that
were
in
nob
and
they
came
all
of
them
to
the
king
22
12
and
saul
said
hear
now
thou
son
of
ahitub
and
he
answered
here
i
am
my
lord
22
13
and
saul
said
unto
him
why
have
ye
conspired
against
me
thou
and
the
son
of
jesse
in
that
thou
hast
given
him
bread
and
a
sword
and
hast
enquired
of
god
for
him
that
he
should
rise
against
me
to
lie
in
wait
as
at
this
day
22
14
then
ahimelech
answered
the
king
and
said
and
who
is
so
faithful
among
all
thy
servants
as
david
which
is
the
king’s
son
in
law
and
goeth
at
thy
bidding
and
is
honourable
in
thine
house
22
15
did
i
then
begin
to
enquire
of
god
for
him
be
it
far
from
me
let
not
the
king
impute
any
thing
unto
his
servant
nor
to
all
the
house
of
my
father
for
thy
servant
knew
nothing
of
all
this
less
or
more
22
16
and
the
king
said
thou
shalt
surely
die
ahimelech
thou
and
all
thy
father’s
house
22
17
and
the
king
said
unto
the
footmen
that
stood
about
him
turn
and
slay
the
priests
of
the
lord
because
their
hand
also
is
with
david
and
because
they
knew
when
he
fled
and
did
not
shew
it
to
me
but
the
servants
of
the
king
would
not
put
forth
their
hand
to
fall
upon
the
priests
of
the
lord
22
18
and
the
king
said
to
doeg
turn
thou
and
fall
upon
the
priests
and
doeg
the
edomite
turned
and
he
fell
upon
the
priests
and
slew
on
that
day
fourscore
and
five
persons
that
did
wear
a
linen
ephod
22
19
and
nob
the
city
of
the
priests
smote
he
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
both
men
and
women
children
and
sucklings
and
oxen
and
asses
and
sheep
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
22
20
and
one
of
the
sons
of
ahimelech
the
son
of
ahitub
named
abiathar
escaped
and
fled
after
david
22
21
and
abiathar
shewed
david
that
saul
had
slain
the
lord’s
priests
22
22
and
david
said
unto
abiathar
i
knew
it
that
day
when
doeg
the
edomite
was
there
that
he
would
surely
tell
saul
i
have
occasioned
the
death
of
all
the
persons
of
thy
father’s
house
22
23
abide
thou
with
me
fear
not
for
he
that
seeketh
my
life
seeketh
thy
life
but
with
me
thou
shalt
be
in
safeguard
23
1
then
they
told
david
saying
behold
the
philistines
fight
against
keilah
and
they
rob
the
threshingfloors
23
2
therefore
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
and
smite
these
philistines
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
go
and
smite
the
philistines
and
save
keilah
23
3
and
david’s
men
said
unto
him
behold
we
be
afraid
here
in
judah
how
much
more
then
if
we
come
to
keilah
against
the
armies
of
the
philistines
23
4
then
david
enquired
of
the
lord
yet
again
and
the
lord
answered
him
and
said
arise
go
down
to
keilah
for
i
will
deliver
the
philistines
into
thine
hand
23
5
so
david
and
his
men
went
to
keilah
and
fought
with
the
philistines
and
brought
away
their
cattle
and
smote
them
with
a
great
slaughter
so
david
saved
the
inhabitants
of
keilah
23
6
and
it
came
to
pass
when
abiathar
the
son
of
ahimelech
fled
to
david
to
keilah
that
he
came
down
with
an
ephod
in
his
hand
23
7
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
come
to
keilah
and
saul
said
god
hath
delivered
him
into
mine
hand
for
he
is
shut
in
by
entering
into
a
town
that
hath
gates
and
bars
23
8
and
saul
called
all
the
people
together
to
war
to
go
down
to
keilah
to
besiege
david
and
his
men
23
9
and
david
knew
that
saul
secretly
practised
mischief
against
him
and
he
said
to
abiathar
the
priest
bring
hither
the
ephod
23
10
then
said
david
o
lord
god
of
israel
thy
servant
hath
certainly
heard
that
saul
seeketh
to
come
to
keilah
to
destroy
the
city
for
my
sake
23
11
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
up
into
his
hand
will
saul
come
down
as
thy
servant
hath
heard
o
lord
god
of
israel
i
beseech
thee
tell
thy
servant
and
the
lord
said
he
will
come
down
23
12
then
said
david
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
and
my
men
into
the
hand
of
saul
and
the
lord
said
they
will
deliver
thee
up
23
13
then
david
and
his
men
which
were
about
six
hundred
arose
and
departed
out
of
keilah
and
went
whithersoever
they
could
go
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
escaped
from
keilah
and
he
forbare
to
go
forth
23
14
and
david
abode
in
the
wilderness
in
strong
holds
and
remained
in
a
mountain
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
and
saul
sought
him
every
day
but
god
delivered
him
not
into
his
hand
23
15
and
david
saw
that
saul
was
come
out
to
seek
his
life
and
david
was
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
in
a
wood
23
16
and
jonathan
saul’s
son
arose
and
went
to
david
into
the
wood
and
strengthened
his
hand
in
god
23
17
and
he
said
unto
him
fear
not
for
the
hand
of
saul
my
father
shall
not
find
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
king
over
israel
and
i
shall
be
next
unto
thee
and
that
also
saul
my
father
knoweth
23
18
and
they
two
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
and
david
abode
in
the
wood
and
jonathan
went
to
his
house
23
19
then
came
up
the
ziphites
to
saul
to
gibeah
saying
doth
not
david
hide
himself
with
us
in
strong
holds
in
the
wood
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
on
the
south
of
jeshimon
23
20
now
therefore
o
king
come
down
according
to
all
the
desire
of
thy
soul
to
come
down
and
our
part
shall
be
to
deliver
him
into
the
king’s
hand
23
21
and
saul
said
blessed
be
ye
of
the
lord
for
ye
have
compassion
on
me
23
22
go
i
pray
you
prepare
yet
and
know
and
see
his
place
where
his
haunt
is
and
who
hath
seen
him
there
for
it
is
told
me
that
he
dealeth
very
subtilly
23
23
see
therefore
and
take
knowledge
of
all
the
lurking
places
where
he
hideth
himself
and
come
ye
again
to
me
with
the
certainty
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
he
be
in
the
land
that
i
will
search
him
out
throughout
all
the
thousands
of
judah
23
24
and
they
arose
and
went
to
ziph
before
saul
but
david
and
his
men
were
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
in
the
plain
on
the
south
of
jeshimon
23
25
saul
also
and
his
men
went
to
seek
him
and
they
told
david
wherefore
he
came
down
into
a
rock
and
abode
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
and
when
saul
heard
that
he
pursued
after
david
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
23
26
and
saul
went
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
and
david
and
his
men
on
that
side
of
the
mountain
and
david
made
haste
to
get
away
for
fear
of
saul
for
saul
and
his
men
compassed
david
and
his
men
round
about
to
take
them
23
27
but
there
came
a
messenger
unto
saul
saying
haste
thee
and
come
for
the
philistines
have
invaded
the
land
23
28
wherefore
saul
returned
from
pursuing
after
david
and
went
against
the
philistines
therefore
they
called
that
place
selahammahlekoth
23
29
and
david
went
up
from
thence
and
dwelt
in
strong
holds
at
engedi
24
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
saul
was
returned
from
following
the
philistines
that
it
was
told
him
saying
behold
david
is
in
the
wilderness
of
engedi
24
2
then
saul
took
three
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
israel
and
went
to
seek
david
and
his
men
upon
the
rocks
of
the
wild
goats
24
3
and
he
came
to
the
sheepcotes
by
the
way
where
was
a
cave
and
saul
went
in
to
cover
his
feet
and
david
and
his
men
remained
in
the
sides
of
the
cave
24
4
and
the
men
of
david
said
unto
him
behold
the
day
of
which
the
lord
said
unto
thee
behold
i
will
deliver
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
that
thou
mayest
do
to
him
as
it
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
then
david
arose
and
cut
off
the
skirt
of
saul’s
robe
privily
24
5
and
it
came
to
pass
afterward
that
david’s
heart
smote
him
because
he
had
cut
off
saul’s
skirt
24
6
and
he
said
unto
his
men
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
do
this
thing
unto
my
master
the
lord’s
anointed
to
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
him
seeing
he
is
the
anointed
of
the
lord
24
7
so
david
stayed
his
servants
with
these
words
and
suffered
them
not
to
rise
against
saul
but
saul
rose
up
out
of
the
cave
and
went
on
his
way
24
8
david
also
arose
afterward
and
went
out
of
the
cave
and
cried
after
saul
saying
my
lord
the
king
and
when
saul
looked
behind
him
david
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
earth
and
bowed
himself
24
9
and
david
said
to
saul
wherefore
hearest
thou
men’s
words
saying
behold
david
seeketh
thy
hurt
24
10
behold
this
day
thine
eyes
have
seen
how
that
the
lord
had
delivered
thee
to
day
into
mine
hand
in
the
cave
and
some
bade
me
kill
thee
but
mine
eye
spared
thee
and
i
said
i
will
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
my
lord
for
he
is
the
lord’s
anointed
24
11
moreover
my
father
see
yea
see
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
in
my
hand
for
in
that
i
cut
off
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
and
killed
thee
not
know
thou
and
see
that
there
is
neither
evil
nor
transgression
in
mine
hand
and
i
have
not
sinned
against
thee
yet
thou
huntest
my
soul
to
take
it
24
12
the
lord
judge
between
me
and
thee
and
the
lord
avenge
me
of
thee
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee
24
13
as
saith
the
proverb
of
the
ancients
wickedness
proceedeth
from
the
wicked
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee
24
14
after
whom
is
the
king
of
israel
come
out
after
whom
dost
thou
pursue
after
a
dead
dog
after
a
flea
24
15
the
lord
therefore
be
judge
and
judge
between
me
and
thee
and
see
and
plead
my
cause
and
deliver
me
out
of
thine
hand
24
16
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
unto
saul
that
saul
said
is
this
thy
voice
my
son
david
and
saul
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
24
17
and
he
said
to
david
thou
art
more
righteous
than
i
for
thou
hast
rewarded
me
good
whereas
i
have
rewarded
thee
evil
24
18
and
thou
hast
shewed
this
day
how
that
thou
hast
dealt
well
with
me
forasmuch
as
when
the
lord
had
delivered
me
into
thine
hand
thou
killedst
me
not
24
19
for
if
a
man
find
his
enemy
will
he
let
him
go
well
away
wherefore
the
lord
reward
thee
good
for
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me
this
day
24
20
and
now
behold
i
know
well
that
thou
shalt
surely
be
king
and
that
the
kingdom
of
israel
shall
be
established
in
thine
hand
24
21
swear
now
therefore
unto
me
by
the
lord
that
thou
wilt
not
cut
off
my
seed
after
me
and
that
thou
wilt
not
destroy
my
name
out
of
my
father’s
house
24
22
and
david
sware
unto
saul
and
saul
went
home
but
david
and
his
men
gat
them
up
unto
the
hold
25
1
and
samuel
died
and
all
the
israelites
were
gathered
together
and
lamented
him
and
buried
him
in
his
house
at
ramah
and
david
arose
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
paran
25
2
and
there
was
a
man
in
maon
whose
possessions
were
in
carmel
and
the
man
was
very
great
and
he
had
three
thousand
sheep
and
a
thousand
goats
and
he
was
shearing
his
sheep
in
carmel
25
3
now
the
name
of
the
man
was
nabal
and
the
name
of
his
wife
abigail
and
she
was
a
woman
of
good
understanding
and
of
a
beautiful
countenance
but
the
man
was
churlish
and
evil
in
his
doings
and
he
was
of
the
house
of
caleb
25
4
and
david
heard
in
the
wilderness
that
nabal
did
shear
his
sheep
25
5
and
david
sent
out
ten
young
men
and
david
said
unto
the
young
men
get
you
up
to
carmel
and
go
to
nabal
and
greet
him
in
my
name
25
6
and
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him
that
liveth
in
prosperity
peace
be
both
to
thee
and
peace
be
to
thine
house
and
peace
be
unto
all
that
thou
hast
25
7
and
now
i
have
heard
that
thou
hast
shearers
now
thy
shepherds
which
were
with
us
we
hurt
them
not
neither
was
there
ought
missing
unto
them
all
the
while
they
were
in
carmel
25
8
ask
thy
young
men
and
they
will
shew
thee
wherefore
let
the
young
men
find
favour
in
thine
eyes
for
we
come
in
a
good
day
give
i
pray
thee
whatsoever
cometh
to
thine
hand
unto
thy
servants
and
to
thy
son
david
25
9
and
when
david’s
young
men
came
they
spake
to
nabal
according
to
all
those
words
in
the
name
of
david
and
ceased
25
10
and
nabal
answered
david’s
servants
and
said
who
is
david
and
who
is
the
son
of
jesse
there
be
many
servants
now
a
days
that
break
away
every
man
from
his
master
25
11
shall
i
then
take
my
bread
and
my
water
and
my
flesh
that
i
have
killed
for
my
shearers
and
give
it
unto
men
whom
i
know
not
whence
they
be
25
12
so
david’s
young
men
turned
their
way
and
went
again
and
came
and
told
him
all
those
sayings
25
13
and
david
said
unto
his
men
gird
ye
on
every
man
his
sword
and
they
girded
on
every
man
his
sword
and
david
also
girded
on
his
sword
and
there
went
up
after
david
about
four
hundred
men
and
two
hundred
abode
by
the
stuff
25
14
but
one
of
the
young
men
told
abigail
nabal’s
wife
saying
behold
david
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
to
salute
our
master
and
he
railed
on
them
25
15
but
the
men
were
very
good
unto
us
and
we
were
not
hurt
neither
missed
we
any
thing
as
long
as
we
were
conversant
with
them
when
we
were
in
the
fields
25
16
they
were
a
wall
unto
us
both
by
night
and
day
all
the
while
we
were
with
them
keeping
the
sheep
25
17
now
therefore
know
and
consider
what
thou
wilt
do
for
evil
is
determined
against
our
master
and
against
all
his
household
for
he
is
such
a
son
of
belial
that
a
man
cannot
speak
to
him
25
18
then
abigail
made
haste
and
took
two
hundred
loaves
and
two
bottles
of
wine
and
five
sheep
ready
dressed
and
five
measures
of
parched
corn
and
an
hundred
clusters
of
raisins
and
two
hundred
cakes
of
figs
and
laid
them
on
asses
25
19
and
she
said
unto
her
servants
go
on
before
me
behold
i
come
after
you
but
she
told
not
her
husband
nabal
25
20
and
it
was
so
as
she
rode
on
the
ass
that
she
came
down
by
the
covert
on
the
hill
and
behold
david
and
his
men
came
down
against
her
and
she
met
them
25
21
now
david
had
said
surely
in
vain
have
i
kept
all
that
this
fellow
hath
in
the
wilderness
so
that
nothing
was
missed
of
all
that
pertained
unto
him
and
he
hath
requited
me
evil
for
good
25
22
so
and
more
also
do
god
unto
the
enemies
of
david
if
i
leave
of
all
that
pertain
to
him
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
25
23
and
when
abigail
saw
david
she
hasted
and
lighted
off
the
ass
and
fell
before
david
on
her
face
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
25
24
and
fell
at
his
feet
and
said
upon
me
my
lord
upon
me
let
this
iniquity
be
and
let
thine
handmaid
i
pray
thee
speak
in
thine
audience
and
hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid
25
25
let
not
my
lord
i
pray
thee
regard
this
man
of
belial
even
nabal
for
as
his
name
is
so
is
he
nabal
is
his
name
and
folly
is
with
him
but
i
thine
handmaid
saw
not
the
young
men
of
my
lord
whom
thou
didst
send
25
26
now
therefore
my
lord
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
seeing
the
lord
hath
withholden
thee
from
coming
to
shed
blood
and
from
avenging
thyself
with
thine
own
hand
now
let
thine
enemies
and
they
that
seek
evil
to
my
lord
be
as
nabal
25
27
and
now
this
blessing
which
thine
handmaid
hath
brought
unto
my
lord
let
it
even
be
given
unto
the
young
men
that
follow
my
lord
25
28
i
pray
thee
forgive
the
trespass
of
thine
handmaid
for
the
lord
will
certainly
make
my
lord
a
sure
house
because
my
lord
fighteth
the
battles
of
the
lord
and
evil
hath
not
been
found
in
thee
all
thy
days
25
29
yet
a
man
is
risen
to
pursue
thee
and
to
seek
thy
soul
but
the
soul
of
my
lord
shall
be
bound
in
the
bundle
of
life
with
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
souls
of
thine
enemies
them
shall
he
sling
out
as
out
of
the
middle
of
a
sling
25
30
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
shall
have
done
to
my
lord
according
to
all
the
good
that
he
hath
spoken
concerning
thee
and
shall
have
appointed
thee
ruler
over
israel
25
31
that
this
shall
be
no
grief
unto
thee
nor
offence
of
heart
unto
my
lord
either
that
thou
hast
shed
blood
causeless
or
that
my
lord
hath
avenged
himself
but
when
the
lord
shall
have
dealt
well
with
my
lord
then
remember
thine
handmaid
25
32
and
david
said
to
abigail
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
sent
thee
this
day
to
meet
me
25
33
and
blessed
be
thy
advice
and
blessed
be
thou
which
hast
kept
me
this
day
from
coming
to
shed
blood
and
from
avenging
myself
with
mine
own
hand
25
34
for
in
very
deed
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
liveth
which
hath
kept
me
back
from
hurting
thee
except
thou
hadst
hasted
and
come
to
meet
me
surely
there
had
not
been
left
unto
nabal
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
25
35
so
david
received
of
her
hand
that
which
she
had
brought
him
and
said
unto
her
go
up
in
peace
to
thine
house
see
i
have
hearkened
to
thy
voice
and
have
accepted
thy
person
25
36
and
abigail
came
to
nabal
and
behold
he
held
a
feast
in
his
house
like
the
feast
of
a
king
and
nabal’s
heart
was
merry
within
him
for
he
was
very
drunken
wherefore
she
told
him
nothing
less
or
more
until
the
morning
light
25
37
but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
when
the
wine
was
gone
out
of
nabal
and
his
wife
had
told
him
these
things
that
his
heart
died
within
him
and
he
became
as
a
stone
25
38
and
it
came
to
pass
about
ten
days
after
that
the
lord
smote
nabal
that
he
died
25
39
and
when
david
heard
that
nabal
was
dead
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
that
hath
pleaded
the
cause
of
my
reproach
from
the
hand
of
nabal
and
hath
kept
his
servant
from
evil
for
the
lord
hath
returned
the
wickedness
of
nabal
upon
his
own
head
and
david
sent
and
communed
with
abigail
to
take
her
to
him
to
wife
25
40
and
when
the
servants
of
david
were
come
to
abigail
to
carmel
they
spake
unto
her
saying
david
sent
us
unto
thee
to
take
thee
to
him
to
wife
25
41
and
she
arose
and
bowed
herself
on
her
face
to
the
earth
and
said
behold
let
thine
handmaid
be
a
servant
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
servants
of
my
lord
25
42
and
abigail
hasted
and
arose
and
rode
upon
an
ass
with
five
damsels
of
hers
that
went
after
her
and
she
went
after
the
messengers
of
david
and
became
his
wife
25
43
david
also
took
ahinoam
of
jezreel
and
they
were
also
both
of
them
his
wives
25
44
but
saul
had
given
michal
his
daughter
david’s
wife
to
phalti
the
son
of
laish
which
was
of
gallim
26
1
and
the
ziphites
came
unto
saul
to
gibeah
saying
doth
not
david
hide
himself
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
before
jeshimon
26
2
then
saul
arose
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
ziph
having
three
thousand
chosen
men
of
israel
with
him
to
seek
david
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
26
3
and
saul
pitched
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
before
jeshimon
by
the
way
but
david
abode
in
the
wilderness
and
he
saw
that
saul
came
after
him
into
the
wilderness
26
4
david
therefore
sent
out
spies
and
understood
that
saul
was
come
in
very
deed
26
5
and
david
arose
and
came
to
the
place
where
saul
had
pitched
and
david
beheld
the
place
where
saul
lay
and
abner
the
son
of
ner
the
captain
of
his
host
and
saul
lay
in
the
trench
and
the
people
pitched
round
about
him
26
6
then
answered
david
and
said
to
ahimelech
the
hittite
and
to
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
brother
to
joab
saying
who
will
go
down
with
me
to
saul
to
the
camp
and
abishai
said
i
will
go
down
with
thee
26
7
so
david
and
abishai
came
to
the
people
by
night
and
behold
saul
lay
sleeping
within
the
trench
and
his
spear
stuck
in
the
ground
at
his
bolster
but
abner
and
the
people
lay
round
about
him
26
8
then
said
abishai
to
david
god
hath
delivered
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
this
day
now
therefore
let
me
smite
him
i
pray
thee
with
the
spear
even
to
the
earth
at
once
and
i
will
not
smite
him
the
second
time
26
9
and
david
said
to
abishai
destroy
him
not
for
who
can
stretch
forth
his
hand
against
the
lord’s
anointed
and
be
guiltless
26
10
david
said
furthermore
as
the
lord
liveth
the
lord
shall
smite
him
or
his
day
shall
come
to
die
or
he
shall
descend
into
battle
and
perish
26
11
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
lord’s
anointed
but
i
pray
thee
take
thou
now
the
spear
that
is
at
his
bolster
and
the
cruse
of
water
and
let
us
go
26
12
so
david
took
the
spear
and
the
cruse
of
water
from
saul’s
bolster
and
they
gat
them
away
and
no
man
saw
it
nor
knew
it
neither
awaked
for
they
were
all
asleep
because
a
deep
sleep
from
the
lord
was
fallen
upon
them
26
13
then
david
went
over
to
the
other
side
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
afar
off
a
great
space
being
between
them
26
14
and
david
cried
to
the
people
and
to
abner
the
son
of
ner
saying
answerest
thou
not
abner
then
abner
answered
and
said
who
art
thou
that
criest
to
the
king
26
15
and
david
said
to
abner
art
not
thou
a
valiant
man
and
who
is
like
to
thee
in
israel
wherefore
then
hast
thou
not
kept
thy
lord
the
king
for
there
came
one
of
the
people
in
to
destroy
the
king
thy
lord
26
16
this
thing
is
not
good
that
thou
hast
done
as
the
lord
liveth
ye
are
worthy
to
die
because
ye
have
not
kept
your
master
the
lord’s
anointed
and
now
see
where
the
king’s
spear
is
and
the
cruse
of
water
that
was
at
his
bolster
26
17
and
saul
knew
david’s
voice
and
said
is
this
thy
voice
my
son
david
and
david
said
it
is
my
voice
my
lord
o
king
26
18
and
he
said
wherefore
doth
my
lord
thus
pursue
after
his
servant
for
what
have
i
done
or
what
evil
is
in
mine
hand
26
19
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
let
my
lord
the
king
hear
the
words
of
his
servant
if
the
lord
have
stirred
thee
up
against
me
let
him
accept
an
offering
but
if
they
be
the
children
of
men
cursed
be
they
before
the
lord
for
they
have
driven
me
out
this
day
from
abiding
in
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
saying
go
serve
other
gods
26
20
now
therefore
let
not
my
blood
fall
to
the
earth
before
the
face
of
the
lord
for
the
king
of
israel
is
come
out
to
seek
a
flea
as
when
one
doth
hunt
a
partridge
in
the
mountains
26
21
then
said
saul
i
have
sinned
return
my
son
david
for
i
will
no
more
do
thee
harm
because
my
soul
was
precious
in
thine
eyes
this
day
behold
i
have
played
the
fool
and
have
erred
exceedingly
26
22
and
david
answered
and
said
behold
the
king’s
spear
and
let
one
of
the
young
men
come
over
and
fetch
it
26
23
the
lord
render
to
every
man
his
righteousness
and
his
faithfulness
for
the
lord
delivered
thee
into
my
hand
to
day
but
i
would
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
lord’s
anointed
26
24
and
behold
as
thy
life
was
much
set
by
this
day
in
mine
eyes
so
let
my
life
be
much
set
by
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
let
him
deliver
me
out
of
all
tribulation
26
25
then
saul
said
to
david
blessed
be
thou
my
son
david
thou
shalt
both
do
great
things
and
also
shalt
still
prevail
so
david
went
on
his
way
and
saul
returned
to
his
place
27
1
and
david
said
in
his
heart
i
shall
now
perish
one
day
by
the
hand
of
saul
there
is
nothing
better
for
me
than
that
i
should
speedily
escape
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
saul
shall
despair
of
me
to
seek
me
any
more
in
any
coast
of
israel
so
shall
i
escape
out
of
his
hand
27
2
and
david
arose
and
he
passed
over
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
unto
achish
the
son
of
maoch
king
of
gath
27
3
and
david
dwelt
with
achish
at
gath
he
and
his
men
every
man
with
his
household
even
david
with
his
two
wives
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
the
carmelitess
nabal’s
wife
27
4
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
fled
to
gath
and
he
sought
no
more
again
for
him
27
5
and
david
said
unto
achish
if
i
have
now
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
some
town
in
the
country
that
i
may
dwell
there
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
in
the
royal
city
with
thee
27
6
then
achish
gave
him
ziklag
that
day
wherefore
ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
of
judah
unto
this
day
27
7
and
the
time
that
david
dwelt
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
was
a
full
year
and
four
months
27
8
and
david
and
his
men
went
up
and
invaded
the
geshurites
and
the
gezrites
and
the
amalekites
for
those
nations
were
of
old
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
as
thou
goest
to
shur
even
unto
the
land
of
egypt
27
9
and
david
smote
the
land
and
left
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
and
took
away
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
the
asses
and
the
camels
and
the
apparel
and
returned
and
came
to
achish
27
10
and
achish
said
whither
have
ye
made
a
road
to
day
and
david
said
against
the
south
of
judah
and
against
the
south
of
the
jerahmeelites
and
against
the
south
of
the
kenites
27
11
and
david
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
to
bring
tidings
to
gath
saying
lest
they
should
tell
on
us
saying
so
did
david
and
so
will
be
his
manner
all
the
while
he
dwelleth
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
27
12
and
achish
believed
david
saying
he
hath
made
his
people
israel
utterly
to
abhor
him
therefore
he
shall
be
my
servant
for
ever
28
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
the
philistines
gathered
their
armies
together
for
warfare
to
fight
with
israel
and
achish
said
unto
david
know
thou
assuredly
that
thou
shalt
go
out
with
me
to
battle
thou
and
thy
men
28
2
and
david
said
to
achish
surely
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
can
do
and
achish
said
to
david
therefore
will
i
make
thee
keeper
of
mine
head
for
ever
28

now
samuel
was
dead
and
all
israel
had
lamented
him
and
buried
him
in
ramah
even
in
his
own
city
and
saul
had
put
away
those
that
had
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
of
the
land
28
4
and
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
and
pitched
in
shunem
and
saul
gathered
all
israel
together
and
they
pitched
in
gilboa
28
5
and
when
saul
saw
the
host
of
the
philistines
he
was
afraid
and
his
heart
greatly
trembled
28
6
and
when
saul
enquired
of
the
lord
the
lord
answered
him
not
neither
by
dreams
nor
by
urim
nor
by
prophets
28
7
then
said
saul
unto
his
servants
seek
me
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
that
i
may
go
to
her
and
enquire
of
her
and
his
servants
said
to
him
behold
there
is
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
at
endor
28
8
and
saul
disguised
himself
and
put
on
other
raiment
and
he
went
and
two
men
with
him
and
they
came
to
the
woman
by
night
and
he
said
i
pray
thee
divine
unto
me
by
the
familiar
spirit
and
bring
me
him
up
whom
i
shall
name
unto
thee
28
9
and
the
woman
said
unto
him
behold
thou
knowest
what
saul
hath
done
how
he
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
of
the
land
wherefore
then
layest
thou
a
snare
for
my
life
to
cause
me
to
die
28
10
and
saul
sware
to
her
by
the
lord
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
no
punishment
happen
to
thee
for
this
thing
28
11
then
said
the
woman
whom
shall
i
bring
up
unto
thee
and
he
said
bring
me
up
samuel
28
12
and
when
the
woman
saw
samuel
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
the
woman
spake
to
saul
saying
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
for
thou
art
saul
28
13
and
the
king
said
unto
her
be
not
afraid
for
what
sawest
thou
and
the
woman
said
unto
saul
i
saw
gods
ascending
out
of
the
earth
28
14
and
he
said
unto
her
what
form
is
he
of
and
she
said
an
old
man
cometh
up
and
he
is
covered
with
a
mantle
and
saul
perceived
that
it
was
samuel
and
he
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
28
15
and
samuel
said
to
saul
why
hast
thou
disquieted
me
to
bring
me
up
and
saul
answered
i
am
sore
distressed
for
the
philistines
make
war
against
me
and
god
is
departed
from
me
and
answereth
me
no
more
neither
by
prophets
nor
by
dreams
therefore
i
have
called
thee
that
thou
mayest
make
known
unto
me
what
i
shall
do
28
16
then
said
samuel
wherefore
then
dost
thou
ask
of
me
seeing
the
lord
is
departed
from
thee
and
is
become
thine
enemy
28
17
and
the
lord
hath
done
to
him
as
he
spake
by
me
for
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
out
of
thine
hand
and
given
it
to
thy
neighbour
even
to
david
28
18
because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
nor
executedst
his
fierce
wrath
upon
amalek
therefore
hath
the
lord
done
this
thing
unto
thee
this
day
28
19
moreover
the
lord
will
also
deliver
israel
with
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
to
morrow
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
be
with
me
the
lord
also
shall
deliver
the
host
of
israel
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
28
20
then
saul
fell
straightway
all
along
on
the
earth
and
was
sore
afraid
because
of
the
words
of
samuel
and
there
was
no
strength
in
him
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
all
the
day
nor
all
the
night
28
21
and
the
woman
came
unto
saul
and
saw
that
he
was
sore
troubled
and
said
unto
him
behold
thine
handmaid
hath
obeyed
thy
voice
and
i
have
put
my
life
in
my
hand
and
have
hearkened
unto
thy
words
which
thou
spakest
unto
me
28
22
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
hearken
thou
also
unto
the
voice
of
thine
handmaid
and
let
me
set
a
morsel
of
bread
before
thee
and
eat
that
thou
mayest
have
strength
when
thou
goest
on
thy
way
28
23
but
he
refused
and
said
i
will
not
eat
but
his
servants
together
with
the
woman
compelled
him
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
voice
so
he
arose
from
the
earth
and
sat
upon
the
bed
28
24
and
the
woman
had
a
fat
calf
in
the
house
and
she
hasted
and
killed
it
and
took
flour
and
kneaded
it
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
thereof
28
25
and
she
brought
it
before
saul
and
before
his
servants
and
they
did
eat
then
they
rose
up
and
went
away
that
night
29
1
now
the
philistines
gathered
together
all
their
armies
to
aphek
and
the
israelites
pitched
by
a
fountain
which
is
in
jezreel
29
2
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
passed
on
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
but
david
and
his
men
passed
on
in
the
rereward
with
achish
29
3
then
said
the
princes
of
the
philistines
what
do
these
hebrews
here
and
achish
said
unto
the
princes
of
the
philistines
is
not
this
david
the
servant
of
saul
the
king
of
israel
which
hath
been
with
me
these
days
or
these
years
and
i
have
found
no
fault
in
him
since
he
fell
unto
me
unto
this
day
29
4
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
were
wroth
with
him
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
said
unto
him
make
this
fellow
return
that
he
may
go
again
to
his
place
which
thou
hast
appointed
him
and
let
him
not
go
down
with
us
to
battle
lest
in
the
battle
he
be
an
adversary
to
us
for
wherewith
should
he
reconcile
himself
unto
his
master
should
it
not
be
with
the
heads
of
these
men
29
5
is
not
this
david
of
whom
they
sang
one
to
another
in
dances
saying
saul
slew
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
29
6
then
achish
called
david
and
said
unto
him
surely
as
the
lord
liveth
thou
hast
been
upright
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
with
me
in
the
host
is
good
in
my
sight
for
i
have
not
found
evil
in
thee
since
the
day
of
thy
coming
unto
me
unto
this
day
nevertheless
the
lords
favour
thee
not
29
7
wherefore
now
return
and
go
in
peace
that
thou
displease
not
the
lords
of
the
philistines
29
8
and
david
said
unto
achish
but
what
have
i
done
and
what
hast
thou
found
in
thy
servant
so
long
as
i
have
been
with
thee
unto
this
day
that
i
may
not
go
fight
against
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
29
9
and
achish
answered
and
said
to
david
i
know
that
thou
art
good
in
my
sight
as
an
angel
of
god
notwithstanding
the
princes
of
the
philistines
have
said
he
shall
not
go
up
with
us
to
the
battle
29
10
wherefore
now
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
with
thy
master’s
servants
that
are
come
with
thee
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
have
light
depart
29
11
so
david
and
his
men
rose
up
early
to
depart
in
the
morning
to
return
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
went
up
to
jezreel
30
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
and
his
men
were
come
to
ziklag
on
the
third
day
that
the
amalekites
had
invaded
the
south
and
ziklag
and
smitten
ziklag
and
burned
it
with
fire
30
2
and
had
taken
the
women
captives
that
were
therein
they
slew
not
any
either
great
or
small
but
carried
them
away
and
went
on
their
way
30
3
so
david
and
his
men
came
to
the
city
and
behold
it
was
burned
with
fire
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
were
taken
captives
30
4
then
david
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
until
they
had
no
more
power
to
weep
30
5
and
david’s
two
wives
were
taken
captives
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
the
wife
of
nabal
the
carmelite
30
6
and
david
was
greatly
distressed
for
the
people
spake
of
stoning
him
because
the
soul
of
all
the
people
was
grieved
every
man
for
his
sons
and
for
his
daughters
but
david
encouraged
himself
in
the
lord
his
god
30
7
and
david
said
to
abiathar
the
priest
ahimelech’s
son
i
pray
thee
bring
me
hither
the
ephod
and
abiathar
brought
thither
the
ephod
to
david
30
8
and
david
enquired
at
the
lord
saying
shall
i
pursue
after
this
troop
shall
i
overtake
them
and
he
answered
him
pursue
for
thou
shalt
surely
overtake
them
and
without
fail
recover
all
30
9
so
david
went
he
and
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
and
came
to
the
brook
besor
where
those
that
were
left
behind
stayed
30
10
but
david
pursued
he
and
four
hundred
men
for
two
hundred
abode
behind
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
go
over
the
brook
besor
30
11
and
they
found
an
egyptian
in
the
field
and
brought
him
to
david
and
gave
him
bread
and
he
did
eat
and
they
made
him
drink
water
30
12
and
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
cake
of
figs
and
two
clusters
of
raisins
and
when
he
had
eaten
his
spirit
came
again
to
him
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
nor
drunk
any
water
three
days
and
three
nights
30
13
and
david
said
unto
him
to
whom
belongest
thou
and
whence
art
thou
and
he
said
i
am
a
young
man
of
egypt
servant
to
an
amalekite
and
my
master
left
me
because
three
days
agone
i
fell
sick
30
14
we
made
an
invasion
upon
the
south
of
the
cherethites
and
upon
the
coast
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
upon
the
south
of
caleb
and
we
burned
ziklag
with
fire
30
15
and
david
said
to
him
canst
thou
bring
me
down
to
this
company
and
he
said
swear
unto
me
by
god
that
thou
wilt
neither
kill
me
nor
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
my
master
and
i
will
bring
thee
down
to
this
company
30
16
and
when
he
had
brought
him
down
behold
they
were
spread
abroad
upon
all
the
earth
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
because
of
all
the
great
spoil
that
they
had
taken
out
of
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
out
of
the
land
of
judah
30
17
and
david
smote
them
from
the
twilight
even
unto
the
evening
of
the
next
day
and
there
escaped
not
a
man
of
them
save
four
hundred
young
men
which
rode
upon
camels
and
fled
30
18
and
david
recovered
all
that
the
amalekites
had
carried
away
and
david
rescued
his
two
wives
30
19
and
there
was
nothing
lacking
to
them
neither
small
nor
great
neither
sons
nor
daughters
neither
spoil
nor
any
thing
that
they
had
taken
to
them
david
recovered
all
30
20
and
david
took
all
the
flocks
and
the
herds
which
they
drave
before
those
other
cattle
and
said
this
is
david’s
spoil
30
21
and
david
came
to
the
two
hundred
men
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
follow
david
whom
they
had
made
also
to
abide
at
the
brook
besor
and
they
went
forth
to
meet
david
and
to
meet
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
when
david
came
near
to
the
people
he
saluted
them
30
22
then
answered
all
the
wicked
men
and
men
of
belial
of
those
that
went
with
david
and
said
because
they
went
not
with
us
we
will
not
give
them
ought
of
the
spoil
that
we
have
recovered
save
to
every
man
his
wife
and
his
children
that
they
may
lead
them
away
and
depart
30
23
then
said
david
ye
shall
not
do
so
my
brethren
with
that
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
who
hath
preserved
us
and
delivered
the
company
that
came
against
us
into
our
hand
30
24
for
who
will
hearken
unto
you
in
this
matter
but
as
his
part
is
that
goeth
down
to
the
battle
so
shall
his
part
be
that
tarrieth
by
the
stuff
they
shall
part
alike
30
25
and
it
was
so
from
that
day
forward
that
he
made
it
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
for
israel
unto
this
day
30
26
and
when
david
came
to
ziklag
he
sent
of
the
spoil
unto
the
elders
of
judah
even
to
his
friends
saying
behold
a
present
for
you
of
the
spoil
of
the
enemies
of
the
lord
30
27
to
them
which
were
in
bethel
and
to
them
which
were
in
south
ramoth
and
to
them
which
were
in
jattir
30
28
and
to
them
which
were
in
aroer
and
to
them
which
were
in
siphmoth
and
to
them
which
were
in
eshtemoa
30
29
and
to
them
which
were
in
rachal
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
jerahmeelites
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
kenites
30
30
and
to
them
which
were
in
hormah
and
to
them
which
were
in
chorashan
and
to
them
which
were
in
athach
30
31
and
to
them
which
were
in
hebron
and
to
all
the
places
where
david
himself
and
his
men
were
wont
to
haunt
31
1
now
the
philistines
fought
against
israel
and
the
men
of
israel
fled
from
before
the
philistines
and
fell
down
slain
in
mount
gilboa
31
2
and
the
philistines
followed
hard
upon
saul
and
upon
his
sons
and
the
philistines
slew
jonathan
and
abinadab
and
melchishua
saul’s
sons
31
3
and
the
battle
went
sore
against
saul
and
the
archers
hit
him
and
he
was
sore
wounded
of
the
archers
31
4
then
said
saul
unto
his
armourbearer
draw
thy
sword
and
thrust
me
through
therewith
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
thrust
me
through
and
abuse
me
but
his
armourbearer
would
not
for
he
was
sore
afraid
therefore
saul
took
a
sword
and
fell
upon
it
31
5
and
when
his
armourbearer
saw
that
saul
was
dead
he
fell
likewise
upon
his
sword
and
died
with
him
31
6
so
saul
died
and
his
three
sons
and
his
armourbearer
and
all
his
men
that
same
day
together
31
7
and
when
the
men
of
israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
and
they
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
saw
that
the
men
of
israel
fled
and
that
saul
and
his
sons
were
dead
they
forsook
the
cities
and
fled
and
the
philistines
came
and
dwelt
in
them
31
8
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
when
the
philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain
that
they
found
saul
and
his
three
sons
fallen
in
mount
gilboa
31
9
and
they
cut
off
his
head
and
stripped
off
his
armour
and
sent
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
round
about
to
publish
it
in
the
house
of
their
idols
and
among
the
people
31
10
and
they
put
his
armour
in
the
house
of
ashtaroth
and
they
fastened
his
body
to
the
wall
of
bethshan
31
11
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
heard
of
that
which
the
philistines
had
done
to
saul
31
12
all
the
valiant
men
arose
and
went
all
night
and
took
the
body
of
saul
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons
from
the
wall
of
bethshan
and
came
to
jabesh
and
burnt
them
there
31
13
and
they
took
their
bones
and
buried
them
under
a
tree
at
jabesh
and
fasted
seven
days
the
second
book
of
samuel
otherwise
called
the
second
book
of
the
kings
1
1
now
it
came
to
pass
after
the
death
of
saul
when
david
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
amalekites
and
david
had
abode
two
days
in
ziklag
1
2
it
came
even
to
pass
on
the
third
day
that
behold
a
man
came
out
of
the
camp
from
saul
with
his
clothes
rent
and
earth
upon
his
head
and
so
it
was
when
he
came
to
david
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
did
obeisance
1
3
and
david
said
unto
him
from
whence
comest
thou
and
he
said
unto
him
out
of
the
camp
of
israel
am
i
escaped
1
4
and
david
said
unto
him
how
went
the
matter
i
pray
thee
tell
me
and
he
answered
that
the
people
are
fled
from
the
battle
and
many
of
the
people
also
are
fallen
and
dead
and
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
are
dead
also
1
5
and
david
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
how
knowest
thou
that
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
be
dead
1
6
and
the
young
man
that
told
him
said
as
i
happened
by
chance
upon
mount
gilboa
behold
saul
leaned
upon
his
spear
and
lo
the
chariots
and
horsemen
followed
hard
after
him
1
7
and
when
he
looked
behind
him
he
saw
me
and
called
unto
me
and
i
answered
here
am
i
1
8
and
he
said
unto
me
who
art
thou
and
i
answered
him
i
am
an
amalekite
1
9
he
said
unto
me
again
stand
i
pray
thee
upon
me
and
slay
me
for
anguish
is
come
upon
me
because
my
life
is
yet
whole
in
me
1
10
so
i
stood
upon
him
and
slew
him
because
i
was
sure
that
he
could
not
live
after
that
he
was
fallen
and
i
took
the
crown
that
was
upon
his
head
and
the
bracelet
that
was
on
his
arm
and
have
brought
them
hither
unto
my
lord
1
11
then
david
took
hold
on
his
clothes
and
rent
them
and
likewise
all
the
men
that
were
with
him
1
12
and
they
mourned
and
wept
and
fasted
until
even
for
saul
and
for
jonathan
his
son
and
for
the
people
of
the
lord
and
for
the
house
of
israel
because
they
were
fallen
by
the
sword
1
13
and
david
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
whence
art
thou
and
he
answered
i
am
the
son
of
a
stranger
an
amalekite
1
14
and
david
said
unto
him
how
wast
thou
not
afraid
to
stretch
forth
thine
hand
to
destroy
the
lord’s
anointed
1
15
and
david
called
one
of
the
young
men
and
said
go
near
and
fall
upon
him
and
he
smote
him
that
he
died
1
16
and
david
said
unto
him
thy
blood
be
upon
thy
head
for
thy
mouth
hath
testified
against
thee
saying
i
have
slain
the
lord’s
anointed
1
17
and
david
lamented
with
this
lamentation
over
saul
and
over
jonathan
his
son
1
18
(also
he
bade
them
teach
the
children
of
judah
the
use
of
the
bow
behold
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
jasher
)
1
19
the
beauty
of
israel
is
slain
upon
thy
high
places
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
1
20
tell
it
not
in
gath
publish
it
not
in
the
streets
of
askelon
lest
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
rejoice
lest
the
daughters
of
the
uncircumcised
triumph
1
21
ye
mountains
of
gilboa
let
there
be
no
dew
neither
let
there
be
rain
upon
you
nor
fields
of
offerings
for
there
the
shield
of
the
mighty
is
vilely
cast
away
the
shield
of
saul
as
though
he
had
not
been
anointed
with
oil
1
22
from
the
blood
of
the
slain
from
the
fat
of
the
mighty
the
bow
of
jonathan
turned
not
back
and
the
sword
of
saul
returned
not
empty
1
23
saul
and
jonathan
were
lovely
and
pleasant
in
their
lives
and
in
their
death
they
were
not
divided
they
were
swifter
than
eagles
they
were
stronger
than
lions
1
24
ye
daughters
of
israel
weep
over
saul
who
clothed
you
in
scarlet
with
other
delights
who
put
on
ornaments
of
gold
upon
your
apparel
1
25
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
o
jonathan
thou
wast
slain
in
thine
high
places
1
26
i
am
distressed
for
thee
my
brother
jonathan
very
pleasant
hast
thou
been
unto
me
thy
love
to
me
was
wonderful
passing
the
love
of
women
1
27
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
and
the
weapons
of
war
perished
2
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
up
into
any
of
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
up
and
david
said
whither
shall
i
go
up
and
he
said
unto
hebron
2
2
so
david
went
up
thither
and
his
two
wives
also
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
nabal’s
wife
the
carmelite
2
3
and
his
men
that
were
with
him
did
david
bring
up
every
man
with
his
household
and
they
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
hebron
2
4
and
the
men
of
judah
came
and
there
they
anointed
david
king
over
the
house
of
judah
and
they
told
david
saying
that
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
were
they
that
buried
saul
2
5
and
david
sent
messengers
unto
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
and
said
unto
them
blessed
be
ye
of
the
lord
that
ye
have
shewed
this
kindness
unto
your
lord
even
unto
saul
and
have
buried
him
2
6
and
now
the
lord
shew
kindness
and
truth
unto
you
and
i
also
will
requite
you
this
kindness
because
ye
have
done
this
thing
2
7
therefore
now
let
your
hands
be
strengthened
and
be
ye
valiant
for
your
master
saul
is
dead
and
also
the
house
of
judah
have
anointed
me
king
over
them
2
8
but
abner
the
son
of
ner
captain
of
saul’s
host
took
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
and
brought
him
over
to
mahanaim
2
9
and
made
him
king
over
gilead
and
over
the
ashurites
and
over
jezreel
and
over
ephraim
and
over
benjamin
and
over
all
israel
2
10
ishbosheth
saul’s
son
was
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
over
israel
and
reigned
two
years
but
the
house
of
judah
followed
david
2
11
and
the
time
that
david
was
king
in
hebron
over
the
house
of
judah
was
seven
years
and
six
months
2
12
and
abner
the
son
of
ner
and
the
servants
of
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
went
out
from
mahanaim
to
gibeon
2
13
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
and
the
servants
of
david
went
out
and
met
together
by
the
pool
of
gibeon
and
they
sat
down
the
one
on
the
one
side
of
the
pool
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
2
14
and
abner
said
to
joab
let
the
young
men
now
arise
and
play
before
us
and
joab
said
let
them
arise
2
15
then
there
arose
and
went
over
by
number
twelve
of
benjamin
which
pertained
to
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
and
twelve
of
the
servants
of
david
2
16
and
they
caught
every
one
his
fellow
by
the
head
and
thrust
his
sword
in
his
fellow’s
side
so
they
fell
down
together
wherefore
that
place
was
called
helkathhazzurim
which
is
in
gibeon
2
17
and
there
was
a
very
sore
battle
that
day
and
abner
was
beaten
and
the
men
of
israel
before
the
servants
of
david
2
18
and
there
were
three
sons
of
zeruiah
there
joab
and
abishai
and
asahel
and
asahel
was
as
light
of
foot
as
a
wild
roe
2
19
and
asahel
pursued
after
abner
and
in
going
he
turned
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
from
following
abner
2
20
then
abner
looked
behind
him
and
said
art
thou
asahel
and
he
answered
i
am
2
21
and
abner
said
to
him
turn
thee
aside
to
thy
right
hand
or
to
thy
left
and
lay
thee
hold
on
one
of
the
young
men
and
take
thee
his
armour
but
asahel
would
not
turn
aside
from
following
of
him
2
22
and
abner
said
again
to
asahel
turn
thee
aside
from
following
me
wherefore
should
i
smite
thee
to
the
ground
how
then
should
i
hold
up
my
face
to
joab
thy
brother
2
23
howbeit
he
refused
to
turn
aside
wherefore
abner
with
the
hinder
end
of
the
spear
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib
that
the
spear
came
out
behind
him
and
he
fell
down
there
and
died
in
the
same
place
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
came
to
the
place
where
asahel
fell
down
and
died
stood
still
2
24
joab
also
and
abishai
pursued
after
abner
and
the
sun
went
down
when
they
were
come
to
the
hill
of
ammah
that
lieth
before
giah
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
gibeon
2
25
and
the
children
of
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
after
abner
and
became
one
troop
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
2
26
then
abner
called
to
joab
and
said
shall
the
sword
devour
for
ever
knowest
thou
not
that
it
will
be
bitterness
in
the
latter
end
how
long
shall
it
be
then
ere
thou
bid
the
people
return
from
following
their
brethren
2
27
and
joab
said
as
god
liveth
unless
thou
hadst
spoken
surely
then
in
the
morning
the
people
had
gone
up
every
one
from
following
his
brother
2
28
so
joab
blew
a
trumpet
and
all
the
people
stood
still
and
pursued
after
israel
no
more
neither
fought
they
any
more
2
29
and
abner
and
his
men
walked
all
that
night
through
the
plain
and
passed
over
jordan
and
went
through
all
bithron
and
they
came
to
mahanaim
2
30
and
joab
returned
from
following
abner
and
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
people
together
there
lacked
of
david’s
servants
nineteen
men
and
asahel
2
31
but
the
servants
of
david
had
smitten
of
benjamin
and
of
abner’s
men
so
that
three
hundred
and
threescore
men
died
2
32
and
they
took
up
asahel
and
buried
him
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father
which
was
in
bethlehem
and
joab
and
his
men
went
all
night
and
they
came
to
hebron
at
break
of
day
3
1
now
there
was
long
war
between
the
house
of
saul
and
the
house
of
david
but
david
waxed
stronger
and
stronger
and
the
house
of
saul
waxed
weaker
and
weaker
3
2
and
unto
david
were
sons
born
in
hebron
and
his
firstborn
was
amnon
of
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
3
3
and
his
second
chileab
of
abigail
the
wife
of
nabal
the
carmelite
and
the
third
absalom
the
son
of
maacah
the
daughter
of
talmai
king
of
geshur
3
4
and
the
fourth
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
and
the
fifth
shephatiah
the
son
of
abital
3
5
and
the
sixth
ithream
by
eglah
david’s
wife
these
were
born
to
david
in
hebron
3
6
and
it
came
to
pass
while
there
was
war
between
the
house
of
saul
and
the
house
of
david
that
abner
made
himself
strong
for
the
house
of
saul
3
7
and
saul
had
a
concubine
whose
name
was
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
and
ishbosheth
said
to
abner
wherefore
hast
thou
gone
in
unto
my
father’s
concubine
3
8
then
was
abner
very
wroth
for
the
words
of
ishbosheth
and
said
am
i
a
dog’s
head
which
against
judah
do
shew
kindness
this
day
unto
the
house
of
saul
thy
father
to
his
brethren
and
to
his
friends
and
have
not
delivered
thee
into
the
hand
of
david
that
thou
chargest
me
to
day
with
a
fault
concerning
this
woman
3
9
so
do
god
to
abner
and
more
also
except
as
the
lord
hath
sworn
to
david
even
so
i
do
to
him
3
10
to
translate
the
kingdom
from
the
house
of
saul
and
to
set
up
the
throne
of
david
over
israel
and
over
judah
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
3
11
and
he
could
not
answer
abner
a
word
again
because
he
feared
him
3
12
and
abner
sent
messengers
to
david
on
his
behalf
saying
whose
is
the
land
saying
also
make
thy
league
with
me
and
behold
my
hand
shall
be
with
thee
to
bring
about
all
israel
unto
thee
3
13
and
he
said
well
i
will
make
a
league
with
thee
but
one
thing
i
require
of
thee
that
is
thou
shalt
not
see
my
face
except
thou
first
bring
michal
saul’s
daughter
when
thou
comest
to
see
my
face
3
14
and
david
sent
messengers
to
ishbosheth
saul’s
son
saying
deliver
me
my
wife
michal
which
i
espoused
to
me
for
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
philistines
3
15
and
ishbosheth
sent
and
took
her
from
her
husband
even
from
phaltiel
the
son
of
laish
3
16
and
her
husband
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
to
bahurim
then
said
abner
unto
him
go
return
and
he
returned
3
17
and
abner
had
communication
with
the
elders
of
israel
saying
ye
sought
for
david
in
times
past
to
be
king
over
you
3
18
now
then
do
it
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
of
david
saying
by
the
hand
of
my
servant
david
i
will
save
my
people
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
their
enemies
3
19
and
abner
also
spake
in
the
ears
of
benjamin
and
abner
went
also
to
speak
in
the
ears
of
david
in
hebron
all
that
seemed
good
to
israel
and
that
seemed
good
to
the
whole
house
of
benjamin
3
20
so
abner
came
to
david
to
hebron
and
twenty
men
with
him
and
david
made
abner
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
a
feast
3
21
and
abner
said
unto
david
i
will
arise
and
go
and
will
gather
all
israel
unto
my
lord
the
king
that
they
may
make
a
league
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
reign
over
all
that
thine
heart
desireth
and
david
sent
abner
away
and
he
went
in
peace
3
22
and
behold
the
servants
of
david
and
joab
came
from
pursuing
a
troop
and
brought
in
a
great
spoil
with
them
but
abner
was
not
with
david
in
hebron
for
he
had
sent
him
away
and
he
was
gone
in
peace
3
23
when
joab
and
all
the
host
that
was
with
him
were
come
they
told
joab
saying
abner
the
son
of
ner
came
to
the
king
and
he
hath
sent
him
away
and
he
is
gone
in
peace
3
24
then
joab
came
to
the
king
and
said
what
hast
thou
done
behold
abner
came
unto
thee
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
him
away
and
he
is
quite
gone
3
25
thou
knowest
abner
the
son
of
ner
that
he
came
to
deceive
thee
and
to
know
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
to
know
all
that
thou
doest
3
26
and
when
joab
was
come
out
from
david
he
sent
messengers
after
abner
which
brought
him
again
from
the
well
of
sirah
but
david
knew
it
not
3
27
and
when
abner
was
returned
to
hebron
joab
took
him
aside
in
the
gate
to
speak
with
him
quietly
and
smote
him
there
under
the
fifth
rib
that
he
died
for
the
blood
of
asahel
his
brother
3
28
and
afterward
when
david
heard
it
he
said
i
and
my
kingdom
are
guiltless
before
the
lord
for
ever
from
the
blood
of
abner
the
son
of
ner
3
29
let
it
rest
on
the
head
of
joab
and
on
all
his
father’s
house
and
let
there
not
fail
from
the
house
of
joab
one
that
hath
an
issue
or
that
is
a
leper
or
that
leaneth
on
a
staff
or
that
falleth
on
the
sword
or
that
lacketh
bread
3
30
so
joab
and
abishai
his
brother
slew
abner
because
he
had
slain
their
brother
asahel
at
gibeon
in
the
battle
3
31
and
david
said
to
joab
and
to
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
rend
your
clothes
and
gird
you
with
sackcloth
and
mourn
before
abner
and
king
david
himself
followed
the
bier
3
32
and
they
buried
abner
in
hebron
and
the
king
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
at
the
grave
of
abner
and
all
the
people
wept
3
33
and
the
king
lamented
over
abner
and
said
died
abner
as
a
fool
dieth
3
34
thy
hands
were
not
bound
nor
thy
feet
put
into
fetters
as
a
man
falleth
before
wicked
men
so
fellest
thou
and
all
the
people
wept
again
over
him
3
35
and
when
all
the
people
came
to
cause
david
to
eat
meat
while
it
was
yet
day
david
sware
saying
so
do
god
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
taste
bread
or
ought
else
till
the
sun
be
down
3
36
and
all
the
people
took
notice
of
it
and
it
pleased
them
as
whatsoever
the
king
did
pleased
all
the
people
3
37
for
all
the
people
and
all
israel
understood
that
day
that
it
was
not
of
the
king
to
slay
abner
the
son
of
ner
3
38
and
the
king
said
unto
his
servants
know
ye
not
that
there
is
a
prince
and
a
great
man
fallen
this
day
in
israel
3
39
and
i
am
this
day
weak
though
anointed
king
and
these
men
the
sons
of
zeruiah
be
too
hard
for
me
the
lord
shall
reward
the
doer
of
evil
according
to
his
wickedness
4
1
and
when
saul’s
son
heard
that
abner
was
dead
in
hebron
his
hands
were
feeble
and
all
the
israelites
were
troubled
4
2
and
saul’s
son
had
two
men
that
were
captains
of
bands
the
name
of
the
one
was
baanah
and
the
name
of
the
other
rechab
the
sons
of
rimmon
a
beerothite
of
the
children
of
benjamin
(for
beeroth
also
was
reckoned
to
benjamin
4
3
and
the
beerothites
fled
to
gittaim
and
were
sojourners
there
until
this
day
)
4
4
and
jonathan
saul’s
son
had
a
son
that
was
lame
of
his
feet
he
was
five
years
old
when
the
tidings
came
of
saul
and
jonathan
out
of
jezreel
and
his
nurse
took
him
up
and
fled
and
it
came
to
pass
as
she
made
haste
to
flee
that
he
fell
and
became
lame
and
his
name
was
mephibosheth
4
5
and
the
sons
of
rimmon
the
beerothite
rechab
and
baanah
went
and
came
about
the
heat
of
the
day
to
the
house
of
ishbosheth
who
lay
on
a
bed
at
noon
4
6
and
they
came
thither
into
the
midst
of
the
house
as
though
they
would
have
fetched
wheat
and
they
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib
and
rechab
and
baanah
his
brother
escaped
4
7
for
when
they
came
into
the
house
he
lay
on
his
bed
in
his
bedchamber
and
they
smote
him
and
slew
him
and
beheaded
him
and
took
his
head
and
gat
them
away
through
the
plain
all
night
4
8
and
they
brought
the
head
of
ishbosheth
unto
david
to
hebron
and
said
to
the
king
behold
the
head
of
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
thine
enemy
which
sought
thy
life
and
the
lord
hath
avenged
my
lord
the
king
this
day
of
saul
and
of
his
seed
4
9
and
david
answered
rechab
and
baanah
his
brother
the
sons
of
rimmon
the
beerothite
and
said
unto
them
as
the
lord
liveth
who
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
adversity
4
10
when
one
told
me
saying
behold
saul
is
dead
thinking
to
have
brought
good
tidings
i
took
hold
of
him
and
slew
him
in
ziklag
who
thought
that
i
would
have
given
him
a
reward
for
his
tidings
4
11
how
much
more
when
wicked
men
have
slain
a
righteous
person
in
his
own
house
upon
his
bed
shall
i
not
therefore
now
require
his
blood
of
your
hand
and
take
you
away
from
the
earth
4
12
and
david
commanded
his
young
men
and
they
slew
them
and
cut
off
their
hands
and
their
feet
and
hanged
them
up
over
the
pool
in
hebron
but
they
took
the
head
of
ishbosheth
and
buried
it
in
the
sepulchre
of
abner
in
hebron
5
1
then
came
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
david
unto
hebron
and
spake
saying
behold
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh
5
2
also
in
time
past
when
saul
was
king
over
us
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
israel
and
the
lord
said
to
thee
thou
shalt
feed
my
people
israel
and
thou
shalt
be
a
captain
over
israel
5
3
so
all
the
elders
of
israel
came
to
the
king
to
hebron
and
king
david
made
a
league
with
them
in
hebron
before
the
lord
and
they
anointed
david
king
over
israel
5
4
david
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
forty
years
5
5
in
hebron
he
reigned
over
judah
seven
years
and
six
months
and
in
jerusalem
he
reigned
thirty
and
three
years
over
all
israel
and
judah
5
6
and
the
king
and
his
men
went
to
jerusalem
unto
the
jebusites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
which
spake
unto
david
saying
except
thou
take
away
the
blind
and
the
lame
thou
shalt
not
come
in
hither
thinking
david
cannot
come
in
hither
5
7
nevertheless
david
took
the
strong
hold
of
zion
the
same
is
the
city
of
david
5
8
and
david
said
on
that
day
whosoever
getteth
up
to
the
gutter
and
smiteth
the
jebusites
and
the
lame
and
the
blind
that
are
hated
of
david’s
soul
he
shall
be
chief
and
captain
wherefore
they
said
the
blind
and
the
lame
shall
not
come
into
the
house
5
9
so
david
dwelt
in
the
fort
and
called
it
the
city
of
david
and
david
built
round
about
from
millo
and
inward
5
10
and
david
went
on
and
grew
great
and
the
lord
god
of
hosts
was
with
him
5
11
and
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
messengers
to
david
and
cedar
trees
and
carpenters
and
masons
and
they
built
david
an
house
5
12
and
david
perceived
that
the
lord
had
established
him
king
over
israel
and
that
he
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
israel’s
sake
5
13
and
david
took
him
more
concubines
and
wives
out
of
jerusalem
after
he
was
come
from
hebron
and
there
were
yet
sons
and
daughters
born
to
david
5
14
and
these
be
the
names
of
those
that
were
born
unto
him
in
jerusalem
shammuah
and
shobab
and
nathan
and
solomon
5
15
ibhar
also
and
elishua
and
nepheg
and
japhia
5
16
and
elishama
and
eliada
and
eliphalet
5
17
but
when
the
philistines
heard
that
they
had
anointed
david
king
over
israel
all
the
philistines
came
up
to
seek
david
and
david
heard
of
it
and
went
down
to
the
hold
5
18
the
philistines
also
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
5
19
and
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
up
to
the
philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
go
up
for
i
will
doubtless
deliver
the
philistines
into
thine
hand
5
20
and
david
came
to
baalperazim
and
david
smote
them
there
and
said
the
lord
hath
broken
forth
upon
mine
enemies
before
me
as
the
breach
of
waters
therefore
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
baalperazim
5
21
and
there
they
left
their
images
and
david
and
his
men
burned
them
5
22
and
the
philistines
came
up
yet
again
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
5
23
and
when
david
enquired
of
the
lord
he
said
thou
shalt
not
go
up
but
fetch
a
compass
behind
them
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees
5
24
and
let
it
be
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
thyself
for
then
shall
the
lord
go
out
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
philistines
5
25
and
david
did
so
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
smote
the
philistines
from
geba
until
thou
come
to
gazer
6
1
again
david
gathered
together
all
the
chosen
men
of
israel
thirty
thousand
6
2
and
david
arose
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
baale
of
judah
to
bring
up
from
thence
the
ark
of
god
whose
name
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims
6
3
and
they
set
the
ark
of
god
upon
a
new
cart
and
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
that
was
in
gibeah
and
uzzah
and
ahio
the
sons
of
abinadab
drave
the
new
cart
6
4
and
they
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
which
was
at
gibeah
accompanying
the
ark
of
god
and
ahio
went
before
the
ark
6
5
and
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
played
before
the
lord
on
all
manner
of
instruments
made
of
fir
wood
even
on
harps
and
on
psalteries
and
on
timbrels
and
on
cornets
and
on
cymbals
6
6
and
when
they
came
to
nachon’s
threshingfloor
uzzah
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
ark
of
god
and
took
hold
of
it
for
the
oxen
shook
it
6
7
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
uzzah
and
god
smote
him
there
for
his
error
and
there
he
died
by
the
ark
of
god
6
8
and
david
was
displeased
because
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
upon
uzzah
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
perezuzzah
to
this
day
6
9
and
david
was
afraid
of
the
lord
that
day
and
said
how
shall
the
ark
of
the
lord
come
to
me
6
10
so
david
would
not
remove
the
ark
of
the
lord
unto
him
into
the
city
of
david
but
david
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
6
11
and
the
ark
of
the
lord
continued
in
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
three
months
and
the
lord
blessed
obededom
and
all
his
household
6
12
and
it
was
told
king
david
saying
the
lord
hath
blessed
the
house
of
obededom
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
him
because
of
the
ark
of
god
so
david
went
and
brought
up
the
ark
of
god
from
the
house
of
obededom
into
the
city
of
david
with
gladness
6
13
and
it
was
so
that
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
lord
had
gone
six
paces
he
sacrificed
oxen
and
fatlings
6
14
and
david
danced
before
the
lord
with
all
his
might
and
david
was
girded
with
a
linen
ephod
6
15
so
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
with
shouting
and
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
6
16
and
as
the
ark
of
the
lord
came
into
the
city
of
david
michal
saul’s
daughter
looked
through
a
window
and
saw
king
david
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
lord
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart
6
17
and
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
set
it
in
his
place
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
david
had
pitched
for
it
and
david
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
6
18
and
as
soon
as
david
had
made
an
end
of
offering
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
6
19
and
he
dealt
among
all
the
people
even
among
the
whole
multitude
of
israel
as
well
to
the
women
as
men
to
every
one
a
cake
of
bread
and
a
good
piece
of
flesh
and
a
flagon
of
wine
so
all
the
people
departed
every
one
to
his
house
6
20
then
david
returned
to
bless
his
household
and
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
came
out
to
meet
david
and
said
how
glorious
was
the
king
of
israel
to
day
who
uncovered
himself
to
day
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
servants
as
one
of
the
vain
fellows
shamelessly
uncovereth
himself
6
21
and
david
said
unto
michal
it
was
before
the
lord
which
chose
me
before
thy
father
and
before
all
his
house
to
appoint
me
ruler
over
the
people
of
the
lord
over
israel
therefore
will
i
play
before
the
lord
6
22
and
i
will
yet
be
more
vile
than
thus
and
will
be
base
in
mine
own
sight
and
of
the
maidservants
which
thou
hast
spoken
of
of
them
shall
i
be
had
in
honour
6
23
therefore
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
death
7
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
sat
in
his
house
and
the
lord
had
given
him
rest
round
about
from
all
his
enemies
7
2
that
the
king
said
unto
nathan
the
prophet
see
now
i
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedar
but
the
ark
of
god
dwelleth
within
curtains
7
3
and
nathan
said
to
the
king
go
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
for
the
lord
is
with
thee
7
4
and
it
came
to
pass
that
night
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
nathan
saying
7
5
go
and
tell
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
shalt
thou
build
me
an
house
for
me
to
dwell
in
7
6
whereas
i
have
not
dwelt
in
any
house
since
the
time
that
i
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
even
to
this
day
but
have
walked
in
a
tent
and
in
a
tabernacle
7
7
in
all
the
places
wherein
i
have
walked
with
all
the
children
of
israel
spake
i
a
word
with
any
of
the
tribes
of
israel
whom
i
commanded
to
feed
my
people
israel
saying
why
build
ye
not
me
an
house
of
cedar
7
8
now
therefore
so
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote
from
following
the
sheep
to
be
ruler
over
my
people
over
israel
7
9
and
i
was
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wentest
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
out
of
thy
sight
and
have
made
thee
a
great
name
like
unto
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
earth
7
10
moreover
i
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
israel
and
will
plant
them
that
they
may
dwell
in
a
place
of
their
own
and
move
no
more
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
afflict
them
any
more
as
beforetime
7
11
and
as
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
israel
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
also
the
lord
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
house
7
12
and
when
thy
days
be
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
i
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
thee
which
shall
proceed
out
of
thy
bowels
and
i
will
establish
his
kingdom
7
13
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
i
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
ever
7
14
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
if
he
commit
iniquity
i
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of
men
and
with
the
stripes
of
the
children
of
men
7
15
but
my
mercy
shall
not
depart
away
from
him
as
i
took
it
from
saul
whom
i
put
away
before
thee
7
16
and
thine
house
and
thy
kingdom
shall
be
established
for
ever
before
thee
thy
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever
7
17
according
to
all
these
words
and
according
to
all
this
vision
so
did
nathan
speak
unto
david
7
18
then
went
king
david
in
and
sat
before
the
lord
and
he
said
who
am
i
o
lord
god
and
what
is
my
house
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto
7
19
and
this
was
yet
a
small
thing
in
thy
sight
o
lord
god
but
thou
hast
spoken
also
of
thy
servant’s
house
for
a
great
while
to
come
and
is
this
the
manner
of
man
o
lord
god
7
20
and
what
can
david
say
more
unto
thee
for
thou
lord
god
knowest
thy
servant
7
21
for
thy
word’s
sake
and
according
to
thine
own
heart
hast
thou
done
all
these
great
things
to
make
thy
servant
know
them
7
22
wherefore
thou
art
great
o
lord
god
for
there
is
none
like
thee
neither
is
there
any
god
beside
thee
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
7
23
and
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
even
like
israel
whom
god
went
to
redeem
for
a
people
to
himself
and
to
make
him
a
name
and
to
do
for
you
great
things
and
terrible
for
thy
land
before
thy
people
which
thou
redeemedst
to
thee
from
egypt
from
the
nations
and
their
gods
7
24
for
thou
hast
confirmed
to
thyself
thy
people
israel
to
be
a
people
unto
thee
for
ever
and
thou
lord
art
become
their
god
7
25
and
now
o
lord
god
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
establish
it
for
ever
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
7
26
and
let
thy
name
be
magnified
for
ever
saying
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
god
over
israel
and
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
david
be
established
before
thee
7
27
for
thou
o
lord
of
hosts
god
of
israel
hast
revealed
to
thy
servant
saying
i
will
build
thee
an
house
therefore
hath
thy
servant
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
this
prayer
unto
thee
7
28
and
now
o
lord
god
thou
art
that
god
and
thy
words
be
true
and
thou
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant
7
29
therefore
now
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant
that
it
may
continue
for
ever
before
thee
for
thou
o
lord
god
hast
spoken
it
and
with
thy
blessing
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
be
blessed
for
ever
8

and
after
this
it
came
to
pass
that
david
smote
the
philistines
and
subdued
them
and
david
took
methegammah
out
of
the

and
he
smote
moab
and
measured
them
with
a
line
casting
them
down
to
the
ground
even
with
two
lines
measured
he
to
put
to
death
and
with
one
full
line
to
keep
alive
and
so
the
moabites
became
david’s
servants
and
brought
gifts
8

david
smote
also
hadadezer
the
son
of
rehob
king
of
zobah
as
he
went
to
recover
his
border
at
the
river
euphrates
8

and
david
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots
and
seven
hundred
horsemen
and
twenty
thousand
footmen
and
david
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses
but
reserved
of
them
for
an
hundred
chariots
8
5
and
when
the
syrians
of
damascus
came
to
succour
hadadezer
king
of
zobah
david
slew
of
the
syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men
8
6
then
david
put
garrisons
in
syria
of
damascus
and
the
syrians
became
servants
to
david
and
brought
gifts
and
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
8
7
and
david
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
hadadezer
and
brought
them
to
jerusalem
8

and
from
betah
and
from
berothai
cities
of
hadadezer
king
david
took
exceeding
much
brass
8
9
when
toi
king
of
hamath
heard
that
david
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
hadadezer
8
10
then
toi
sent
joram
his
son
unto
king
david
to
salute
him
and
to
bless
him
because
he
had
fought
against
hadadezer
and
smitten
him
for
hadadezer
had
wars
with
toi
and
joram
brought
with
him
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
and
vessels
of
brass
8
11
which
also
king
david
did
dedicate

the
lord
with
the
silver
and
gold
that
he
had
dedicated
of
all
nations
which
he
subdued

and
of
the
children
of

and
of
the
philistines
and
of
amalek
and
of
the
spoil
of
hadadezer
son
of
rehob
king
of
zobah
8
13
and
david
gat
him
a
name
when
he
returned
from
smiting
of
the
syrians
in
the
valley
of
salt
being
eighteen
thousand
men
8
14
and
he
put
garrisons
in
edom
throughout
all
edom
put
he
garrisons
and
all
they
of
edom
became
david’s
servants
and
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
8
15
and
david
reigned
over
all
israel
and
david
executed
judgment
and
justice
unto
all
his
people
8
16
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
over
the
host
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
was
recorder
8

and

was
over
both
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
david’s
sons
were
chief
rulers
9

and
david
said
is
there
yet
any
that
is
left
of
the
house
of
saul
that
i
may
shew
him
kindness
for
jonathan’s
sake
9
2
and
there
was
of
the
house
of
saul
a
servant
whose
name
was
ziba
and
when
they
had
called
him
unto
david
the
king
said
unto
him
art
thou
ziba
and
he
said
thy
servant
is
he
9
3
and
the
king
said
is
there
not
yet
any
of
the
house
of
saul
that
i
may
shew
the
kindness
of
god
unto
him
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
jonathan
hath
yet
a
son
which
is
lame
on
his
feet
9
4
and
the
king
said
unto
him
where
is
he
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
behold
he
is
in
the
house
of
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
in
lodebar
9
5
then
king
david
sent
and
fetched
him
out
of
the
house
of
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
from
lodebar
9
6
now
when
mephibosheth
the
son
of
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
was
come
unto
david
he
fell
on
his
face
and
did
reverence
and
david
said
mephibosheth
and
he
answered
behold
thy
servant
9
7
and
david
said
unto
him
fear
not
for
i
will
surely
shew
thee
kindness
for
jonathan
thy
father’s
sake
and
will
restore
thee
all
the
land
of
saul
thy
father
and
thou
shalt
eat
bread
at
my
table
continually
9
8
and
he
bowed
himself
and
said
what
is
thy
servant
that
thou
shouldest
look
upon
such
a
dead
dog
as
i
am
9
9
then
the
king
called
to
ziba
saul’s
servant
and
said
unto
him
i
have
given
unto
thy
master’s
son
all
that
pertained
to
saul
and
to
all
his
house
9
10
thou
therefore
and
thy
sons
and
thy
servants
shall
till
the
land
for
him
and
thou
shalt
bring
in
the
fruits
that
thy
master’s
son
may
have
food
to
eat
but
mephibosheth
thy
master’s
son
shall
eat
bread
alway
at
my
table
now
ziba
had
fifteen
sons
and
twenty
servants
9
11
then
said
ziba
unto
the
king
according
to
all
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
commanded
his
servant
so
shall
thy
servant
do
as
for
mephibosheth
said
the
king
he
shall
eat
at
my
table
as
one
of
the
king’s
sons
9
12
and
mephibosheth
had
a
young
son
whose
name
was
micha
and
all
that
dwelt
in
the
house
of
ziba
were
servants
unto
mephibosheth
9
13
so
mephibosheth
dwelt
in
jerusalem
for
he
did
eat
continually
at
the
king’s
table
and
was
lame
on
both
his
feet
10
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
died
and
hanun
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
10
2
then
said
david
i
will
shew
kindness
unto
hanun
the
son
of
nahash
as
his
father
shewed
kindness
unto
me
and
david
sent
to
comfort
him
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
for
his
father
and
david’s
servants
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
10
3
and
the
princes
of
the
children
of
ammon
said
unto
hanun
their
lord
thinkest
thou
that
david
doth
honour
thy
father
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee
hath
not
david
rather
sent
his
servants
unto
thee
to
search
the
city
and
to
spy
it
out
and
to
overthrow
it
10
4
wherefore
hanun
took
david’s
servants
and
shaved
off
the
one
half
of
their
beards
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
middle
even
to
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
10
5
when
they
told
it
unto
david
he
sent
to
meet
them
because
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed
and
the
king
said
tarry
at
jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown
and
then
return
10
6
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
they
stank
before
david
the
children
of
ammon
sent
and
hired
the
syrians
of
bethrehob
and
the
syrians
of
zoba
twenty
thousand
footmen
and
of
king
maacah
a
thousand
men
and
of
ishtob
twelve
thousand
men
10
7
and
when
david
heard
of
it
he
sent
joab
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men
10
8
and
the
children
of
ammon
came
out
and
put
the
battle
in
array
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
and
the
syrians
of
zoba
and
of
rehob
and
ishtob
and
maacah
were
by
themselves
in
the
field
10
9
when
joab
saw
that
the
front
of
the
battle
was
against
him
before
and
behind
he
chose
of
all
the
choice
men
of
israel
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
syrians
10
10
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
into
the
hand
of
abishai
his
brother
that
he
might
put
them
in
array
against
the
children
of
ammon
10
11
and
he
said
if
the
syrians
be
too
strong
for
me
then
thou
shalt
help
me
but
if
the
children
of
ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee
then
i
will
come
and
help
thee
10
12
be
of
good
courage
and
let
us
play
the
men
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
god
and
the
lord
do
that
which
seemeth
him
good
10
13
and
joab
drew
nigh
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
unto
the
battle
against
the
syrians
and
they
fled
before
him
10
14
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
the
syrians
were
fled
then
fled
they
also
before
abishai
and
entered
into
the
city
so
joab
returned
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
came
to
jerusalem
10
15
and
when
the
syrians
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
israel
they
gathered
themselves
together
10
16
and
hadarezer
sent
and
brought
out
the
syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river
and
they
came
to
helam
and
shobach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
hadarezer
went
before
them
10
17
and
when
it
was
told
david
he
gathered
all
israel
together
and
passed
over
jordan
and
came
to
helam
and
the
syrians
set
themselves
in
array
against
david
and
fought
with
him
10
18
and
the
syrians
fled
before
israel
and
david
slew
the
men
of
seven
hundred
chariots
of
the
syrians
and
forty
thousand
horsemen
and
smote
shobach
the
captain
of
their
host
who
died
there
10
19
and
when
all
the
kings
that
were
servants
to
hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
israel
they
made
peace
with
israel
and
served
them
so
the
syrians
feared
to
help
the
children
of
ammon
any
more
11
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
the
year
was
expired
at
the
time
when
kings
go
forth
to
battle
that
david
sent
joab
and
his
servants
with
him
and
all
israel
and
they
destroyed
the
children
of
ammon
and
besieged
rabbah
but
david
tarried
still
at
jerusalem
11
2
and
it
came
to
pass
in
an
eveningtide
that
david
arose
from
off
his
bed
and
walked
upon
the
roof
of
the
king’s
house
and
from
the
roof
he
saw
a
woman
washing
herself
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
to
look
upon
11
3
and
david
sent
and
enquired
after
the
woman
and
one
said
is
not
this
bathsheba
the
daughter
of
eliam
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
11
4
and
david
sent
messengers
and
took
her
and
she
came
in
unto
him
and
he
lay
with
her
for
she
was
purified
from
her
uncleanness
and
she
returned
unto
her
house
11
5
and
the
woman
conceived
and
sent
and
told
david
and
said
i
am
with
child
11
6
and
david
sent
to
joab
saying
send
me
uriah
the
hittite
and
joab
sent
uriah
to
david
11
7
and
when
uriah
was
come
unto
him
david
demanded
of
him
how
joab
did
and
how
the
people
did
and
how
the
war
prospered
11
8
and
david
said
to
uriah
go
down
to
thy
house
and
wash
thy
feet
and
uriah
departed
out
of
the
king’s
house
and
there
followed
him
a
mess
of
meat
from
the

but
uriah
slept
at
the
door
of
the
king’s
house
with
all
the
servants
of
his
lord
and
went
not
down
to
his
house
11
10
and
when
they
had
told
david
saying
uriah
went
not
down
unto
his
house
david
said
unto
uriah
camest
thou
not
from
thy
journey
why
then
didst
thou
not
go
down
unto
thine
house
11
11
and
uriah
said
unto
david
the
ark
and
israel
and
judah
abide
in
tents
and
my
lord
joab
and
the
servants
of
my
lord
are
encamped
in
the
open
fields
shall
i
then
go
into
mine
house
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
lie
with
my
wife
as
thou
livest
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
do
this
thing
11
12
and
david
said
to
uriah
tarry
here
to
day
also
and
to
morrow
i
will
let
thee
depart
so
uriah
abode
in
jerusalem
that
day
and
the
morrow
11
13
and
when
david
had
called
him
he
did
eat
and
drink
before
him
and
he
made
him
drunk
and
at
even
he
went
out
to
lie
on
his
bed
with
the
servants
of
his
lord
but
went
not
down
to
his
house
11
14
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
david
wrote
a
letter
to
joab
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
uriah
11
15
and
he
wrote
in
the
letter
saying
set
ye
uriah
in
the
forefront
of
the
hottest
battle
and
retire
ye
from
him
that
he
may
be
smitten
and
die
11
16
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joab
observed
the
city
that
he
assigned
uriah
unto
a
place
where
he
knew
that
valiant
men
were
11
17
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
and
fought
with
joab
and
there
fell
some
of
the
people
of
the
servants
of
david
and
uriah
the
hittite
died
also
11
18
then
joab
sent
and
told
david
all
the
things
concerning
the
war
11
19
and
charged
the
messenger
saying
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
telling
the
matters
of
the
war
unto
the
king
11
20
and
if
so
be
that
the
king’s
wrath
arise
and
he
say
unto
thee
wherefore
approached
ye
so
nigh
unto
the
city
when
ye
did
fight
knew
ye
not
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
wall
11
21
who
smote
abimelech
the
son
of
jerubbesheth
did
not
a
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
him
from
the
wall
that
he
died
in
thebez
why
went
ye
nigh
the
wall
then
say
thou
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
also
11
22
so
the
messenger
went
and
came
and
shewed
david
all
that
joab
had
sent
him
for
11
23
and
the
messenger
said
unto
david
surely
the
men
prevailed
against
us
and
came
out
unto
us
into
the
field
and
we
were
upon
them
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate
11
24
and
the
shooters
shot
from
off
the
wall
upon
thy
servants
and
some
of
the
king’s
servants
be
dead
and
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
also
11
25
then
david
said
unto
the
messenger
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
joab
let
not
this
thing
displease
thee
for
the
sword
devoureth
one
as
well
as
another
make
thy
battle
more
strong
against
the
city
and
overthrow
it
and
encourage
thou
him
11
26
and
when
the
wife
of
uriah
heard
that
uriah
her
husband
was
dead
she
mourned
for
her
husband
11
27
and
when
the
mourning
was
past
david
sent
and
fetched
her
to
his
house
and
she
became
his
wife
and
bare
him
a
son
but
the
thing
that
david
had
done
displeased
the
lord
12
1
and
the
lord
sent
nathan
unto
david
and
he
came
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
there
were
two
men
in
one
city
the
one
rich
and
the
other
poor
12
2
the
rich
man
had
exceeding
many
flocks
and
herds
12
3
but
the
poor
man
had
nothing
save
one
little
ewe
lamb
which
he
had
bought
and
nourished
up
and
it
grew
up
together
with
him
and
with
his
children
it
did
eat
of
his
own
meat
and
drank
of
his
own
cup
and
lay
in
his
bosom
and
was
unto
him
as
a
daughter
12
4
and
there
came
a
traveller
unto
the
rich
man
and
he
spared
to
take
of
his
own
flock
and
of
his
own
herd
to
dress
for
the
wayfaring
man
that
was
come
unto
him
but
took
the
poor
man’s
lamb
and
dressed
it
for
the
man
that
was
come
to
him
12
5
and
david’s
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
the
man
and
he
said
to
nathan
as
the
lord
liveth
the
man
that
hath
done
this
thing
shall
surely
die
12
6
and
he
shall
restore
the
lamb
fourfold
because
he
did
this
thing
and
because
he
had
no
pity
12
7
and
nathan
said
to
david
thou
art
the
man
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
and
i
delivered
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
saul
12
8
and
i
gave
thee
thy
master’s
house
and
thy
master’s
wives
into
thy
bosom
and
gave
thee
the
house
of
israel
and
of
judah
and
if
that
had
been
too
little
i
would
moreover
have
given
unto
thee
such
and
such
things
12
9
wherefore
hast
thou
despised
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
do
evil
in
his
sight
thou
hast
killed
uriah
the
hittite
with
the
sword
and
hast
taken
his
wife
to
be
thy
wife
and
hast
slain
him
with
the
sword
of
the
children
of
ammon
12
10
now
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thine
house
because
thou
hast
despised
me
and
hast
taken
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
to
be
thy
wife
12
11
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
raise
up
evil
against
thee
out
of
thine
own
house
and
i
will
take
thy
wives
before
thine
eyes
and
give
them
unto
thy
neighbour
and
he
shall
lie
with
thy
wives
in
the
sight
of
this
sun
12
12
for
thou
didst
it
secretly
but
i
will
do
this
thing
before
all
israel
and
before
the
sun
12
13
and
david
said
unto
nathan
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
nathan
said
unto
david
the
lord
also
hath
put
away
thy
sin
thou
shalt
not
die
12
14
howbeit
because
by
this
deed
thou
hast
given
great
occasion
to
the
enemies
of
the
lord
to
blaspheme
the
child
also
that
is
born
unto
thee
shall
surely
die
12
15
and
nathan
departed
unto
his
house
and
the
lord
struck
the
child
that
uriah’s
wife
bare
unto
david
and
it
was
very
sick
12
16
david
therefore
besought
god
for
the
child
and
david
fasted
and
went
in
and
lay
all
night
upon
the
earth
12
17
and
the
elders
of
his
house
arose
and
went
to
him
to
raise
him
up
from
the
earth
but
he
would
not
neither
did
he
eat
bread
with
them
12
18
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
the
child
died
and
the
servants
of
david
feared
to
tell
him
that
the
child
was
dead
for
they
said
behold
while
the
child
was
yet
alive
we
spake
unto
him
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
our
voice
how
will
he
then
vex
himself
if
we
tell
him
that
the
child
is
dead
12
19
but
when
david
saw
that
his
servants
whispered
david
perceived
that
the
child
was
dead
therefore
david
said
unto
his
servants
is
the
child
dead
and
they
said
he
is
dead
12
20
then
david
arose
from
the
earth
and
washed
and
anointed
himself
and
changed
his
apparel
and
came
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
worshipped
then
he
came
to
his
own
house
and
when
he
required
they
set
bread
before
him
and
he
did
eat
12
21
then
said
his
servants
unto
him
what
thing
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
thou
didst
fast
and
weep
for
the
child
while
it
was
alive
but
when
the
child
was
dead
thou
didst
rise
and
eat
bread
12
22
and
he
said
while
the
child
was
yet
alive
i
fasted
and
wept
for
i
said
who
can
tell
whether
god
will
be
gracious
to
me
that
the
child
may
live
12
23
but
now
he
is
dead
wherefore
should
i
fast
can
i
bring
him
back
again
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me
12
24
and
david
comforted
bathsheba
his
wife
and
went
in
unto
her
and
lay
with
her
and
she
bare
a
son
and
he
called
his
name
solomon
and
the
lord
loved
him
12
25
and
he
sent
by
the
hand
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
he
called
his
name
jedidiah
because
of
the
lord
12
26
and
joab
fought
against
rabbah
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
took
the
royal
city
12
27
and
joab
sent
messengers
to
david
and
said
i
have
fought
against
rabbah
and
have
taken
the
city
of
waters
12
28
now
therefore
gather
the
rest
of
the
people
together
and
encamp
against
the
city
and
take
it
lest
i
take
the
city
and
it
be
called
after
my
name
12
29
and
david
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
went
to
rabbah
and
fought
against
it
and
took
it
12
30
and
he
took
their
king’s
crown
from
off
his
head
the
weight
whereof
was
a
talent
of
gold
with
the
precious
stones
and
it
was
set
on
david’s
head
and
he
brought
forth
the
spoil
of
the
city
in
great
abundance
12
31
and
he
brought
forth
the
people
that
were
therein
and
put
them
under
saws
and
under
harrows
of
iron
and
under
axes
of
iron
and
made
them
pass
through
the
brick-kiln
and
thus
did
he
unto
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
ammon
so
david
and
all
the
people
returned
unto
jerusalem
13
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
absalom
the
son
of
david
had
a
fair
sister
whose
name
was
tamar
and
amnon
the
son
of
david
loved
her
13
2
and
amnon
was
so
vexed
that
he
fell
sick
for
his
sister
tamar
for
she
was
a
virgin
and
amnon
thought
it
hard
for
him
to
do
anything
to
her
13
3
but
amnon
had
a
friend
whose
name
was
jonadab
the
son
of
shimeah
david’s
brother
and
jonadab
was
a
very
subtil
man
13
4
and
he
said
unto
him
why
art
thou
being
the
king’s
son
lean
from
day
to
day
wilt
thou
not
tell
me
and
amnon
said
unto
him
i
love
tamar
my
brother
absalom’s
sister
13
5
and
jonadab
said
unto
him
lay
thee
down
on
thy
bed
and
make
thyself
sick
and
when
thy
father
cometh
to
see
thee
say
unto
him
i
pray
thee
let
my
sister
tamar
come
and
give
me
meat
and
dress
the
meat
in
my
sight
that
i
may
see
it
and
eat
it
at
her
hand
13
6
so
amnon
lay
down
and
made
himself
sick
and
when
the
king
was
come
to
see
him
amnon
said
unto
the
king
i
pray
thee
let
tamar
my
sister
come
and
make
me
a
couple
of
cakes
in
my
sight
that
i
may
eat
at
her
hand
13
7
then
david
sent
home
to
tamar
saying
go
now
to
thy
brother
amnon’s
house
and
dress
him
meat
13
8
so
tamar
went
to
her
brother
amnon’s
house
and
he
was
laid
down
and
she
took
flour
and
kneaded
it
and
made
cakes
in
his
sight
and
did
bake
the
cakes
13
9
and
she
took
a
pan
and
poured
them
out
before
him
but
he
refused
to
eat
and
amnon
said
have
out
all
men
from
me
and
they
went
out
every
man
from
him
13
10
and
amnon
said
unto
tamar
bring
the
meat
into
the
chamber
that
i
may
eat
of
thine
hand
and
tamar
took
the
cakes
which
she
had
made
and
brought
them
into
the
chamber
to
amnon
her
brother
13
11
and
when
she
had
brought
them
unto
him
to
eat
he
took
hold
of
her
and
said
unto
her
come
lie
with
me
my
sister
13
12
and
she
answered
him
nay
my
brother
do
not
force
me
for
no
such
thing
ought
to
be
done
in
israel
do
not
thou
this
folly
13
13
and
i
whither
shall
i
cause
my
shame
to
go
and
as
for
thee
thou
shalt
be
as
one
of
the
fools
in
israel
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
speak
unto
the
king
for
he
will
not
withhold
me
from
thee
13
14
howbeit
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
voice
but
being
stronger
than
she
forced
her
and
lay
with
her
13
15
then
amnon
hated
her
exceedingly
so
that
the
hatred
wherewith
he
hated
her
was
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
he
had
loved
her
and
amnon
said
unto
her
arise
be
gone
13
16
and
she
said
unto
him
there
is
no
cause
this
evil
in
sending
me
away
is
greater
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
me
but
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
13
17
then
he
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
him
and
said
put
now
this
woman
out
from
me
and
bolt
the
door
after
her
13
18
and
she
had
a
garment
of
divers
colours
upon
her
for
with
such
robes
were
the
king’s
daughters
that
were
virgins
apparelled
then
his
servant
brought
her
out
and
bolted
the
door
after
her
13
19
and
tamar
put
ashes
on
her
head
and
rent
her
garment
of
divers
colours
that
was
on
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
head
and
went
on
crying
13
20
and
absalom
her
brother
said
unto
her
hath
amnon
thy
brother
been
with
thee
but
hold
now
thy
peace
my
sister
he
is
thy
brother
regard
not
this
thing
so
tamar
remained
desolate
in
her
brother
absalom’s
house
13
21
but
when
king
david
heard
of
all
these
things
he
was
very
wroth
13
22
and
absalom
spake
unto
his
brother
amnon
neither
good
nor
bad
for
absalom
hated
amnon
because
he
had
forced
his
sister
tamar
13
23
and
it
came
to
pass
after
two
full
years
that
absalom
had
sheepshearers
in
baalhazor
which
is
beside
ephraim
and
absalom
invited
all
the
king’s
sons
13
24
and
absalom
came
to
the
king
and
said
behold
now
thy
servant
hath
sheepshearers
let
the
king
i
beseech
thee
and
his
servants
go
with
thy
servant
13
25
and
the
king
said
to
absalom
nay
my
son
let
us
not
all
now
go
lest
we
be
chargeable
unto
thee
and
he
pressed
him
howbeit
he
would
not
go
but
blessed
him
13
26
then
said
absalom
if
not
i
pray
thee
let
my
brother
amnon
go
with
us
and
the
king
said
unto
him
why
should
he
go
with
thee
13
27
but
absalom
pressed
him
that
he
let
amnon
and
all
the
king’s
sons
go
with
him
13
28
now
absalom
had
commanded
his
servants
saying
mark
ye
now
when
amnon’s
heart
is
merry
with
wine
and
when
i
say
unto
you
smite
amnon
then
kill
him
fear
not
have
not
i
commanded
you
be
courageous
and
be
valiant
13
29
and
the
servants
of
absalom
did
unto
amnon
as
absalom
had
commanded
then
all
the
king’s
sons
arose
and
every
man
gat
him
up
upon
his
mule
and
fled
13
30
and
it
came
to
pass
while
they
were
in
the
way
that
tidings
came
to
david
saying
absalom
hath
slain
all
the
king’s
sons
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
left
13
31
then
the
king
arose
and
tare
his
garments
and
lay
on
the
earth
and
all
his
servants
stood
by
with
their
clothes
rent
13
32
and
jonadab
the
son
of
shimeah
david’s
brother
answered
and
said
let
not
my
lord
suppose
that
they
have
slain
all
the
young
men
the
king’s
sons
for
amnon
only
is
dead
for
by
the
appointment
of
absalom
this
hath
been
determined
from
the
day
that
he
forced
his
sister
tamar
13
33
now
therefore
let
not
my
lord
the
king
take
the
thing
to
his
heart
to
think
that
all
the
king’s
sons
are
dead
for
amnon
only
is
dead
13
34
but
absalom
fled
and
the
young
man
that
kept
the
watch
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
came
much
people
by
the
way
of
the
hill
side
behind
him
13
35
and
jonadab
said
unto
the
king
behold
the
king’s
sons
come
as
thy
servant
said
so
it
is
13
36
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
that
behold
the
king’s
sons
came
and
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
the
king
also
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
sore
13
37
but
absalom
fled
and
went
to
talmai
the
son
of
ammihud
king
of
geshur
and
david
mourned
for
his
son
every
day
13
38
so
absalom
fled
and
went
to
geshur
and
was
there
three
years
13
39
and
the
soul
of
king
david
longed
to
go
forth
unto
absalom
for
he
was
comforted
concerning
amnon
seeing
he
was
dead
14
1
now
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
perceived
that
the
king’s
heart
was
toward
absalom
14
2
and
joab
sent
to
tekoah
and
fetched
thence
a
wise
woman
and
said
unto
her
i
pray
thee
feign
thyself
to
be
a
mourner
and
put
on
now
mourning
apparel
and
anoint
not
thyself
with
oil
but
be
as
a
woman
that
had
a
long
time
mourned
for
the
dead
14
3
and
come
to
the
king
and
speak
on
this
manner
unto
him
so
joab
put
the
words
in
her
mouth
14
4
and
when
the
woman
of
tekoah
spake
to
the
king
she
fell
on
her
face
to
the
ground
and
did
obeisance
and
said
help
o
king
14
5
and
the
king
said
unto
her
what
aileth
thee
and
she
answered
i
am
indeed
a
widow
woman
and
mine
husband
is
dead
14
6
and
thy
handmaid
had
two
sons
and
they
two
strove
together
in
the
field
and
there
was
none
to
part
them
but
the
one
smote
the
other
and
slew
him
14
7
and
behold
the
whole
family
is
risen
against
thine
handmaid
and
they
said
deliver
him
that
smote
his
brother
that
we
may
kill
him
for
the
life
of
his
brother
whom
he
slew
and
we
will
destroy
the
heir
also
and
so
they
shall
quench
my
coal
which
is
left
and
shall
not
leave
to
my
husband
neither
name
nor
remainder
upon
the
earth
14
8
and
the
king
said
unto
the
woman
go
to
thine
house
and
i
will
give
charge
concerning
thee
14
9
and
the
woman
of
tekoah
said
unto
the
king
my
lord
o
king
the
iniquity
be
on
me
and
on
my
father’s
house
and
the
king
and
his
throne
be
guiltless
14
10
and
the
king
said
whoever
saith
ought
unto
thee
bring
him
to
me
and
he
shall
not
touch
thee
any
more
14
11
then
said
she
i
pray
thee
let
the
king
remember
the
lord
thy
god
that
thou
wouldest
not
suffer
the
revengers
of
blood
to
destroy
any
more
lest
they
destroy
my
son
and
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
thy
son
fall
to
the
earth
14
12
then
the
woman
said
let
thine
handmaid
i
pray
thee
speak
one
word
unto
my
lord
the
king
and
he
said
say
on
14
13
and
the
woman
said
wherefore
then
hast
thou
thought
such
a
thing
against
the
people
of
god
for
the
king
doth
speak
this
thing
as
one
which
is
faulty
in
that
the
king
doth
not
fetch
home
again
his
banished
14
14
for
we
must
needs
die
and
are
as
water
spilt
on
the
ground
which
cannot
be
gathered
up
again
neither
doth
god
respect
any
person
yet
doth
he
devise
means
that
his
banished
be
not
expelled
from
him
14
15
now
therefore
that
i
am
come
to
speak
of
this
thing
unto
my
lord
the
king
it
is
because
the
people
have
made
me
afraid
and
thy
handmaid
said
i
will
now
speak
unto
the
king
it
may
be
that
the
king
will
perform
the
request
of
his
handmaid
14
16
for
the
king
will
hear
to
deliver
his
handmaid
out
of
the
hand
of
the
man
that
would
destroy
me
and
my
son
together
out
of
the
inheritance
of
god
14
17
then
thine
handmaid
said
the
word
of
my
lord
the
king
shall
now
be
comfortable
for
as
an
angel
of
god
so
is
my
lord
the
king
to
discern
good
and
bad
therefore
the
lord
thy
god
will
be
with
thee
14
18
then
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
woman
hide
not
from
me
i
pray
thee
the
thing
that
i
shall
ask
thee
and
the
woman
said
let
my
lord
the
king
now
speak
14
19
and
the
king
said
is
not
the
hand
of
joab
with
thee
in
all
this
and
the
woman
answered
and
said
as
thy
soul
liveth
my
lord
the
king
none
can
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
from
ought
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
spoken
for
thy
servant
joab
he
bade
me
and
he
put
all
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
thine
handmaid
14
20
to
fetch
about
this
form
of
speech
hath
thy
servant
joab
done
this
thing
and
my
lord
is
wise
according
to
the
wisdom
of
an
angel
of
god
to
know
all
things
that
are
in
the
earth
14
21
and
the
king
said
unto
joab
behold
now
i
have
done
this
thing
go
therefore
bring
the
young
man
absalom
again
14
22
and
joab
fell
to
the
ground
on
his
face
and
bowed
himself
and
thanked
the
king
and
joab
said
to
day
thy
servant
knoweth
that
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
my
lord
o
king
in
that
the
king
hath
fulfilled
the
request
of
his
servant
14
23
so
joab
arose
and
went
to
geshur
and
brought
absalom
to
jerusalem
14
24
and
the
king
said
let
him
turn
to
his
own
house
and
let
him
not
see
my
face
so
absalom
returned
to
his
own
house
and
saw
not
the
king’s
face
14
25
but
in
all
israel
there
was
none
to
be
so
much
praised
as
absalom
for
his
beauty
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
even
to
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
no
blemish
in
him
14
26
and
when
he
polled
his
head
(for
it
was
at
every
year’s
end
that
he
polled
it
because
the
hair
was
heavy
on
him
therefore
he
polled
it
)
he
weighed
the
hair
of
his
head
at
two
hundred
shekels
after
the
king’s
weight
14
27
and
unto
absalom
there
were
born
three
sons
and
one
daughter
whose
name
was
tamar
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fair
countenance
14
28
so
absalom
dwelt
two
full
years
in
jerusalem
and
saw
not
the
king’s
face
14
29
therefore
absalom
sent
for
joab
to
have
sent
him
to
the
king
but
he
would
not
come
to
him
and
when
he
sent
again
the
second
time
he
would
not
come
14
30
therefore
he
said
unto
his
servants
see
joab’s
field
is
near
mine
and
he
hath
barley
there
go
and
set
it
on
fire
and
absalom’s
servants
set
the
field
on
fire
14
31
then
joab
arose
and
came
to
absalom
unto
his
house
and
said
unto
him
wherefore
have
thy
servants
set
my
field
on
fire
14
32
and
absalom
answered
joab
behold
i
sent
unto
thee
saying
come
hither
that
i
may
send
thee
to
the
king
to
say
wherefore
am
i
come
from
geshur
it
had
been
good
for
me
to
have
been
there
still
now
therefore
let
me
see
the
king’s
face
and
if
there
be
any
iniquity
in
me
let
him
kill
me
14
33
so
joab
came
to
the
king
and
told
him
and
when
he
had
called
for
absalom
he
came
to
the
king
and
bowed
himself
on
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
king
and
the
king
kissed
absalom
15
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
absalom
prepared
him
chariots
and
horses
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him
15
2
and
absalom
rose
up
early
and
stood
beside
the
way
of
the
gate
and
it
was
so
that
when
any
man
that
had
a
controversy
came
to
the
king
for
judgment
then
absalom
called
unto
him
and
said
of
what
city
art
thou
and
he
said
thy
servant
is
of
one
of
the
tribes
of
israel
15
3
and
absalom
said
unto
him
see
thy
matters
are
good
and
right
but
there
is
no
man
deputed
of
the
king
to
hear
thee
15
4
absalom
said
moreover
oh
that
i
were
made
judge
in
the
land
that
every
man
which
hath
any
suit
or
cause
might
come
unto
me
and
i
would
do
him
justice
15
5
and
it
was
so
that
when
any
man
came
nigh
to
him
to
do
him
obeisance
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
took
him
and
kissed
him
15
6
and
on
this
manner
did
absalom
to
all
israel
that
came
to
the
king
for
judgment
so
absalom
stole
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
israel
15
7
and
it
came
to
pass
after
forty
years
that
absalom
said
unto
the
king
i
pray
thee
let
me
go
and
pay
my
vow
which
i
have
vowed
unto
the
lord
in
hebron
15
8
for
thy
servant
vowed
a
vow
while
i
abode
at
geshur
in
syria
saying
if
the
lord
shall
bring
me
again
indeed
to
jerusalem
then
i
will
serve
the
lord
15
9
and
the
king
said
unto
him
go
in
peace
so
he
arose
and
went
to
hebron
15
10
but
absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
saying
as
soon
as
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
then
ye
shall
say
absalom
reigneth
in
hebron
15
11
and
with
absalom
went
two
hundred
men
out
of
jerusalem
that
were
called
and
they
went
in
their
simplicity
and
they
knew
not
any
thing
15
12
and
absalom
sent
for
ahithophel
the
gilonite
david’s
counsellor
from
his
city
even
from
giloh
while
he
offered
sacrifices
and
the
conspiracy
was
strong
for
the
people
increased
continually
with
absalom
15
13
and
there
came
a
messenger
to
david
saying
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
israel
are
after
absalom
15
14
and
david
said
unto
all
his
servants
that
were
with
him
at
jerusalem
arise
and
let
us
flee
for
we
shall
not
else
escape
from
absalom
make
speed
to
depart
lest
he
overtake
us
suddenly
and
bring
evil
upon
us
and
smite
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
15
15
and
the
king’s
servants
said
unto
the
king
behold
thy
servants
are
ready
to
do
whatsoever
my
lord
the
king
shall
appoint
15
16
and
the
king
went
forth
and
all
his
household
after
him
and
the
king
left
ten
women
which
were
concubines
to
keep
the
house
15
17
and
the
king
went
forth
and
all
the
people
after
him
and
tarried
in
a
place
that
was
far
off
15
18
and
all
his
servants
passed
on
beside
him
and
all
the
cherethites
and
all
the
pelethites
and
all
the
gittites
six
hundred
men
which
came
after
him
from
gath
passed
on
before
the
king
15
19
then
said
the
king
to
ittai
the
gittite
wherefore
goest
thou
also
with
us
return
to
thy
place
and
abide
with
the
king
for
thou
art
a
stranger
and
also
an
exile
15
20
whereas
thou
camest
but
yesterday
should
i
this
day
make
thee
go
up
and
down
with
us
seeing
i
go
whither
i
may
return
thou
and
take
back
thy
brethren
mercy
and
truth
be
with
thee
15
21
and
ittai
answered
the
king
and
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
my
lord
the
king
liveth
surely
in
what
place
my
lord
the
king
shall
be
whether
in
death
or
life
even
there
also
will
thy
servant
be
15
22
and
david
said
to
ittai
go
and
pass
over
and
ittai
the
gittite
passed
over
and
all
his
men
and
all
the
little
ones
that
were
with
him
15
23
and
all
the
country
wept
with
a
loud
voice
and
all
the
people
passed
over
the
king
also
himself
passed
over
the
brook
kidron
and
all
the
people
passed
over
toward
the
way
of
the
wilderness
15
24
and
lo
zadok
also
and
all
the
levites
were
with
him
bearing
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
and
they
set
down
the
ark
of
god
and
abiathar
went
up
until
all
the
people
had
done
passing
out
of
the
city
15
25
and
the
king
said
unto
zadok
carry
back
the
ark
of
god
into
the
city
if
i
shall
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
he
will
bring
me
again
and
shew
me
both
it
and
his
habitation
15
26
but
if
he
thus
say
i
have
no
delight
in
thee
behold
here
am
i
let
him
do
to
me
as
seemeth
good
unto
him
15
27
the
king
said
also
unto
zadok
the
priest
art
not
thou
a
seer
return
into
the
city
in
peace
and
your
two
sons
with
you
ahimaaz
thy
son
and
jonathan
the
son
of
abiathar
15
28
see
i
will
tarry
in
the
plain
of
the
wilderness
until
there
come
word
from
you
to
certify
me
15
29
zadok
therefore
and
abiathar
carried
the
ark
of
god
again
to
jerusalem
and
they
tarried
there
15
30
and
david
went
up
by
the
ascent
of
mount
olivet
and
wept
as
he
went
up
and
had
his
head
covered
and
he
went
barefoot
and
all
the
people
that
was
with
him
covered
every
man
his
head
and
they
went
up
weeping
as
they
went
up
15
31
and
one
told
david
saying
ahithophel
is
among
the
conspirators
with
absalom
and
david
said
o
lord
i
pray
thee
turn
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
into
foolishness
15
32
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
david
was
come
to
the
top
of
the
mount
where
he
worshipped
god
behold
hushai
the
archite
came
to
meet
him
with
his
coat
rent
and
earth
upon
his
head
15
33
unto
whom
david
said
if
thou
passest
on
with
me
then
thou
shalt
be
a
burden
unto
me
15
34
but
if
thou
return
to
the
city
and
say
unto
absalom
i
will
be
thy
servant
o
king
as
i
have
been
thy
father’s
servant
hitherto
so
will
i
now
also
be
thy
servant
then
mayest
thou
for
me
defeat
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
15
35
and
hast
thou
not
there
with
thee
zadok
and
abiathar
the
priests
therefore
it
shall
be
that
what
thing
soever
thou
shalt
hear
out
of
the
king’s
house
thou
shalt
tell
it
to
zadok
and
abiathar
the
priests
15
36
behold
they
have
there
with
them
their
two
sons
ahimaaz
zadok’s
son
and
jonathan
abiathar’s
son
and
by
them
ye
shall
send
unto
me
every
thing
that
ye
can
hear
15
37
so
hushai
david’s
friend
came
into
the
city
and
absalom
came
into
jerusalem
16
1
and
when
david
was
a
little
past
the
top
of
the
hill
behold
ziba
the
servant
of
mephibosheth
met
him
with
a
couple
of
asses
saddled
and
upon
them
two
hundred
loaves
of
bread
and
an
hundred
bunches
of
raisins
and
an
hundred
of
summer
fruits
and
a
bottle
of
wine
16
2
and
the
king
said
unto
ziba
what
meanest
thou
by
these
and
ziba
said
the
asses
be
for
the
king’s
household
to
ride
on
and
the
bread
and
summer
fruit
for
the
young
men
to
eat
and
the
wine
that
such
as
be
faint
in
the
wilderness
may
drink
16
3
and
the
king
said
and
where
is
thy
master’s
son
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
behold
he
abideth
at
jerusalem
for
he
said
to
day
shall
the
house
of
israel
restore
me
the
kingdom
of
my
father
16
4
then
said
the
king
to
ziba
behold
thine
are
all
that
pertained
unto
mephibosheth
and
ziba
said
i
humbly
beseech
thee
that
i
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight
my
lord
o
king
16
5
and
when
king
david
came
to
bahurim
behold
thence
came
out
a
man
of
the
family
of
the
house
of
saul
whose
name
was
shimei
the
son
of
gera
he
came
forth
and
cursed
still
as
he
came
16
6
and
he
cast
stones
at
david
and
at
all
the
servants
of
king
david
and
all
the
people
and
all
the
mighty
men
were
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
16
7
and
thus
said
shimei
when
he
cursed
come
out
come
out
thou
bloody
man
and
thou
man
of
belial
16
8
the
lord
hath
returned
upon
thee
all
the
blood
of
the
house
of
saul
in
whose
stead
thou
hast
reigned
and
the
lord
hath
delivered
the
kingdom
into
the
hand
of
absalom
thy
son
and
behold
thou
art
taken
in
thy
mischief
because
thou
art
a
bloody
man
16
9
then
said
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
unto
the
king
why
should
this
dead
dog
curse
my
lord
the
king
let
me
go
over
i
pray
thee
and
take
off
his
head
16
10
and
the
king
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
ye
sons
of
zeruiah
so
let
him
curse
because
the
lord
hath
said
unto
him
curse
david
who
shall
then
say
wherefore
hast
thou
done
so
16
11
and
david
said
to
abishai
and
to
all
his
servants
behold
my
son
which
came
forth
of
my
bowels
seeketh
my
life
how
much
more
now
may
this
benjamite
do
it
let
him
alone
and
let
him
curse
for
the
lord
hath
bidden
him
16
12
it
may
be
that
the
lord
will
look
on
mine
affliction
and
that
the
lord
will
requite
me
good
for
his
cursing
this
day
16
13
and
as
david
and
his
men
went
by
the
way
shimei
went
along
on
the
hill’s
side
over
against
him
and
cursed
as
he
went
and
threw
stones
at
him
and
cast
dust
16
14
and
the
king
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
came
weary
and
refreshed
themselves
there
16
15
and
absalom
and
all
the
people
the
men
of
israel
came
to
jerusalem
and
ahithophel
with
him
16
16
and
it
came
to
pass
when
hushai
the
archite
david’s
friend
was
come
unto
absalom
that
hushai
said
unto
absalom
god
save
the
king
god
save
the
king
16
17
and
absalom
said
to
hushai
is
this
thy
kindness
to
thy
friend
why
wentest
thou
not
with
thy
friend
16
18
and
hushai
said
unto
absalom
nay
but
whom
the
lord
and
this
people
and
all
the
men
of
israel
choose
his
will
i
be
and
with
him
will
i
abide
16
19
and
again
whom
should
i
serve
should
i
not
serve
in
the
presence
of
his
son
as
i
have
served
in
thy
father’s
presence
so
will
i
be
in
thy
presence
16
20
then
said
absalom
to
ahithophel
give
counsel
among
you
what
we
shall
do
16
21
and
ahithophel
said
unto
absalom
go
in
unto
thy
father’s
concubines
which
he
hath
left
to
keep
the
house
and
all
israel
shall
hear
that
thou
art
abhorred
of
thy
father
then
shall
the
hands
of
all
that
are
with
thee
be
strong
16
22
so
they
spread
absalom
a
tent
upon
the
top
of
the
house
and
absalom
went
in
unto
his
father’s
concubines
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
16
23
and
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
which
he
counselled
in
those
days
was
as
if
a
man
had
enquired
at
the
oracle
of
god
so
was
all
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
both
with
david
and
with
absalom
17
1
moreover
ahithophel
said
unto
absalom
let
me
now
choose
out
twelve
thousand
men
and
i
will
arise
and
pursue
after
david
this
night
17
2
and
i
will
come
upon
him
while
he
is
weary
and
weak
handed
and
will
make
him
afraid
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
shall
flee
and
i
will
smite
the
king
only
17
3
and
i
will
bring
back
all
the
people
unto
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
is
as
if
all
returned
so
all
the
people
shall
be
in
peace
17
4
and
the
saying
pleased
absalom
well
and
all
the
elders
of
israel
17
5
then
said
absalom
call
now
hushai
the
archite
also
and
let
us
hear
likewise
what
he
saith
17
6
and
when
hushai
was
come
to
absalom
absalom
spake
unto
him
saying
ahithophel
hath
spoken
after
this
manner
shall
we
do
after
his
saying
if
not
speak
thou
17
7
and
hushai
said
unto
absalom
the
counsel
that
ahithophel
hath
given
is
not
good
at
this
time
17
8
for
said
hushai
thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
men
that
they
be
mighty
men
and
they
be
chafed
in
their
minds
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
in
the
field
and
thy
father
is
a
man
of
war
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
people
17
9
behold
he
is
hid
now
in
some
pit
or
in
some
other
place
and
it
will
come
to
pass
when
some
of
them
be
overthrown
at
the
first
that
whosoever
heareth
it
will
say
there
is
a
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
absalom
17
10
and
he
also
that
is
valiant
whose
heart
is
as
the
heart
of
a
lion
shall
utterly
melt
for
all
israel
knoweth
that
thy
father
is
a
mighty
man
and
they
which
be
with
him
are
valiant
men
17
11
therefore
i
counsel
that
all
israel
be
generally
gathered
unto
thee
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
as
the
sand
that
is
by
the
sea
for
multitude
and
that
thou
go
to
battle
in
thine
own
person
17
12
so
shall
we
come
upon
him
in
some
place
where
he
shall
be
found
and
we
will
light
upon
him
as
the
dew
falleth
on
the
ground
and
of
him
and
of
all
the
men
that
are
with
him
there
shall
not
be
left
so
much
as
one
17
13
moreover
if
he
be
gotten
into
a
city
then
shall
all
israel
bring
ropes
to
that
city
and
we
will
draw
it
into
the
river
until
there
be
not
one
small
stone
found
there
17
14
and
absalom
and
all
the
men
of
israel
said
the
counsel
of
hushai
the
archite
is
better
than
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
for
the
lord
had
appointed
to
defeat
the
good
counsel
of
ahithophel
to
the
intent
that
the
lord
might
bring
evil
upon
absalom
17
15
then
said
hushai
unto
zadok
and
to
abiathar
the
priests
thus
and
thus
did
ahithophel
counsel
absalom
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
i
counselled
17
16
now
therefore
send
quickly
and
tell
david
saying
lodge
not
this
night
in
the
plains
of
the
wilderness
but
speedily
pass
over
lest
the
king
be
swallowed
up
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
17
17
now
jonathan
and
ahimaaz
stayed
by
enrogel
for
they
might
not
be
seen
to
come
into
the
city
and
a
wench
went
and
told
them
and
they
went
and
told
king
david
17
18
nevertheless
a
lad
saw
them
and
told
absalom
but
they
went
both
of
them
away
quickly
and
came
to
a
man’s
house
in
bahurim
which
had
a
well
in
his
court
whither
they
went
down
17
19
and
the
woman
took
and
spread
a
covering
over
the
well’s
mouth
and
spread
ground
corn
thereon
and
the
thing
was
not
known
17
20
and
when
absalom’s
servants
came
to
the
woman
to
the
house
they
said
where
is
ahimaaz
and
jonathan
and
the
woman
said
unto
them
they
be
gone
over
the
brook
of
water
and
when
they
had
sought
and
could
not
find
them
they
returned
to
jerusalem
17
21
and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
were
departed
that
they
came
up
out
of
the
well
and
went
and
told
king
david
and
said
unto
david
arise
and
pass
quickly
over
the
water
for
thus
hath
ahithophel
counselled
against
you
17
22
then
david
arose
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
they
passed
over
jordan
by
the
morning
light
there
lacked
not
one
of
them
that
was
not
gone
over
jordan
17
23
and
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
counsel
was
not
followed
he
saddled
his
ass
and
arose
and
gat
him
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
and
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father
17
24
then
david
came
to
mahanaim
and
absalom
passed
over
jordan
he
and
all
the
men
of
israel
with
him
17
25
and
absalom
made
amasa
captain
of
the
host
instead
of
joab
which
amasa
was
a
man’s
son
whose
name
was
ithra
an
israelite
that
went
in
to
abigail
the
daughter
of
nahash
sister
to
zeruiah
joab’s
mother
17
26
so
israel
and
absalom
pitched
in
the
land
of
gilead
17
27
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
was
come
to
mahanaim
that
shobi
the
son
of
nahash
of
rabbah
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
of
lodebar
and
barzillai
the
gileadite
of
rogelim
17
28
brought
beds
and
basons
and
earthen
vessels
and
wheat
and
barley
and
flour
and
parched
corn
and
beans
and
lentiles
and
parched
pulse
17
29
and
honey
and
butter
and
sheep
and
cheese
of
kine
for
david
and
for
the
people
that
were
with
him
to
eat
for
they
said
the
people
is
hungry
and
weary
and
thirsty
in
the
wilderness
18
1
and
david
numbered
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
set
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
over
them
18
2
and
david
sent
forth
a
third
part
of
the
people
under
the
hand
of
joab
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
joab’s
brother
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
ittai
the
gittite
and
the
king
said
unto
the
people
i
will
surely
go
forth
with
you
myself
also
18
3
but
the
people
answered
thou
shalt
not
go
forth
for
if
we
flee
away
they
will
not
care
for
us
neither
if
half
of
us
die
will
they
care
for
us
but
now
thou
art
worth
ten
thousand
of
us
therefore
now
it
is
better
that
thou
succour
us
out
of
the
city
18
4
and
the
king
said
unto
them
what
seemeth
you
best
i
will
do
and
the
king
stood
by
the
gate
side
and
all
the
people
came
out
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
18
5
and
the
king
commanded
joab
and
abishai
and
ittai
saying
deal
gently
for
my
sake
with
the
young
man
even
with
absalom
and
all
the
people
heard
when
the
king
gave
all
the
captains
charge
concerning
absalom
18
6
so
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
against
israel
and
the
battle
was
in
the
wood
of
ephraim
18
7
where
the
people
of
israel
were
slain
before
the
servants
of
david
and
there
was
there
a
great
slaughter
that
day
of
twenty
thousand
men
18
8
for
the
battle
was
there
scattered
over
the
face
of
all
the
country
and
the
wood
devoured
more
people
that
day
than
the
sword
devoured
18
9
and
absalom
met
the
servants
of
david
and
absalom
rode
upon
a
mule
and
the
mule
went
under
the
thick
boughs
of
a
great
oak
and
his
head
caught
hold
of
the
oak
and
he
was
taken
up
between
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
mule
that
was
under
him
went
away
18
10
and
a
certain
man
saw
it
and
told
joab
and
said
behold
i
saw
absalom
hanged
in
an
oak
18
11
and
joab
said
unto
the
man
that
told
him
and
behold
thou
sawest
him
and
why
didst
thou
not
smite
him
there
to
the
ground
and
i
would
have
given
thee
ten
shekels
of
silver
and
a
girdle
18
12
and
the
man
said
unto
joab
though
i
should
receive
a
thousand
shekels
of
silver
in
mine
hand
yet
would
i
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
the
king’s
son
for
in
our
hearing
the
king
charged
thee
and
abishai
and
ittai
saying
beware
that
none
touch
the
young
man
absalom
18
13
otherwise
i
should
have
wrought
falsehood
against
mine
own
life
for
there
is
no
matter
hid
from
the
king
and
thou
thyself
wouldest
have
set
thyself
against
me
18
14
then
said
joab
i
may
not
tarry
thus
with
thee
and
he
took
three
darts
in
his
hand
and
thrust
them
through
the
heart
of
absalom
while
he
was
yet
alive
in
the
midst
of
the
oak
18
15
and
ten
young
men
that
bare
joab’s
armour
compassed
about
and
smote
absalom
and
slew
him
18
16
and
joab
blew
the
trumpet
and
the
people
returned
from
pursuing
after
israel
for
joab
held
back
the
people
18
17
and
they
took
absalom
and
cast
him
into
a
great
pit
in
the
wood
and
laid
a
very
great
heap
of
stones
upon
him
and
all
israel
fled
every
one
to
his
tent
18
18
now
absalom
in
his
lifetime
had
taken
and
reared
up
for
himself
a
pillar
which
is
in
the
king’s
dale
for
he
said
i
have
no
son
to
keep
my
name
in
remembrance
and
he
called
the
pillar
after
his
own
name
and
it
is
called
unto
this
day
absalom’s
place
18
19
then
said
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
let
me
now
run
and
bear
the
king
tidings
how
that
the
lord
hath
avenged
him
of
his
enemies
18
20
and
joab
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
bear
tidings
this
day
but
thou
shalt
bear
tidings
another
day
but
this
day
thou
shalt
bear
no
tidings
because
the
king’s
son
is
dead
18
21
then
said
joab
to
cushi
go
tell
the
king
what
thou
hast
seen
and
cushi
bowed
himself
unto
joab
and
ran
18
22
then
said
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
yet
again
to
joab
but
howsoever
let
me
i
pray
thee
also
run
after
cushi
and
joab
said
wherefore
wilt
thou
run
my
son
seeing
that
thou
hast
no
tidings
ready
18
23
but
howsoever
said
he
let
me
run
and
he
said
unto
him
run
then
ahimaaz
ran
by
the
way
of
the
plain
and
overran
cushi
18
24
and
david
sat
between
the
two
gates
and
the
watchman
went
up
to
the
roof
over
the
gate
unto
the
wall
and
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
man
running
alone
18
25
and
the
watchman
cried
and
told
the
king
and
the
king
said
if
he
be
alone
there
is
tidings
in
his
mouth
and
he
came
apace
and
drew
near
18
26
and
the
watchman
saw
another
man
running
and
the
watchman
called
unto
the
porter
and
said
behold
another
man
running
alone
and
the
king
said
he
also
bringeth
tidings
18
27
and
the
watchman
said
me
thinketh
the
running
of
the
foremost
is
like
the
running
of
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
and
the
king
said
he
is
a
good
man
and
cometh
with
good
tidings
18
28
and
ahimaaz
called
and
said
unto
the
king
all
is
well
and
he
fell
down
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
king
and
said
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
hath
delivered
up
the
men
that
lifted
up
their
hand
against
my
lord
the
king
18
29
and
the
king
said
is
the
young
man
absalom
safe
and
ahimaaz
answered
when
joab
sent
the
king’s
servant
and
me
thy
servant
i
saw
a
great
tumult
but
i
knew
not
what
it
was
18
30
and
the
king
said
unto
him
turn
aside
and
stand
here
and
he
turned
aside
and
stood
still
18
31
and
behold
cushi
came
and
cushi
said
tidings
my
lord
the
king
for
the
lord
hath
avenged
thee
this
day
of
all
them
that
rose
up
against
thee
18
32
and
the
king
said
unto
cushi
is
the
young
man
absalom
safe
and
cushi
answered
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
and
all
that
rise
against
thee
to
do
thee
hurt
be
as
that
young
man
is
18
33
and
the
king
was
much
moved
and
went
up
to
the
chamber
over
the
gate
and
wept
and
as
he
went
thus
he
said
o
my
son
absalom
my
son
my
son
absalom
would
god
i
had
died
for
thee
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
19
1
and
it
was
told
joab
behold
the
king
weepeth
and
mourneth
for
absalom
19
2
and
the
victory
that
day
was
turned
into
mourning
unto
all
the
people
for
the
people
heard
say
that
day
how
the
king
was
grieved
for
his
son
19
3
and
the
people
gat
them
by
stealth
that
day
into
the
city
as
people
being
ashamed
steal
away
when
they
flee
in
battle
19
4
but
the
king
covered
his
face
and
the
king
cried
with
a
loud
voice
o
my
son
absalom
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
19
5
and
joab
came
into
the
house
to
the
king
and
said
thou
hast
shamed
this
day
the
faces
of
all
thy
servants
which
this
day
have
saved
thy
life
and
the
lives
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters
and
the
lives
of
thy
wives
and
the
lives
of
thy
concubines
19
6
in
that
thou
lovest
thine
enemies
and
hatest
thy
friends
for
thou
hast
declared
this
day
that
thou
regardest
neither
princes
nor
servants
for
this
day
i
perceive
that
if
absalom
had
lived
and
all
we
had
died
this
day
then
it
had
pleased
thee
well
19
7
now
therefore
arise
go
forth
and
speak
comfortably
unto
thy
servants
for
i
swear
by
the
lord
if
thou
go
not
forth
there
will
not
tarry
one
with
thee
this
night
and
that
will
be
worse
unto
thee
than
all
the
evil
that
befell
thee
from
thy
youth
until
now
19
8
then
the
king
arose
and
sat
in
the
gate
and
they
told
unto
all
the
people
saying
behold
the
king
doth
sit
in
the
gate
and
all
the
people
came
before
the
king
for
israel
had
fled
every
man
to
his
tent
19
9
and
all
the
people
were
at
strife
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
saying
the
king
saved
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
and
he
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
now
he
is
fled
out
of
the
land
for
absalom
19
10
and
absalom
whom
we
anointed
over
us
is
dead
in
battle
now
therefore
why
speak
ye
not
a
word
of
bringing
the
king
back
19
11
and
king
david
sent
to
zadok
and
to
abiathar
the
priests
saying
speak
unto
the
elders
of
judah
saying
why
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
the
king
back
to
his
house
seeing
the
speech
of
all
israel
is
come
to
the
king
even
to
his
house
19
12
ye
are
my
brethren
ye
are
my
bones
and
my
flesh
wherefore
then
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
back
the
king
19
13
and
say
ye
to
amasa
art
thou
not
of
my
bone
and
of
my
flesh
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
thou
be
not
captain
of
the
host
before
me
continually
in
the
room
of
joab
19
14
and
he
bowed
the
heart
of
all
the
men
of
judah
even
as
the
heart
of
one
man
so
that
they
sent
this
word
unto
the
king
return
thou
and
all
thy
servants
19
15
so
the
king
returned
and
came
to
jordan
and
judah
came
to
gilgal
to
go
to
meet
the
king
to
conduct
the
king
over
jordan
19
16
and
shimei
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
which
was
of
bahurim
hasted
and
came
down
with
the
men
of
judah
to
meet
king
david
19
17
and
there
were
a
thousand
men
of
benjamin
with
him
and
ziba
the
servant
of
the
house
of
saul
and
his
fifteen
sons
and
his
twenty
servants
with
him
and
they
went
over
jordan
before
the
king
19
18
and
there
went
over
a
ferry
boat
to
carry
over
the
king’s
household
and
to
do
what
he
thought
good
and
shimei
the
son
of
gera
fell
down
before
the
king
as
he
was
come
over
jordan
19
19
and
said
unto
the
king
let
not
my
lord
impute
iniquity
unto
me
neither
do
thou
remember
that
which
thy
servant
did
perversely
the
day
that
my
lord
the
king
went
out
of
jerusalem
that
the
king
should
take
it
to
his
heart
19
20
for
thy
servant
doth
know
that
i
have
sinned
therefore
behold
i
am
come
the
first
this
day
of
all
the
house
of
joseph
to
go
down
to
meet
my
lord
the
king
19
21
but
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
answered
and
said
shall
not
shimei
be
put
to
death
for
this
because
he
cursed
the
lord’s
anointed
19
22
and
david
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
ye
sons
of
zeruiah
that
ye
should
this
day
be
adversaries
unto
me
shall
there
any
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
in
israel
for
do
not
i
know
that
i
am
this
day
king
over
israel
19
23
therefore
the
king
said
unto
shimei
thou
shalt
not
die
and
the
king
sware
unto
him
19
24
and
mephibosheth
the
son
of
saul
came
down
to
meet
the
king
and
had
neither
dressed
his
feet
nor
trimmed
his
beard
nor
washed
his
clothes
from
the
day
the
king
departed
until
the
day
he
came
again
in
peace
19
25
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
to
jerusalem
to
meet
the
king
that
the
king
said
unto
him
wherefore
wentest
not
thou
with
me
mephibosheth
19
26
and
he
answered
my
lord
o
king
my
servant
deceived
me
for
thy
servant
said
i
will
saddle
me
an
ass
that
i
may
ride
thereon
and
go
to
the
king
because
thy
servant
is
lame
19
27
and
he
hath
slandered
thy
servant
unto
my
lord
the
king
but
my
lord
the
king
is
as
an
angel
of
god
do
therefore
what
is
good
in
thine
eyes
19
28
for
all
of
my
father’s
house
were
but
dead
men
before
my
lord
the
king
yet
didst
thou
set
thy
servant
among
them
that
did
eat
at
thine
own
table
what
right
therefore
have
i
yet
to
cry
any
more
unto
the
king
19
29
and
the
king
said
unto
him
why
speakest
thou
any
more
of
thy
matters
i
have
said
thou
and
ziba
divide
the
land
19
30
and
mephibosheth
said
unto
the
king
yea
let
him
take
all
forasmuch
as
my
lord
the
king
is
come
again
in
peace
unto
his
own
house
19
31
and
barzillai
the
gileadite
came
down
from
rogelim
and
went
over
jordan
with
the
king
to
conduct
him
over
jordan
19
32
now
barzillai
was
a
very
aged
man
even
fourscore
years
old
and
he
had
provided
the
king
of
sustenance
while
he
lay
at
mahanaim
for
he
was
a
very
great
man
19
33
and
the
king
said
unto
barzillai
come
thou
over
with
me
and
i
will
feed
thee
with
me
in
jerusalem
19
34
and
barzillai
said
unto
the
king
how
long
have
i
to
live
that
i
should
go
up
with
the
king
unto
jerusalem
19
35
i
am
this
day
fourscore
years
old
and
can
i
discern
between
good
and
evil
can
thy
servant
taste
what
i
eat
or
what
i
drink
can
i
hear
any
more
the
voice
of
singing
men
and
singing
women
wherefore
then
should
thy
servant
be
yet
a
burden
unto
my
lord
the
king
19
36
thy
servant
will
go
a
little
way
over
jordan
with
the
king
and
why
should
the
king
recompense
it
me
with
such
a
reward
19
37
let
thy
servant
i
pray
thee
turn
back
again
that
i
may
die
in
mine
own
city
and
be
buried
by
the
grave
of
my
father
and
of
my
mother
but
behold
thy
servant
chimham
let
him
go
over
with
my
lord
the
king
and
do
to
him
what
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
19
38
and
the
king
answered
chimham
shall
go
over
with
me
and
i
will
do
to
him
that
which
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
require
of
me
that
will
i
do
for
thee
19
39
and
all
the
people
went
over
jordan
and
when
the
king
was
come
over
the
king
kissed
barzillai
and
blessed
him
and
he
returned
unto
his
own
place
19
40
then
the
king
went
on
to
gilgal
and
chimham
went
on
with
him
and
all
the
people
of
judah
conducted
the
king
and
also
half
the
people
of
israel
19
41
and
behold
all
the
men
of
israel
came
to
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
why
have
our
brethren
the
men
of
judah
stolen
thee
away
and
have
brought
the
king
and
his
household
and
all
david’s
men
with
him
over
jordan
19
42
and
all
the
men
of
judah
answered
the
men
of
israel
because
the
king
is
near
of
kin
to
us
wherefore
then
be
ye
angry
for
this
matter
have
we
eaten
at
all
of
the
king’s
cost
or
hath
he
given
us
any
gift
19
43
and
the
men
of
israel
answered
the
men
of
judah
and
said
we
have
ten
parts
in
the
king
and
we
have
also
more
right
in
david
than
ye
why
then
did
ye
despise
us
that
our
advice
should
not
be
first
had
in
bringing
back
our
king
and
the
words
of
the
men
of
judah
were
fiercer
than
the
words
of
the
men
of
israel
20
1
and
there
happened
to
be
there
a
man
of
belial
whose
name
was
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
a
benjamite
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
said
we
have
no
part
in
david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
every
man
to
his
tents
o
israel
20
2
so
every
man
of
israel
went
up
from
after
david
and
followed
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
but
the
men
of
judah
clave
unto
their
king
from
jordan
even
to
jerusalem
20
3
and
david
came
to
his
house
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
took
the
ten
women
his
concubines
whom
he
had
left
to
keep
the
house
and
put
them
in
ward
and
fed
them
but
went
not
in
unto
them
so
they
were
shut
up
unto
the
day
of
their
death
living
in
widowhood
20
4
then
said
the
king
to
amasa
assemble
me
the
men
of
judah
within
three
days
and
be
thou
here
present
20
5
so
amasa
went
to
assemble
the
men
of
judah
but
he
tarried
longer
than
the
set
time
which
he
had
appointed
him
20
6
and
david
said
to
abishai
now
shall
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
do
us
more
harm
than
did
absalom
take
thou
thy
lord’s
servants
and
pursue
after
him
lest
he
get
him
fenced
cities
and
escape
us
20
7
and
there
went
out
after
him
joab’s
men
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
all
the
mighty
men
and
they
went
out
of
jerusalem
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
20
8
when
they
were
at
the
great
stone
which
is
in
gibeon
amasa
went
before
them
and
joab’s
garment
that
he
had
put
on
was
girded
unto
him
and
upon
it
a
girdle
with
a
sword
fastened
upon
his
loins
in
the
sheath
thereof
and
as
he
went
forth
it
fell
out
20
9
and
joab
said
to
amasa
art
thou
in
health
my
brother
and
joab
took
amasa
by
the
beard
with
the
right
hand
to
kiss
him
20
10
but
amasa
took
no
heed
to
the
sword
that
was
in
joab’s
hand
so
he
smote
him
therewith
in
the
fifth
rib
and
shed
out
his
bowels
to
the
ground
and
struck
him
not
again
and
he
died
so
joab
and
abishai
his
brother
pursued
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
20
11
and
one
of
joab’s
men
stood
by
him
and
said
he
that
favoureth
joab
and
he
that
is
for
david
let
him
go
after
joab
20
12
and
amasa
wallowed
in
blood
in
the
midst
of
the
highway
and
when
the
man
saw
that
all
the
people
stood
still
he
removed
amasa
out
of
the
highway
into
the
field
and
cast
a
cloth
upon
him
when
he
saw
that
every
one
that
came
by
him
stood
still
20
13
when
he
was
removed
out
of
the
highway
all
the
people
went
on
after
joab
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
20
14
and
he
went
through
all
the
tribes
of
israel
unto
abel
and
to
bethmaachah
and
all
the
berites
and
they
were
gathered
together
and
went
also
after
him
20
15
and
they
came
and
besieged
him
in
abel
of
bethmaachah
and
they
cast
up
a
bank
against
the
city
and
it
stood
in
the
trench
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
joab
battered
the
wall
to
throw
it
down
20
16
then
cried
a
wise
woman
out
of
the
city
hear
hear
say
i
pray
you
unto
joab
come
near
hither
that
i
may
speak
with
thee
20
17
and
when
he
was
come
near
unto
her
the
woman
said
art
thou
joab
and
he
answered
i
am
he
then
she
said
unto
him
hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid
and
he
answered
i
do
hear
20
18
then
she
spake
saying
they
were
wont
to
speak
in
old
time
saying
they
shall
surely
ask
counsel
at
abel
and
so
they
ended
the
matter
20
19
i
am
one
of
them
that
are
peaceable
and
faithful
in
israel
thou
seekest
to
destroy
a
city
and
a
mother
in
israel
why
wilt
thou
swallow
up
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
20
20
and
joab
answered
and
said
far
be
it
far
be
it
from
me
that
i
should
swallow
up
or
destroy
20
21
the
matter
is
not
so
but
a
man
of
mount
ephraim
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
by
name
hath
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
even
against
david
deliver
him
only
and
i
will
depart
from
the
city
and
the
woman
said
unto
joab
behold
his
head
shall
be
thrown
to
thee
over
the
wall
20
22
then
the
woman
went
unto
all
the
people
in
her
wisdom
and
they
cut
off
the
head
of
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
and
cast
it
out
to
joab
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
they
retired
from
the
city
every
man
to
his
tent
and
joab
returned
to
jerusalem
unto
the
king
20
23
now
joab
was
over
all
the
host
of
israel
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
was
over
the
cherethites
and
over
the
pelethites
20
24
and
adoram
was
over
the
tribute
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
was
recorder
20
25
and
sheva
was
scribe
and
zadok
and
abiathar
were
the
priests
20
26
and
ira
also
the
jairite
was
a
chief
ruler
about
david
21
1
then
there
was
a
famine
in
the
days
of
david
three
years
year
after
year
and
david
enquired
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
answered
it
is
for
saul
and
for
his
bloody
house
because
he
slew
the
gibeonites
21
2
and
the
king
called
the
gibeonites
and
said
unto
them
(now
the
gibeonites
were
not
of
the
children
of
israel
but
of
the
remnant
of
the
amorites
and
the
children
of
israel
had
sworn
unto
them
and
saul
sought
to
slay
them
in
his
zeal
to
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
)
21
3
wherefore
david
said
unto
the
gibeonites
what
shall
i
do
for
you
and
wherewith
shall
i
make
the
atonement
that
ye
may
bless
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
21
4
and
the
gibeonites
said
unto
him
we
will
have
no
silver
nor
gold
of
saul
nor
of
his
house
neither
for
us
shalt
thou
kill
any
man
in
israel
and
he
said
what
ye
shall
say
that
will
i
do
for
you
21
5
and
they
answered
the
king
the
man
that
consumed
us
and
that
devised
against
us
that
we
should
be
destroyed
from
remaining
in
any
of
the
coasts
of
israel
21
6
let
seven
men
of
his
sons
be
delivered
unto
us
and
we
will
hang
them
up
unto
the
lord
in
gibeah
of
saul
whom
the
lord
did
choose
and
the
king
said
i
will
give
them
21
7
but
the
king
spared
mephibosheth
the
son
of
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
because
of
the
lord’s
oath
that
was
between
them
between
david
and
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
21
8
but
the
king
took
the
two
sons
of
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
whom
she
bare
unto
saul
armoni
and
mephibosheth
and
the
five
sons
of
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
whom
she
brought
up
for
adriel
the
son
of
barzillai
the
meholathite
21
9
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
gibeonites
and
they
hanged
them
in
the
hill
before
the
lord
and
they
fell
all
seven
together
and
were
put
to
death
in
the
days
of
harvest
in
the
first
days
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest
21
10
and
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
took
sackcloth
and
spread
it
for
her
upon
the
rock
from
the
beginning
of
harvest
until
water
dropped
upon
them
out
of
heaven
and
suffered
neither
the
birds
of
the
air
to
rest
on
them
by
day
nor
the
beasts
of
the
field
by
night
21
11
and
it
was
told
david
what
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
the
concubine
of
saul
had
done
21
12
and
david
went
and
took
the
bones
of
saul
and
the
bones
of
jonathan
his
son
from
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
which
had
stolen
them
from
the
street
of
bethshan
where
the
philistines
had
hanged
them
when
the
philistines
had
slain
saul
in
gilboa
21
13
and
he
brought
up
from
thence
the
bones
of
saul
and
the
bones
of
jonathan
his
son
and
they
gathered
the
bones
of
them
that
were
hanged
21
14
and
the
bones
of
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
buried
they
in
the
country
of
benjamin
in
zelah
in
the
sepulchre
of
kish
his
father
and
they
performed
all
that
the
king
commanded
and
after
that
god
was
intreated
for
the
land
21
15
moreover
the
philistines
had
yet
war
again
with
israel
and
david
went
down
and
his
servants
with
him
and
fought
against
the
philistines
and
david
waxed
faint
21
16
and
ishbibenob
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant
the
weight
of
whose
spear
weighed
three
hundred
shekels
of
brass
in
weight
he
being
girded
with
a
new
sword
thought
to
have
slain
david
21
17
but
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
succoured
him
and
smote
the
philistine
and
killed
him
then
the
men
of
david
sware
unto
him
saying
thou
shalt
go
no
more
out
with
us
to
battle
that
thou
quench
not
the
light
of
israel
21
18
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
there
was
again
a
battle
with
the
philistines
at
gob
then
sibbechai
the
hushathite
slew
saph
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant
21
19
and
there
was
again
a
battle
in
gob
with
the
philistines
where
elhanan
the
son
of
jaareoregim
a
bethlehemite
slew
the
brother
of
goliath
the
gittite
the
staff
of
whose
spear
was
like
a
weaver’s
beam
21
20
and
there
was
yet
a
battle
in
gath
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature
that
had
on
every
hand
six
fingers
and
on
every
foot
six
toes
four
and
twenty
in
number
and
he
also
was
born
to
the
giant
21
21
and
when
he
defied
israel
jonathan
the
son
of
shimeah
the
brother
of
david
slew
him
21
22
these
four
were
born
to
the
giant
in
gath
and
fell
by
the
hand
of
david
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
22
1
and
david
spake
unto
the
lord
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
day
that
the
lord
had
delivered
him
out
of
the
hand
of
all
his
enemies
and
out
of
the
hand
of
saul
22
2
and
he
said
the
lord
is
my
rock
and
my
fortress
and
my
deliverer
22
3
the
god
of
my
rock
in
him
will
i
trust
he
is
my
shield
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation
my
high
tower
and
my
refuge
my
saviour
thou
savest
me
from
violence
22
4
i
will
call
on
the
lord
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised
so
shall
i
be
saved
from
mine
enemies
22
5
when
the
waves
of
death
compassed
me
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid
22
6
the
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me
22
7
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
and
cried
to
my
god
and
he
did
hear
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
did
enter
into
his
ears
22
8
then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
the
foundations
of
heaven
moved
and
shook
because
he
was
wroth
22
9
there
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured
coals
were
kindled
by
it
22
10
he
bowed
the
heavens
also
and
came
down
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet
22
11
and
he
rode
upon
a
cherub
and
did
fly
and
he
was
seen
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
22
12
and
he
made
darkness
pavilions
round
about
him
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
22
13
through
the
brightness
before
him
were
coals
of
fire
kindled
22
14
the
lord
thundered
from
heaven
and
the
most
high
uttered
his
voice
22
15
and
he
sent
out
arrows
and
scattered
them
lightning
and
discomfited
them
22
16
and
the
channels
of
the
sea
appeared
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered
at
the
rebuking
of
the
lord
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
22
17
he
sent
from
above
he
took
me
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters
22
18
he
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy
and
from
them
that
hated
me
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me
22
19
they
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity
but
the
lord
was
my
stay
22
20
he
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place
he
delivered
me
because
he
delighted
in
me
22
21
the
lord
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me
22
22
for
i
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
god
22
23
for
all
his
judgments
were
before
me
and
as
for
his
statutes
i
did
not
depart
from
them
22
24
i
was
also
upright
before
him
and
have
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity
22
25
therefore
the
lord
hath
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
my
cleanness
in
his
eye
sight
22
26
with
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful
and
with
the
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright
22
27
with
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
unsavoury
22
28
and
the
afflicted
people
thou
wilt
save
but
thine
eyes
are
upon
the
haughty
that
thou
mayest
bring
them
down
22
29
for
thou
art
my
lamp
o
lord
and
the
lord
will
lighten
my
darkness
22
30
for
by
thee
i
have
run
through
a
troop
by
my
god
have
i
leaped
over
a
wall
22
31
as
for
god
his
way
is
perfect
the
word
of
the
lord
is
tried
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
them
that
trust
in
him
22
32
for
who
is
god
save
the
lord
and
who
is
a
rock
save
our
god
22
33
god
is
my
strength
and
power
and
he
maketh
my
way
perfect
22
34
he
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds’
feet
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places
22
35
he
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms
22
36
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great
22
37
thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me
so
that
my
feet
did
not
slip
22
38
i
have
pursued
mine
enemies
and
destroyed
them
and
turned
not
again
until
i
had
consumed
them
22
39
and
i
have
consumed
them
and
wounded
them
that
they
could
not
arise
yea
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet
22
40
for
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
to
battle
them
that
rose
up
against
me
hast
thou
subdued
under
me
22
41
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies
that
i
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me
22
42
they
looked
but
there
was
none
to
save
even
unto
the
lord
but
he
answered
them
not
22
43
then
did
i
beat
them
as
small
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
i
did
stamp
them
as
the
mire
of
the
street
and
did
spread
them
abroad
22
44
thou
also
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
my
people
thou
hast
kept
me
to
be
head
of
the
heathen
a
people
which
i
knew
not
shall
serve
me
22
45
strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me
as
soon
as
they
hear
they
shall
be
obedient
unto
me
22
46
strangers
shall
fade
away
and
they
shall
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places
22
47
the
lord
liveth
and
blessed
be
my
rock
and
exalted
be
the
god
of
the
rock
of
my
salvation
22
48
it
is
god
that
avengeth
me
and
that
bringeth
down
the
people
under
me
22
49
and
that
bringeth
me
forth
from
mine
enemies
thou
also
hast
lifted
me
up
on
high
above
them
that
rose
up
against
me
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man
22
50
therefore
i
will
give
thanks
unto
thee
o
lord
among
the
heathen
and
i
will
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
22
51
he
is
the
tower
of
salvation
for
his
king
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed
unto
david
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore
23
1
now
these
be
the
last
words
of
david
david
the
son
of
jesse
said
and
the
man
who
was
raised
up
on
high
the
anointed
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
the
sweet
psalmist
of
israel
said
23
2
the
spirit
of
the
lord
spake
by
me
and
his
word
was
in
my
tongue
23
3
the
god
of
israel
said
the
rock
of
israel
spake
to
me
he
that
ruleth
over
men
must
be
just
ruling
in
the
fear
of
god
23
4
and
he
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning
when
the
sun
riseth
even
a
morning
without
clouds
as
the
tender
grass
springing
out
of
the
earth
by
clear
shining
after
rain
23
5
although
my
house
be
not
so
with
god
yet
he
hath
made
with
me
an
everlasting
covenant
ordered
in
all
things
and
sure
for
this
is
all
my
salvation
and
all
my
desire
although
he
make
it
not
to
grow
23
6
but
the
sons
of
belial
shall
be
all
of
them
as
thorns
thrust
away
because
they
cannot
be
taken
with
hands
23
7
but
the
man
that
shall
touch
them
must
be
fenced
with
iron
and
the
staff
of
a
spear
and
they
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
in
the
same
place
23
8
these
be
the
names
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
the
tachmonite
that
sat
in
the
seat
chief
among
the
captains
the
same
was
adino
the
eznite
he
lift
up
his
spear
against
eight
hundred
whom
he
slew
at
one
time
23
9
and
after
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
dodo
the
ahohite
one
of
the
three
mighty
men
with
david
when
they
defied
the
philistines
that
were
there
gathered
together
to
battle
and
the
men
of
israel
were
gone
away
23
10
he
arose
and
smote
the
philistines
until
his
hand
was
weary
and
his
hand
clave
unto
the
sword
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
victory
that
day
and
the
people
returned
after
him
only
to
spoil
23
11
and
after
him
was
shammah
the
son
of
agee
the
hararite
and
the
philistines
were
gathered
together
into
a
troop
where
was
a
piece
of
ground
full
of
lentiles
and
the
people
fled
from
the
philistines
23
12
but
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
ground
and
defended
it
and
slew
the
philistines
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
victory
23
13
and
three
of
the
thirty
chief
went
down
and
came
to
david
in
the
harvest
time
unto
the
cave
of
adullam
and
the
troop
of
the
philistines
pitched
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
23
14
and
david
was
then
in
an
hold
and
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
was
then
in
bethlehem
23
15
and
david
longed
and
said
oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
which
is
by
the
gate
23
16
and
the
three
mighty
men
brake
through
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
was
by
the
gate
and
took
it
and
brought
it
to
david
nevertheless
he
would
not
drink
thereof
but
poured
it
out
unto
the
lord
23
17
and
he
said
be
it
far
from
me
o
lord
that
i
should
do
this
is
not
this
the
blood
of
the
men
that
went
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives
therefore
he
would
not
drink
it
these
things
did
these
three
mighty
men
23
18
and
abishai
the
brother
of
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
chief
among
three
and
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
and
slew
them
and
had
the
name
among
three
23
19
was
he
not
most
honourable
of
three
therefore
he
was
their
captain
howbeit
he
attained
not
unto
the
first
three
23
20
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
son
of
a
valiant
man
of
kabzeel
who
had
done
many
acts
he
slew
two
lionlike
men
of
moab
he
went
down
also
and
slew
a
lion
in
the
midst
of
a
pit
in
time
of
snow
23
21
and
he
slew
an
egyptian
a
goodly
man
and
the
egyptian
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
but
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
egyptian’s
hand
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear
23
22
these
things
did
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
had
the
name
among
three
mighty
men
23
23
he
was
more
honourable
than
the
thirty
but
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three
and
david
set
him
over
his
guard
23
24

uriah
the

thirty
and

in

24
1
and
again
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
moved
david
against
them
to
say
go
number
israel
and
judah
24
2
for
the
king
said
to
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
which
was
with
him
go
now
through
all
the
tribes
of
israel
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
and
number
ye
the
people
that
i
may
know
the
number
of
the
people
24
3
and
joab
said
unto
the
king
now
the
lord
thy
god
add
unto
the
people
how
many
soever
they
be
an
hundredfold
and
that
the
eyes
of
my
lord
the
king
may
see
it
but
why
doth
my
lord
the
king
delight
in
this
thing
24
4
notwithstanding
the
king’s
word
prevailed
against
joab
and
against
the
captains
of
the
host
and
joab
and
the
captains
of
the
host
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king
to
number
the
people
of
israel
24
5
and
they
passed
over
jordan
and
pitched
in
aroer
on
the
right
side
of
the
city
that
lieth
in
the
midst
of
the
river
of
gad
and
toward
jazer
24
6
then
they
came
to
gilead
and
to
the
land
of
tahtimhodshi
and
they
came
to
danjaan
and
about
to
zidon
24
7
and
came
to
the
strong
hold
of
tyre
and
to
all
the
cities
of
the
hivites
and
of
the
canaanites
and
they
went
out
to
the
south
of
judah
even
to
beersheba
24
8
so
when
they
had
gone
through
all
the
land
they
came
to
jerusalem
at
the
end
of
nine
months
and
twenty
days
24
9
and
joab
gave
up
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
the
king
and
there
were
in
israel
eight
hundred
thousand
valiant
men
that
drew
the
sword
and
the
men
of
judah
were
five
hundred
thousand
men
24
10
and
david’s
heart
smote
him
after
that
he
had
numbered
the
people
and
david
said
unto
the
lord
i
have
sinned
greatly
in
that
i
have
done
and
now
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
take
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant
for
i
have
done
very
foolishly
24
11
for
when
david
was
up
in
the
morning
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
the
prophet
gad
david’s
seer
saying
24
12
go
and
say
unto
david
thus
saith
the
lord
i
offer
thee
three
things
choose
thee
one
of
them
that
i
may
do
it
unto
thee
24
13
so
gad
came
to
david
and
told
him
and
said
unto
him
shall
seven
years
of
famine
come
unto
thee
in
thy
land
or
wilt
thou
flee
three
months
before
thine
enemies
while
they
pursue
thee
or
that
there
be
three
days’
pestilence
in
thy
land
now
advise
and
see
what
answer
i
shall
return
to
him
that
sent
me
24
14
and
david
said
unto
gad
i
am
in
a
great
strait
let
us
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
lord
for
his
mercies
are
great
and
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
24
15
so
the
lord
sent
a
pestilence
upon
israel
from
the
morning
even
to
the
time
appointed
and
there
died
of
the
people
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
seventy
thousand
men
24
16
and
when
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
upon
jerusalem
to
destroy
it
the
lord
repented
him
of
the
evil
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed
the
people
it
is
enough
stay
now
thine
hand
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
was
by
the
threshingplace
of
araunah
the
jebusite
24
17
and
david
spake
unto
the
lord
when
he
saw
the
angel
that
smote
the
people
and
said
lo
i
have
sinned
and
i
have
done
wickedly
but
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thine
hand
i
pray
thee
be
against
me
and
against
my
father’s
house
24
18
and
gad
came
that
day
to
david
and
said
unto
him
go
up
rear
an
altar
unto
the
lord
in
the
threshingfloor
of
araunah
the
jebusite
24
19
and
david
according
to
the
saying
of
gad
went
up
as
the
lord
commanded
24
20
and
araunah
looked
and
saw
the
king
and
his
servants
coming
on
toward
him
and
araunah
went
out
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
on
his
face
upon
the
ground
24
21
and
araunah
said
wherefore
is
my
lord
the
king
come
to
his
servant
and
david
said
to
buy
the
threshingfloor
of
thee
to
build
an
altar
unto
the
lord
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people
24
22
and
araunah
said
unto
david
let
my
lord
the
king
take
and
offer
up
what
seemeth
good
unto
him
behold
here
be
oxen
for
burnt
sacrifice
and
threshing
instruments
and
other
instruments
of
the
oxen
for
wood
24
23
all
these
things
did
araunah
as
a
king
give
unto
the
king
and
araunah
said
unto
the
king
the
lord
thy
god
accept
thee
24
24
and
the
king
said
unto
araunah
nay
but
i
will
surely
buy
it
of
thee
at
a
price
neither
will
i
offer
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
my
god
of
that
which
doth
cost
me
nothing
so
david
bought
the
threshingfloor
and
the
oxen
for
fifty
shekels
of
silver
24
25
and
david
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
so
the
lord
was
intreated
for
the
land
and
the
plague
was
stayed
from
israel
the
first
book
of
the
kings
commonly
called
the
third
book
of
the
kings
1
1
now
king
david
was
old
and
stricken
in
years
and
they
covered
him
with
clothes
but
he
gat
no
heat
1
2
wherefore
his
servants
said
unto
him
let
there
be
sought
for
my
lord
the
king
a
young
virgin
and
let
her
stand
before
the
king
and
let
her
cherish
him
and
let
her
lie
in
thy
bosom
that
my
lord
the
king
may
get
heat
1
3
so
they
sought
for
a
fair
damsel
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
and
found
abishag
a
shunammite
and
brought
her
to
the
king
1
4
and
the
damsel
was
very
fair
and
cherished
the
king
and
ministered
to
him
but
the
king
knew
her
not
1
5
then
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
exalted
himself
saying
i
will
be
king
and
he
prepared
him
chariots
and
horsemen
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him
1
6
and
his
father
had
not
displeased
him
at
any
time
in
saying
why
hast
thou
done
so
and
he
also
was
a
very
goodly
man
and
his
mother
bare
him
after
absalom
1
7
and
he
conferred
with
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
and
with
abiathar
the
priest
and
they
following
adonijah
helped
him
1
8
but
zadok
the
priest
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
shimei
and
rei
and
the
mighty
men
which
belonged
to
david
were
not
with
adonijah
1
9
and
adonijah
slew
sheep
and
oxen
and
fat
cattle
by
the
stone
of
zoheleth
which
is
by
enrogel
and
called
all
his
brethren
the
king’s
sons
and
all
the
men
of
judah
the
king’s
servants
1
10
but
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
and
the
mighty
men
and
solomon
his
brother
he
called
not
1
11
wherefore
nathan
spake
unto
bathsheba
the
mother
of
solomon
saying
hast
thou
not
heard
that
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
doth
reign
and
david
our
lord
knoweth
it
not
1
12
now
therefore
come
let
me
i
pray
thee
give
thee
counsel
that
thou
mayest
save
thine
own
life
and
the
life
of
thy
son
solomon
1
13
go
and
get
thee
in
unto
king
david
and
say
unto
him
didst
not
thou
my
lord
o
king
swear
unto
thine
handmaid
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
why
then
doth
adonijah
reign
1
14
behold
while
thou
yet
talkest
there
with
the
king
i
also
will
come
in
after
thee
and
confirm
thy
words
1
15
and
bathsheba
went
in
unto
the
king
into
the
chamber
and
the
king
was
very
old
and
abishag
the
shunammite
ministered
unto
the
king
1
16
and
bathsheba
bowed
and
did
obeisance
unto
the
king
and
the
king
said
what
wouldest
thou
1
17
and
she
said
unto
him
my
lord
thou
swarest
by
the
lord
thy
god
unto
thine
handmaid
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
1
18
and
now
behold
adonijah
reigneth
and
now
my
lord
the
king
thou
knowest
it
not
1
19
and
he
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
sons
of
the
king
and
abiathar
the
priest
and
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
but
solomon
thy
servant
hath
he
not
called
1
20
and
thou
my
lord
o
king
the
eyes
of
all
israel
are
upon
thee
that
thou
shouldest
tell
them
who
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
1
21
otherwise
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
my
lord
the
king
shall
sleep
with
his
fathers
that
i
and
my
son
solomon
shall
be
counted
offenders
1
22
and
lo
while
she
yet
talked
with
the
king
nathan
the
prophet
also
came
in
1
23
and
they
told
the
king
saying
behold
nathan
the
prophet
and
when
he
was
come
in
before
the
king
he
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground
1
24
and
nathan
said
my
lord
o
king
hast
thou
said
adonijah
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
1
25
for
he
is
gone
down
this
day
and
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
king’s
sons
and
the
captains
of
the
host
and
abiathar
the
priest
and
behold
they
eat
and
drink
before
him
and
say
god
save
king
adonijah
1
26
but
me
even
me
thy
servant
and
zadok
the
priest
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
thy
servant
solomon
hath
he
not
called
1
27
is
this
thing
done
by
my
lord
the
king
and
thou
hast
not
shewed
it
unto
thy
servant
who
should
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
1
28
then
king
david
answered
and
said
call
me
bathsheba
and
she
came
into
the
king’s
presence
and
stood
before
the
king
1
29
and
the
king
sware
and
said
as
the
lord
liveth
that
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
distress
1
30
even
as
i
sware
unto
thee
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
in
my
stead
even
so
will
i
certainly
do
this
day
1
31
then
bathsheba
bowed
with
her
face
to
the
earth
and
did
reverence
to
the
king
and
said
let
my
lord
king
david
live
for
ever
1
32
and
king
david
said
call
me
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
they
came
before
the
king
1
33
the
king
also
said
unto
them
take
with
you
the
servants
of
your
lord
and
cause
solomon
my
son
to
ride
upon
mine
own
mule
and
bring
him
down
to
gihon
1
34
and
let
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
anoint
him
there
king
over
israel
and
blow
ye
with
the
trumpet
and
say
god
save
king
solomon
1
35
then
ye
shall
come
up
after
him
that
he
may
come
and
sit
upon
my
throne
for
he
shall
be
king
in
my
stead
and
i
have
appointed
him
to
be
ruler
over
israel
and
over
judah
1
36
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
answered
the
king
and
said
amen
the
lord
god
of
my
lord
the
king
say
so
too
1
37
as
the
lord
hath
been
with
my
lord
the
king
even
so
be
he
with
solomon
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
the
throne
of
my
lord
king
david
1
38
so
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
went
down
and
caused
solomon
to
ride
upon
king
david’s
mule
and
brought
him
to
gihon
1
39
and
zadok
the
priest
took
an
horn
of
oil
out
of
the
tabernacle
and
anointed
solomon
and
they
blew
the
trumpet
and
all
the
people
said
god
save
king
solomon
1
40
and
all
the
people
came
up
after
him
and
the
people
piped
with
pipes
and
rejoiced
with
great
joy
so
that
the
earth
rent
with
the
sound
of
them
1
41
and
adonijah
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
him
heard
it
as
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating
and
when
joab
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
he
said
wherefore
is
this
noise
of
the
city
being
in
an
uproar
1
42
and
while
he
yet
spake
behold
jonathan
the
son
of
abiathar
the
priest
came
and
adonijah
said
unto
him
come
in
for
thou
art
a
valiant
man
and
bringest
good
tidings
1
43
and
jonathan
answered
and
said
to
adonijah
verily
our
lord
king
david
hath
made
solomon
king
1
44
and
the
king
hath
sent
with
him
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
they
have
caused
him
to
ride
upon
the
king’s
mule
1
45
and
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
have
anointed
him
king
in
gihon
and
they
are
come
up
from
thence
rejoicing
so
that
the
city
rang
again
this
is
the
noise
that
ye
have
heard
1
46
and
also
solomon
sitteth
on
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
1
47
and
moreover
the
king’s
servants
came
to
bless
our
lord
king
david
saying
god
make
the
name
of
solomon
better
than
thy
name
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
thy
throne
and
the
king
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed
1
48
and
also
thus
said
the
king
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
hath
given
one
to
sit
on
my
throne
this
day
mine
eyes
even
seeing
it
1
49
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
adonijah
were
afraid
and
rose
up
and
went
every
man
his
way
1
50
and
adonijah
feared
because
of
solomon
and
arose
and
went
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
1
51
and
it
was
told
solomon
saying
behold
adonijah
feareth
king
solomon
for
lo
he
hath
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
saying
let
king
solomon
swear
unto
me
today
that
he
will
not
slay
his
servant
with
the
sword
1
52
and
solomon
said
if
he
will
shew
himself
a
worthy
man
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
him
fall
to
the
earth
but
if
wickedness
shall
be
found
in
him
he
shall
die
1
53
so
king
solomon
sent
and
they
brought
him
down
from
the
altar
and
he
came
and
bowed
himself
to
king
solomon
and
solomon
said
unto
him
go
to
thine
house
2
1
now
the
days
of
david
drew
nigh
that
he
should
die
and
he
charged
solomon
his
son
saying
2
2
i
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
be
thou
strong
therefore
and
shew
thyself
a
man
2
3
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
to
keep
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
and
his
judgments
and
his
testimonies
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
that
thou
mayest
prosper
in
all
that
thou
doest
and
whithersoever
thou
turnest
thyself
2
4
that
the
lord
may
continue
his
word
which
he
spake
concerning
me
saying
if
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
to
walk
before
me
in
truth
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
there
shall
not
fail
thee
(said
he)
a
man
on
the
throne
of
israel
2
5
moreover
thou
knowest
also
what
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
did
to
me
and
what
he
did
to
the
two
captains
of
the
hosts
of
israel
unto
abner
the
son
of
ner
and
unto
amasa
the
son
of
jether
whom
he
slew
and
shed
the
blood
of
war
in
peace
and
put
the
blood
of
war
upon
his
girdle
that
was
about
his
loins
and
in
his
shoes
that
were
on
his
feet
2
6
do
therefore
according
to
thy
wisdom
and
let
not
his
hoar
head
go
down
to
the
grave
in
peace
2
7
but
shew
kindness
unto
the
sons
of
barzillai
the
gileadite
and
let
them
be
of
those
that
eat
at
thy
table
for
so
they
came
to
me
when
i
fled
because
of
absalom
thy
brother
2
8
and
behold
thou
hast
with
thee
shimei
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
of
bahurim
which
cursed
me
with
a
grievous
curse
in
the
day
when
i
went
to
mahanaim
but
he
came
down
to
meet
me
at
jordan
and
i
sware
to
him
by
the
lord
saying
i
will
not
put
thee
to
death
with
the
sword
2
9
now
therefore
hold
him
not
guiltless
for
thou
art
a
wise
man
and
knowest
what
thou
oughtest
to
do
unto
him
but
his
hoar
head
bring
thou
down
to
the
grave
with
blood
2
10
so
david
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
2
11
and
the
days
that
david
reigned
over
israel
were
forty
years
seven
years
reigned
he
in
hebron
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
2
12
then
sat
solomon
upon
the
throne
of
david
his
father
and
his
kingdom
was
established
greatly
2
13
and
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
came
to
bathsheba
the
mother
of
solomon
and
she
said
comest
thou
peaceably
and
he
said
peaceably
2
14
he
said
moreover
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
thee
and
she
said
say
on
2
15
and
he
said
thou
knowest
that
the
kingdom
was
mine
and
that
all
israel
set
their
faces
on
me
that
i
should
reign
howbeit
the
kingdom
is
turned
about
and
is
become
my
brother’s
for
it
was
his
from
the
lord
2
16
and
now
i
ask
one
petition
of
thee
deny
me
not
and
she
said
unto
him
say
on
2
17
and
he
said
speak
i
pray
thee
unto
solomon
the
king
(for
he
will
not
say
thee
nay
)
that
he
give
me
abishag
the
shunammite
to
wife
2
18
and
bathsheba
said
well
i
will
speak
for
thee
unto
the
king
2
19
bathsheba
therefore
went
unto
king
solomon
to
speak
unto
him
for
adonijah
and
the
king
rose
up
to
meet
her
and
bowed
himself
unto
her
and
sat
down
on
his
throne
and
caused
a
seat
to
be
set
for
the
king’s
mother
and
she
sat
on
his
right
hand
2
20
then
she
said
i
desire
one
small
petition
of
thee
i
pray
thee
say
me
not
nay
and
the
king
said
unto
her
ask
on
my
mother
for
i
will
not
say
thee
nay
2
21
and
she
said
let
abishag
the
shunammite
be
given
to
adonijah
thy
brother
to
wife
2
22
and
king
solomon
answered
and
said
unto
his
mother
and
why
dost
thou
ask
abishag
the
shunammite
for
adonijah
ask
for
him
the
kingdom
also
for
he
is
mine
elder
brother
even
for
him
and
for
abiathar
the
priest
and
for
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
2
23
then
king
solomon
sware
by
the
lord
saying
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
adonijah
have
not
spoken
this
word
against
his
own
life
2
24
now
therefore
as
the
lord
liveth
which
hath
established
me
and
set
me
on
the
throne
of
david
my
father
and
who
hath
made
me
an
house
as
he
promised
adonijah
shall
be
put
to
death
this
day
2
25
and
king
solomon
sent
by
the
hand
of
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
he
fell
upon
him
that
he
died
2
26
and
unto
abiathar
the
priest
said
the
king
get
thee
to
anathoth
unto
thine
own
fields
for
thou
art
worthy
of
death
but
i
will
not
at
this
time
put
thee
to
death
because
thou
barest
the
ark
of
the
lord
god
before
david
my
father
and
because
thou
hast
been
afflicted
in
all
wherein
my
father
was
afflicted
2
27
so
solomon
thrust
out
abiathar
from
being
priest
unto
the
lord
that
he
might
fulfil
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
concerning
the
house
of
eli
in
shiloh
2
28
then
tidings
came
to
joab
for
joab
had
turned
after
adonijah
though
he
turned
not
after
absalom
and
joab
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
2
29
and
it
was
told
king
solomon
that
joab
was
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
behold
he
is
by
the
altar
then
solomon
sent
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
saying
go
fall
upon
him
2
30
and
benaiah
came
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
king
come
forth
and
he
said
nay
but
i
will
die
here
and
benaiah
brought
the
king
word
again
saying
thus
said
joab
and
thus
he
answered
me
2
31
and
the
king
said
unto
him
do
as
he
hath
said
and
fall
upon
him
and
bury
him
that
thou
mayest
take
away
the
innocent
blood
which
joab
shed
from
me
and
from
the
house
of
my
father
2
32
and
the
lord
shall
return
his
blood
upon
his
own
head
who
fell
upon
two
men
more
righteous
and
better
than
he
and
slew
them
with
the
sword
my
father
david
not
knowing
thereof
to
wit
abner
the
son
of
ner
captain
of
the
host
of
israel
and
amasa
the
son
of
jether
captain
of
the
host
of
judah
2
33
their
blood
shall
therefore
return
upon
the
head
of
joab
and
upon
the
head
of
his
seed
for
ever
but
upon
david
and
upon
his
seed
and
upon
his
house
and
upon
his
throne
shall
there
be
peace
for
ever
from
the
lord
2
34
so
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
went
up
and
fell
upon
him
and
slew
him
and
he
was
buried
in
his
own
house
in
the
wilderness
2
35
and
the
king
put
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
in
his
room
over
the
host
and
zadok
the
priest
did
the
king
put
in
the
room
of
abiathar
2
36
and
the
king
sent
and
called
for
shimei
and
said
unto
him
build
thee
an
house
in
jerusalem
and
dwell
there
and
go
not
forth
thence
any
whither
2
37
for
it
shall
be
that
on
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
passest
over
the
brook
kidron
thou
shalt
know
for
certain
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thy
blood
shall
be
upon
thine
own
head
2
38
and
shimei
said
unto
the
king
the
saying
is
good
as
my
lord
the
king
hath
said
so
will
thy
servant
do
and
shimei
dwelt
in
jerusalem
many
days
2
39
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
years
that
two
of
the
servants
of
shimei
ran
away
unto
achish
son
of
maachah
king
of
gath
and
they
told
shimei
saying
behold
thy
servants
be
in
gath
2
40
and
shimei
arose
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
to
gath
to
achish
to
seek
his
servants
and
shimei
went
and
brought
his
servants
from
gath
2
41
and
it
was
told
solomon
that
shimei
had
gone
from
jerusalem
to
gath
and
was
come
again
2
42
and
the
king
sent
and
called
for
shimei
and
said
unto
him
did
i
not
make
thee
to
swear
by
the
lord
and
protested
unto
thee
saying
know
for
a
certain
on
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
walkest
abroad
any
whither
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
saidst
unto
me
the
word
that
i
have
heard
is
good
2
43
why
then
hast
thou
not
kept
the
oath
of
the
lord
and
the
commandment
that
i
have
charged
thee
with
2
44
the
king
said
moreover
to
shimei
thou
knowest
all
the
wickedness
which
thine
heart
is
privy
to
that
thou
didst
to
david
my
father
therefore
the
lord
shall
return
thy
wickedness
upon
thine
own
head
2
45
and
king
solomon
shall
be
blessed
and
the
throne
of
david
shall
be
established
before
the
lord
for
ever
2
46
so
the
king
commanded
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
which
went
out
and
fell
upon
him
that
he
died
and
the
kingdom
was
established
in
the
hand
of
solomon
3
1
and
solomon
made
affinity
with
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
took
pharaoh’s
daughter
and
brought
her
into
the
city
of
david
until
he
had
made
an
end
of
building
his
own
house
and
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
wall
of
jerusalem
round
about
3
2
only
the
people
sacrificed
in
high
places
because
there
was
no
house
built
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
until
those
days
3
3
and
solomon
loved
the
lord
walking
in
the
statutes
of
david
his
father
only
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
high
places
3
4
and
the
king
went
to
gibeon
to
sacrifice
there
for
that
was
the
great
high
place
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
did
solomon
offer
upon
that
altar
3
5
in
gibeon
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
in
a
dream
by
night
and
god
said
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
3
6
and
solomon
said
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant
david
my
father
great
mercy
according
as
he
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
in
righteousness
and
in
uprightness
of
heart
with
thee
and
thou
hast
kept
for
him
this
great
kindness
that
thou
hast
given
him
a
son
to
sit
on
his
throne
as
it
is
this
day
3
7
and
now
o
lord
my
god
thou
hast
made
thy
servant
king
instead
of
david
my
father
and
i
am
but
a
little
child
i
know
not
how
to
go
out
or
come
in
3
8
and
thy
servant
is
in
the
midst
of
thy
people
which
thou
hast
chosen
a
great
people
that
cannot
be
numbered
nor
counted
for
multitude
3
9
give
therefore
thy
servant
an
understanding
heart
to
judge
thy
people
that
i
may
discern
between
good
and
bad
for
who
is
able
to
judge
this
thy
so
great
a
people
3
10
and
the
speech
pleased
the
lord
that
solomon
had
asked
this
thing
3
11
and
god
said
unto
him
because
thou
hast
asked
this
thing
and
hast
not
asked
for
thyself
long
life
neither
hast
asked
riches
for
thyself
nor
hast
asked
the
life
of
thine
enemies
but
hast
asked
for
thyself
understanding
to
discern
judgment
3
12
behold
i
have
done
according
to
thy
words
lo
i
have
given
thee
a
wise
and
an
understanding
heart
so
that
there
was
none
like
thee
before
thee
neither
after
thee
shall
any
arise
like
unto
thee
3
13
and
i
have
also
given
thee
that
which
thou
hast
not
asked
both
riches
and
honour
so
that
there
shall
not
be
any
among
the
kings
like
unto
thee
all
thy
days
3
14
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
as
thy
father
david
did
walk
then
i
will
lengthen
thy
days
3
15
and
solomon
awoke
and
behold
it
was
a
dream
and
he
came
to
jerusalem
and
stood
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
offered
peace
offerings
and
made
a
feast
to
all
his
servants
3
16
then
came
there
two
women
that
were
harlots
unto
the
king
and
stood
before
him
3
17
and
the
one
woman
said
o
my
lord
i
and
this
woman
dwell
in
one
house
and
i
was
delivered
of
a
child
with
her
in
the
house
3
18
and
it
came
to
pass
the
third
day
after
that
i
was
delivered
that
this
woman
was
delivered
also
and
we
were
together
there
was
no
stranger
with
us
in
the
house
save
we
two
in
the
house
3
19
and
this
woman’s
child
died
in
the
night
because
she
overlaid
it
3
20
and
she
arose
at
midnight
and
took
my
son
from
beside
me
while
thine
handmaid
slept
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom
and
laid
her
dead
child
in
my
bosom
3
21
and
when
i
rose
in
the
morning
to
give
my
child
suck
behold
it
was
dead
but
when
i
had
considered
it
in
the
morning
behold
it
was
not
my
son
which
i
did
bear
3
22
and
the
other
woman
said
nay
but
the
living
is
my
son
and
the
dead
is
thy
son
and
this
said
no
but
the
dead
is
thy
son
and
the
living
is
my
son
thus
they
spake
before
the
king
3
23
then
said
the
king
the
one
saith
this
is
my
son
that
liveth
and
thy
son
is
the
dead
and
the
other
saith
nay
but
thy
son
is
the
dead
and
my
son
is
the
living
3
24
and
the
king
said
bring
me
a
sword
and
they
brought
a
sword
before
the
king
3
25
and
the
king
said
divide
the
living
child
in
two
and
give
half
to
the
one
and
half
to
the
other
3
26
then
spake
the
woman
whose
the
living
child
was
unto
the
king
for
her
bowels
yearned
upon
her
son
and
she
said
o
my
lord
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
no
wise
slay
it
but
the
other
said
let
it
be
neither
mine
nor
thine
but
divide
it
3
27
then
the
king
answered
and
said
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
no
wise
slay
it
she
is
the
mother
thereof
3
28
and
all
israel
heard
of
the
judgment
which
the
king
had
judged
and
they
feared
the
king
for
they
saw
that
the
wisdom
of
god
was
in
him
to
do
judgment

judah
and

were
many
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
in
multitude
eating
and
drinking
and
making
merry
4
21
and
solomon
reigned
over
all
kingdoms
from
the
river
unto
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
unto
the
border
of
egypt
they

for

region
on

side
the
river
from

even
to

over
all
the
kings
on

side
the
river
and
he
had
peace
on

sides
round

4
25
and
judah
and
israel
dwelt
safely
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under

tree
from
dan
even
to

all

4
26
and

horses
for

chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
4
27
and
those
officers
provided
victual
for
king

and
for
all
that
came
unto
king
solomon’s
table
every
man
in
his
month
they
lacked
nothing
4
28
barley
also
and
straw
for
the
horses
and
dromedaries
brought
they
unto
the
place
where
the
officers
were
every
man
according
to

charge
4
29
and
god
gave

wisdom
and
understanding
exceeding
much
and
largeness
of
heart
even
as
the
sand
that
is
on
the
sea
shore
4
30
and
solomon’s
wisdom
excelled
the
wisdom
of
all
the
children
of
the
east
country
and
all
the
wisdom
of
egypt
4
31
for
he
was
wiser
than
all
men
than
ethan
the
ezrahite
and
heman
and
chalcol
and
darda
the
sons
of
mahol
and
his
fame
was
in
all
nations
round
about
4
32
and
he
spake
three
thousand
proverbs
and
his
songs
were
a
thousand
and
five
4
33
and
he
spake
of
trees
from
the
cedar
tree
that
is
in
lebanon
even
unto
the
hyssop
that
springeth
out
of
the
wall
he
spake
also
of
beasts
and
of
fowl
and
of
creeping
things
and
of
fishes
4
34
and
there
came
of
all
people
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
solomon
from
all
kings
of
the
earth
which
had
heard
of
his
wisdom
5
1
and
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
his
servants
unto
solomon
for
he
had
heard
that
they
had
anointed
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
for
hiram
was
ever
a
lover
of
david
5
2
and
solomon
sent
to
hiram
saying
5
3
thou
knowest
how
that
david
my
father
could
not
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
for
the
wars
which
were
about
him
on
every
side
until
the
lord
put
them
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
5
4
but
now
the
lord
my
god
hath
given
me
rest
on
every
side
so
that
there
is
neither
adversary
nor
evil
occurrent
5
5
and
behold
i
purpose
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
as
the
lord
spake
unto
david
my
father
saying
thy
son
whom
i
will
set
upon
thy
throne
in
thy
room
he
shall
build
an
house
unto
my
name
5
6
now
therefore
command
thou
that
they
hew
me
cedar
trees
out
of
lebanon
and
my
servants
shall
be
with
thy
servants
and
unto
thee
will
i
give
hire
for
thy
servants
according
to
all
that
thou
shalt
appoint
for
thou
knowest
that
there
is
not
among
us
any
that
can
skill
to
hew
timber
like
unto
the
sidonians
5
7
and
it
came
to
pass
when
hiram
heard
the
words
of
solomon
that
he
rejoiced
greatly
and
said
blessed
be
the
lord
this
day
which
hath
given
unto
david
a
wise
son
over
this
great
people
5
8
and
hiram
sent
to
solomon
saying
i
have
considered
the
things
which
thou
sentest
to
me
for
and
i
will
do
all
thy
desire
concerning
timber
of
cedar
and
concerning
timber
of
fir
5
9
my
servants
shall
bring
them
down
from
lebanon
unto
the
sea
and
i
will
convey
them
by
sea
in
floats
unto
the
place
that
thou
shalt
appoint
me
and
will
cause
them
to
be
discharged
there
and
thou
shalt
receive
them
and
thou
shalt
accomplish
my
desire
in
giving
food
for
my
household
5
10
so
hiram
gave
solomon
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
according
to
all
his
desire
5
11
and
solomon
gave
hiram
twenty
thousand
measures
of
wheat
for
food
to
his
household
and
twenty
measures
of
pure
oil
thus
gave
solomon
to
hiram
year
by
year
5
12
and
the
lord
gave
solomon
wisdom
as
he
promised
him
and
there
was
peace
between
hiram
and
solomon
and
they
two
made
a
league
together
5
13
and
king
solomon
raised
a
levy
out
of
all
israel
and
the
levy
was
thirty
thousand
men
5
14
and
he
sent
them
to
lebanon
ten
thousand
a
month
by
courses
a
month
they
were
in
lebanon
and
two
months
at
home
and
adoniram
was
over
the
levy
5
15
and
solomon
had
threescore
and
ten
thousand
that
bare
burdens
and
fourscore
thousand
hewers
in
the
mountains
5
16
beside
the
chief
of
solomon’s
officers
which
were
over
the
work
three
thousand
and
three
hundred
which
ruled
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work
5
17
and
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
great
stones
costly
stones
and
hewed
stones
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
house
5
18
and
solomon’s
builders
and
hiram’s
builders
did
hew
them
and
the
stonesquarers
so
they
prepared
timber
and
stones
to
build
the
house
6
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
four
hundred
and
eightieth
year
after
the
children
of
israel
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
fourth
year
of
solomon’s
reign
over
israel
in
the
month
zif
which
is
the
second
month
that
he
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
6
2
and
the
house
which
king
solomon
built
for
the
lord
the
length
thereof
was
threescore
cubits
and
the
breadth
thereof
twenty
cubits
and
the
height
thereof
thirty
cubits
6
3
and
the
porch
before
the
temple
of
the
house
twenty
cubits
was
the
length
thereof
according
to
the
breadth
of
the
house
and
ten
cubits
was
the
breadth
thereof
before
the
house
6
4
and
for
the
house
he
made
windows
of
narrow
lights
6
5
and
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
built
chambers
round
about
against
the
walls
of
the
house
round
about
both
of
the
temple
and
of
the
oracle
and
he
made
chambers
round
about
6
6
the
nethermost
chamber
was
five
cubits
broad
and
the
middle
was
six
cubits
broad
and
the
third
was
seven
cubits
broad
for
without
in
the
wall
of
the
house
he
made
narrowed
rests
round
about
that
the
beams
should
not
be
fastened
in
the
walls
of
the
house
6
7
and
the
house
when
it
was
in
building
was
built
of
stone
made
ready
before
it
was
brought
thither
so
that
there
was
neither
hammer
nor
axe
nor
any
tool
of
iron
heard
in
the
house
while
it
was
in
building
6
8
the
door
for
the
middle
chamber
was
in
the
right
side
of
the
house
and
they
went
up
with
winding
stairs
into
the
middle
chamber
and
out
of
the
middle
into
the
third
6
9
so
he
built
the
house
and
finished
it
and
covered
the
house
with
beams
and
boards
of
cedar
6
10
and
then
he
built
chambers
against
all
the
house
five
cubits
high
and
they
rested
on
the
house
with
timber
of
cedar
6
11
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
solomon
saying
6
12
concerning
this
house
which
thou
art
in
building
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
statutes
and
execute
my
judgments
and
keep
all
my
commandments
to
walk
in
them
then
will
i
perform
my
word
with
thee
which
i
spake
unto
david
thy
father
6
13
and
i
will
dwell
among
the
children
of
israel
and
will
not
forsake
my
people
israel
6
14
so
solomon
built
the
house
and
finished
it
6
15
and
he
built
the
walls
of
the
house
within
with
boards
of
cedar
both
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
walls
of
the
ceiling
and
he
covered
them
on
the
inside
with
wood
and
covered
the
floor
of
the
house
with
planks
of
fir
6
16
and
he
built
twenty
cubits
on
the
sides
of
the
house
both
the
floor
and
the
walls
with
boards
of
cedar
he
even
built
them
for
it
within
even
for
the
oracle
even
for
the
most
holy
place
6
17
and
the
house
that
is
the
temple
before
it
was
forty
cubits
long
6
18
and
the
cedar
of
the
house
within
was
carved
with
knops
and
open
flowers

son
of
the
tribe

cast
two
pillars
of
brass
of
eighteen
cubits
high
apiece
and
a
line
of
twelve
cubits
did
compass
either
of
them
about
7

and
he
made
two
chapiters
of
molten
brass
to
set
upon
the
tops
of
the
pillars
the
height
of
the
one
chapiter
was
five

top
of
the
pillars
seven
for
the
one
chapiter
and
seven
for
the
other
chapiter
7
18
and
he
made
the
pillars
and
two
rows
round
about
upon
the
one
network
to
cover
the
chapiters
that
were
upon
the
top
with

did
he
for

network
and
the

were
two
hundred

about
upon
the
other
chapiter
7
21
and
he
set
up
the
pillars
in
the
porch
of
the
temple
and
he
set
up
the
right
pillar
and
called
the
name
thereof
jachin
and
he
set
up
the

pillar
and
called
the

7
22
and
upon
the
top
of
the
pillars
was
lily
work
so
was
the
work
of
the
pillars
finished
7
23
and
he
made
a
molten
sea
ten
cubits
from
the
one
brim
to
the
other
it
was
round
all
about
and
his
height
was
five
cubits
and
a
line
of
thirty
cubits
did
compass
it
round
about
7
24
and
under
the
brim
of
it
round
about
there
were
knops
compassing
it
ten
in
a
cubit
compassing
the
sea
round
about
the
knops
were
cast
in
two
rows
when
it
was
cast
7
25
it
stood
upon
twelve
oxen
three
looking
toward
the
north
and
three
looking
toward
the
west
and
three
looking
toward
the
south
and
three
looking
toward
the
east
and
the
sea
was
set
above
upon
them
and
all
their
hinder
parts
were
inward
7
26
and
it
was
an
hand
breadth
thick
and
the
brim
thereof
was
wrought
like
the
brim
of
a
cup
with
flowers
of
lilies
it
contained
two
thousand
baths
7
27
and
he
made
ten
bases
of
brass
four
cubits
was
the
length
of
one
base
and
four
cubits
the
breadth
thereof
and
three
cubits
the
height
of
it
7
28
and
the
work
of
the
bases
was
on
this
manner
they
had
borders
and
the
borders
were
between
the
ledges
7
29
and
on
the
borders
that
were
between
the
ledges
were
lions
oxen
and
cherubims
and
upon
the
ledges
there
was
a
base
above
and
beneath
the
lions
and
oxen
were
certain
additions
made
of
thin
work
7
30
and
every
base
had
four
brasen
wheels
and
plates
of
brass
and
the
four
corners
thereof
had
undersetters
under
the
laver
were
undersetters
molten
at
the
side
of
every
addition
7
31
and
the
mouth
of
it
within
the
chapiter
and
above
was
a
cubit
but
the
mouth
thereof
was
round
after
the
work
of
the
base
a
cubit
and
an
half
and
also
upon
the
mouth
of
it
were
gravings
with
their
borders
foursquare
not
round
7
32
and
under
the
borders
were
four
wheels
and
the
axletrees
of
the
wheels
were
joined
to
the
base
and
the
height
of
a
wheel
was
a
cubit
and
half
a
cubit
7
33
and
the
work
of
the
wheels
was
like
the
work
of
a
chariot
wheel
their
axletrees
and
their
naves
and
their
felloes
and
their
spokes
were
all
molten
7
34
and
there
were
four
undersetters
to
the
four
corners
of
one
base
and
the
undersetters
were
of
the
very
base
itself
7
35
and
in
the
top
of
the
base
was
there
a
round
compass
of
half
a
cubit
high
and
on
the
top
of
the
base
the
ledges
thereof
and
the
borders
thereof
were
of
the
same
7
36
for
on
the
plates
of
the
ledges
thereof
and
on
the
borders
thereof
he
graved
cherubims
lions
and
palm
trees
according
to
the
proportion
of
every
one
and
additions
round
about
7
37
after
this
manner
he
made
the
ten
bases
all
of
them
had
one
casting
one
measure
and
one
size
7
38
then
made
he
ten
lavers
of
brass
one
laver
contained
forty
baths
and
every
laver
was
four
cubits
and
upon
every
one
of
the
ten
bases
one
laver
7
39
and
he
put
five
bases
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
and
five
on
the
left
side
of
the
house
and
he
set
the
sea
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
eastward
over
against
the
south
7
40
and
hiram
made
the
lavers
and
the
shovels
and
the
basons
so
hiram
made
an
end
of
doing
all
the
work
that
he
made
king
solomon
for
the
house
of
the
lord
7
41
the
two
pillars
and
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
two
pillars
and
the
two
networks
to
cover
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
which
were
upon
the
top
of
the
pillars
7
42
and
four
hundred
pomegranates
for
the
two
networks
even
two
rows
of
pomegranates
for
one
network
to
cover
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
that
were
upon
the
pillars
7
43
and
the
ten
bases
and
ten
lavers
on

7
45
and
the
pots
and
the
shovels
and
the
basons
and
all
these
vessels
which
hiram
made
to
king
solomon
for
the
house
of
the
lord
were
of
bright
brass
7
46
in
the
plain
of
jordan
did
the
king
cast
them
in
the
clay
ground
between
succoth
and
zarthan
7
47
and
solomon
left
all
the
vessels
unweighed
because
they
were
exceeding
many
neither
was
the
weight
of
the
brass
found
out
7
48
and
solomon
made
all
the
vessels
that
pertained
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
the
altar
of
gold
and
the
table
of
gold
whereupon
the
shewbread
was
7
49
and
the
candlesticks
of
pure
gold
five
on

right
side
and
five
on

inner
house
the
most
holy
place
and
for
the
doors
of
the
house
to
wit
of
the
temple
7
51
so
was
ended
all
the
work
that
king
solomon
made
for
the
house
of
the
lord
and
solomon
brought
in
the
things
which
david
his

had
dedicated
even
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the

he
put

the
chief
of
the

into
the
oracle
of
the
house
to
the
most

over
the
place
of
the

and
the
cherubims
covered
the
ark
and
the
staves
thereof

8
and
they
drew
out
the
staves
that
the
ends
of
the
staves
were
seen
out
in
the
holy
place
before
the
oracle
and
they
were
not
seen
without
and
there
they
are
unto
this
day
8

there
was
nothing
in
the
ark
save
the
two
tables
of
stone
which
moses
put
there
at
horeb
when
the
lord
made
a
covenant
with
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
8
10
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
were
come
out
of
the
holy
place
that
the
cloud
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
8
11
so
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
because
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
8
12
then
spake
solomon
the

face
about
and
blessed
all
the
congregation
of
israel
(and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
stood
)
8
15
and
he
said

since
the
day
that
i
brought
forth
my
people
israel
out
of
egypt
i
chose
no
city
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
build
an
house
that
my
name
might
be
therein
but
i
chose
david
to
be
over
my
people
israel
8
17
and
it
was
in
the
heart
of
david
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
8
18
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
my
father
whereas
it
was
in
thine
heart
to
build
an
house
unto
my
name
thou
didst
well
that
it
was
in
thine
heart
8
19
nevertheless
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
but
thy
son
that
shall
come
forth
out
of
thy
loins
he
shall
build
the
house
unto
my
name
8
20
and
the
lord
hath
performed
his
word
that
he
spake
and
i
am
risen
up
in
the
room
of
david
my
father
and
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
as
the
lord
promised
and
have
built
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
8
21
and
i
have
set
there
a
place
for
the
ark
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
the
lord
which
he
made
with
our
fathers
when
he
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
8
22
and
solomon
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven
8
23
and
he
said
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
no
god
like
thee
in
heaven
above
or
on
earth
beneath
who
keepest
covenant
and
mercy
with
thy
servants
that
walk
before
thee
with
all
their
heart
8
24
who
hast
kept
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
thou
promisedst
him
thou
spakest
also
with
thy
mouth
and
hast
fulfilled
it
with
thine
hand
as
it
is
this
day
8
25
therefore
now
lord
god
of
israel
keep
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
thou
promisedst
him
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
in
my
sight
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
so
that
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
that
they
walk
before
me
as
thou
hast
walked
before
me
8
26
and
now
o
god
of
israel
let
thy
word
i
pray
thee
be
verified
which
thou
spakest
unto
thy
servant
david
my
father
8
27
but
will
god
indeed
dwell
on
the
earth
behold
the
heaven
and
heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
thee
how
much
less
this
house
that
i
have
builded
8
28
yet
have
thou
respect
unto
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
his
supplication
o
lord
my
god
to
hearken
unto
the
cry
and
to
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
before
thee
to
day
8
29
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
toward
this
house
night
and
day
even
toward
the
place
of
which
thou
hast
said
my
name
shall
be
there
that
thou
mayest
hearken
unto
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
shall
make
toward
this
place
8
30
and
hearken
thou
to
the
supplication
of
thy
servant
and
of
thy
people
israel
when
they
shall
pray
toward
this
place
and
hear
thou
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
when
thou
hearest
forgive
8
31
if
any
man
trespass
against
his
neighbour
and
an
oath
be
laid
upon
him
to
cause
him
to
swear
and
the
oath
come
before
thine
altar
in
this
house
8
32
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
do
and
judge
thy
servants
condemning
the
wicked
to
bring
his
way
upon
his
head
and
justifying
the
righteous
to
give
him
according
to
his
righteousness
8
33
when
thy
people
israel
be
smitten
down
before
the
enemy
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
and
shall
turn
again
to
thee
and
confess
thy
name
and
pray
and
make
supplication
unto
thee
in
this
house
8
34
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
people
israel
and
bring
them
again
unto
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
8
35
when
heaven
is
shut
up
and
there
is
no
rain
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
if
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
confess
thy
name
and
turn
from
their
sin
when
thou
afflictest
them
8
36
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
servants
and
of
thy
people
israel
that
thou
teach
them
the
good
way
wherein
they
should
walk
and
give
rain
upon
thy
land
which
thou
hast
given
to
thy
people
for
an
inheritance
8
37
if
there
be
in
the
land
famine
if
there
be
pestilence
blasting
mildew
locust
or
if
there
be
caterpiller
if
their
enemy
besiege
them
in
the
land
of
their
cities
whatsoever
plague
whatsoever
sickness
there
be
8
38
what
prayer
and
supplication
soever
be
made
by
any
man
or
by
all
thy
people
israel
which
shall
know
every
man
the
plague
of
his
own
heart
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
this
house
8
39
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
forgive
and
do
and
give
to
every
man
according
to
his
ways
whose
heart
thou
knowest
(for
thou
even
thou
only
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
the
children
of
men
)
8
40
that
they
may
fear
thee
all
the
days
that
they
live
in
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
8
41
moreover
concerning
a
stranger
that
is
not
of
thy
people
israel
but
cometh
out
of
a
far
country
for
thy
name’s
sake
8
42
(for
they
shall
hear
of
thy
great
name
and
of
thy
strong
hand
and
of
thy
stretched
out
arm
)
when
he
shall
come
and
pray
toward
this
house
8
43
hear
thou
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
do
according
to
all
that
the
stranger
calleth
to
thee
for
that
all
people
of
the
earth
may
know
thy
name
to
fear
thee
as
do
thy
people
israel
and
that
they
may
know
that
this
house
which
i
have
builded
is
called
by
thy
name
8
44
if
thy
people
go
out
to
battle
against
their
enemy
whithersoever
thou
shalt
send
them
and
shall
pray
unto
the
lord
toward
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
toward
the
house
that
i
have
built
for
thy
name
8
45
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
and
maintain
their
cause
8
46
if
they
sin
against
thee
(for
there
is
no
man
that
sinneth
not
)
and
thou
be
angry
with
them
and
deliver
them
to
the
enemy
so
that
they
carry
them
away
captives
unto
the
land
of
the
enemy
far
or
near
8
47
yet
if
they
shall
bethink
themselves
in
the
land
whither
they
were
carried
captives
and
repent
and
make
supplication
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
them
that
carried
them
captives
saying
we
have
sinned
and
have
done
perversely
we
have
committed
wickedness
8
48
and
so
return
unto
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
which
led
them
away
captive
and
pray
unto
thee
toward
their
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
8
49
then
hear
thou
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
maintain
their
cause
8
50
and
forgive
thy
people
that
have
sinned
against
thee
and
all
their
transgressions
wherein
they
have
transgressed
against
thee
and
give
them
compassion
before
them
who
carried
them
captive
that
they
may
have
compassion
on
them
8
51
for
they
be
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
broughtest
forth
out
of
egypt
from
the
midst
of
the
furnace
of
iron
8
52
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
unto
the
supplication
of
thy
servant
and
unto
the
supplication
of
thy
people
israel
to
hearken
unto
them
in
all
that
they
call
for
unto
thee
8
53
for
thou
didst
separate
them
from
among
all
the
people
of
the
earth
to
be
thine
inheritance
as
thou
spakest
by
the
hand
of
moses
thy
servant
when
thou
broughtest
our
fathers
out
of
egypt
o
lord
god
8
54
and
it
was
so
that
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
all
this
prayer
and
supplication
unto
the
lord
he
arose
from
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
from
kneeling
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
spread
up
to
heaven
8
55
and
he
stood
and
blessed
all
the
congregation
of
israel
with
a
loud
voice
saying
8
56
blessed
be
the
lord
that
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
israel
according
to
all
that
he
promised
there
hath
not
failed
one
word
of
all
his
good
promise
which
he
promised
by
the
hand
of
moses
his
servant
8
57
the
lord
our
god
be
with
us
as
he
was
with
our
fathers
let
him
not
leave
us
nor
forsake
us
8
58
that
he
may
incline
our
hearts
unto
him
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
which
he
commanded
our
fathers
8
59
and
let
these
my
words
wherewith
i
have
made
supplication
before
the
lord
be
nigh
unto
the
lord
our
god
day
and
night
that
he
maintain
the
cause
of
his
servant
and
the
cause
of
his
people
israel
at
all
times
as
the
matter
shall
require
8
60
that
all
the
people
of
the
earth
may
know
that
the
lord
is
god
and
that
there
is
none
else
8
61
let
your
heart
therefore
be
perfect
with
the
lord
our
god
to
walk
in
his
statutes
and
to
keep
his
commandments
as
at
this
day
8
62
and
the
king
and
all
israel
with
him
offered
sacrifice
before
the
lord
8
63
and
solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings
which
he
offered
unto
the
lord
two
and
twenty
thousand
oxen
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep
so
the
king
and
all
the
children
of
israel
dedicated
the
house
of
the
lord
8
64
the
same
day
did
the
king
hallow
the
middle
of
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
of
the
lord
for
there
he
offered
burnt
offerings
and
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
because
the
brasen
altar
that
was
before
the
lord
was
too
little
to
receive
the
burnt
offerings
and
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
8
65
and
at
that
time
solomon
held
a
feast
and
all
israel
with
him
a
great
congregation
from
the
entering
in
of
hamath
unto
the
river
of
egypt
before
the
lord
our
god
seven
days
and
seven
days
even
fourteen
days
8
66
on
the
eighth
day
he
sent
the
people
away
and
they
blessed
the
king
and
went
unto
their
tents
joyful
and
glad
of
heart
for
all
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
done
for
david
his
servant
and
for
israel
his
people
9
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
solomon
had
finished
the
building
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king’s
house
and
all
solomon’s
desire
which
he
was
pleased
to
do
9
2
that
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
the
second
time
as
he
had
appeared
unto
him
at
gibeon
9
3
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
9
4
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
david
thy
father
walked
in
integrity
of
heart
and
in
uprightness
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
wilt
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
9
5
then
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
as
i
promised
to
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
upon
the
throne
of
israel
9
6
but
if
ye
shall
at
all
turn
from
following
me
ye
or
your
children
and
will
not
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
which
i
have
set
before
you
but
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
9
7
then
will
i
cut
off
israel
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
hallowed
for
my
name
will
i
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
israel
shall
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
people
9
8
and
at
this
house
which
is
high
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished
and
shall
hiss
and
they
shall
say
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
to
this
house
9
9
and
they
shall
answer
because
they
forsook
the
lord
their
god
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
have
taken
hold
upon
other
gods
and
have
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
the
lord
brought
upon
them
all
this
evil
9
10
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
when
solomon
had
built
the
two
houses
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king’s
house
9
11
(now
hiram
the
king
of
tyre
had
furnished
solomon
with
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
and
with
gold
according
to
all
his
desire
)
that
then
king
solomon
gave
hiram
twenty
cities
in
the
land
of
galilee
9
12
and
hiram
came
out
from
tyre
to
see
the
cities
which
solomon
had
given
him
and
they
pleased
him
not
9
13
and
he
said
what
cities
are
these
which
thou
hast
given
me
my
brother
and
he
called
them
the
land
of
cabul
unto
this
day
9
14
and
hiram
sent
to
the
king
sixscore
talents
of
gold
9
15
and
this
is
the
reason
of
the
levy
which
king
solomon
raised
for
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
and
his
own
house
and
millo
and
the
wall
of
jerusalem
and
hazor
and
megiddo
and
gezer
9
16
for
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
had
gone
up
and
taken
gezer
and
burnt
it
with
fire
and
slain
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
the
city
and
given
it
for
a
present
unto
his
daughter
solomon’s
wife
9
17
and
solomon
built
gezer
and
bethhoron
the
nether
9
18
and
baalath
and
tadmor
in
the
wilderness
in
the
land
9
19
and
all
the
cities
of
store
that
solomon
had
and
cities
for
his
chariots
and
cities
for
his
horsemen
and
that
which
solomon
desired
to
build
in
jerusalem
and
in
lebanon
and
in
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
9
20
and
all
the
people
that
were
left
of
the
amorites
hittites
perizzites
hivites
and
jebusites
which
were
not
of
the
children
of
israel
9
21
their
children
that
were
left
after
them
in
the
land
whom
the
children
of
israel
also
were
not
able
utterly
to
destroy
upon
those
did
solomon
levy
a
tribute
of
bondservice
unto
this
day
9
22
but
of
the
children
of
israel
did
solomon
make
no
bondmen
but
they
were
men
of
war
and
his
servants
and
his
princes
and
his
captains
and
rulers
of
his
chariots
and
his
horsemen
9
23
these
were
the
chief
of
the
officers
that
were
over
solomon’s
work
five
hundred
and
fifty
which
bare
rule
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work
9
24
but
pharaoh’s
daughter
came
up
out
of
the
city
of
david
unto
her
house
which
solomon
had
built
for
her
then
did
he
build
millo
9
25
and
three
times
in
a
year
did
solomon
offer
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
upon
the
altar
which
he
built
unto
the
lord
and
he
burnt
incense
upon
the
altar
that
was
before
the
lord
so
he
finished
the
house
9
26
and
king
solomon
made
a
navy
of
ships
in
eziongeber
which
is
beside
eloth
on
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
in
the
land
of
edom
9
27
and
hiram
sent
in
the
navy
his
servants
shipmen
that
had
knowledge
of
the
sea
with
the
servants
of
solomon
9
28
and
they
came
to
ophir
and
fetched
from
thence
gold
four
hundred
and
twenty
talents
and
brought
it
to
king
solomon
10
1
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
heard
of
the
fame
of
solomon
concerning
the
name
of
the
lord
she
came
to
prove
him
with
hard
questions
10
2
and
she
came
to
jerusalem
with
a
very
great
train
with
camels
that
bare
spices
and
very
much
gold
and
precious
stones
and
when
she
was
come
to
solomon
she
communed
with
him
of
all
that
was
in
her
heart
10
3
and
solomon
told
her
all
her
questions
there
was
not
any
thing
hid
from
the
king
which
he
told
her
not
10
4
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
had
seen
all
solomon’s
wisdom
and
the
house
that
he
had
built
10
5
and
the
meat
of
his
table
and
the
sitting
of
his
servants
and
the
attendance
of
his
ministers
and
their
apparel
and
his
cupbearers
and
his
ascent
by
which
he
went
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her
10
6
and
she
said
to
the
king
it
was
a
true
report
that
i
heard
in
mine
own
land
of
thy
acts
and
of
thy
wisdom
10
7
howbeit
i
believed
not
the
words
until
i
came
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
it
and
behold
the
half
was
not
told
me
thy
wisdom
and
prosperity
exceedeth
the
fame
which
i
heard
10
8
happy
are
thy
men
happy
are
these
thy
servants
which
stand
continually
before
thee
and
that
hear
thy
wisdom
10
9
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
delighted
in
thee
to
set
thee
on
the
throne
of
israel
because
the
lord
loved
israel
for
ever
therefore
made
he
thee
king
to
do
judgment
and
justice
10
10
and
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of
gold
and
of
spices
very
great
store
and
precious
stones
there
came
no
more
such
abundance
of
spices
as
these
which
the
queen
of
sheba
gave
to
king
solomon
10
11
and
the
navy
also
of
hiram
that
brought
gold
from
ophir
brought
in
from
ophir
great
plenty
of
almug
trees
and
precious
stones
10
12
and
the
king
made
of
the
almug
trees
pillars
for
the
house
of
the
lord
and
for
the
king’s
house
harps
also
and
psalteries
for
singers
there
came
no
such
almug
trees
nor
were
seen
unto
this
day
10
13
and
king
solomon
gave
unto
the
queen
of
sheba
all
her
desire
whatsoever
she
asked
beside
that
which
solomon
gave
her
of
his
royal
bounty
so
she
turned
and
went
to
her
own
country
she
and
her
servants
10
14
now
the
weight
of
gold
that
came
to
solomon
in
one
year
was
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
talents
of
gold
10
15
beside
that
he
had
of
the
merchantmen
and
of
the
traffick
of
the
spice
merchants
and
of
all
the
kings
of
arabia
and
of
the
governors
of
the
country
10
16
and
king
solomon
made
two
hundred
targets
of
beaten
gold
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
went
to
one
target
10
17
and
he
made
three
hundred
shields
of
beaten
gold
three
pound
of
gold
went
to
one
shield
and
the
king
put
them
in
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
10
18
moreover
the
king
made
a
great
throne
of
ivory
and
overlaid
it
with
the
best
gold
10
19
the
throne
had
six
steps
and
the
top
of
the
throne
was
round
behind
and
there
were
stays
on
either
side
on
the
place
of
the
seat
and
two
lions
stood
beside
the
stays
10
20
and
twelve
lions
stood
there
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
six
steps
there
was
not
the
like
made
in
any
kingdom
10
21
and
all
king
solomon’s
drinking
vessels
were
of
gold
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
were
of
pure
gold
none
were
of
silver
it
was
nothing
accounted
of
in
the
days
of
solomon
10
22
for
the
king
had
at
sea
a
navy
of
tharshish
with
the
navy
of
hiram
once
in
three
years
came
the
navy
of
tharshish
bringing
gold
and
silver
ivory
and
apes
and
peacocks
10
23
so
king
solomon
exceeded
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
for
riches
and
for
wisdom
10
24
and
all
the
earth
sought
to
solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
which
god
had
put
in
his
heart
10
25
and
they
brought
every
man
his
present
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
and
garments
and
armour
and
spices
horses
and
mules
a
rate
year
by
year
10
26
and
solomon
gathered
together
chariots
and
horsemen
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
whom
he
bestowed
in
the
cities
for
chariots
and
with
the
king
at
jerusalem
10
27
and
the
king
made
silver
to
be
in
jerusalem
as
stones
and
cedars
made
he
to
be
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
vale
for
abundance
10
28
and
solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
egypt
and
linen
yarn
the
king’s
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a
price
10
29
and
a
chariot
came
up
and
went
out
of
egypt
for
six
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
so
for
all
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
for
the
kings
of
syria
did
they
bring
them
out
by
their
means
11
1
but
king
solomon
loved
many
strange
women
together
with
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
women
of
the
moabites
ammonites
edomites
zidonians
and
hittites
11
2
of
the
nations
concerning
which
the
lord
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
ye
shall
not
go
in
to
them
neither
shall
they
come
in
unto
you
for
surely
they
will
turn
away
your
heart
after
their
gods
solomon
clave
unto
these
in
love
11
3
and
he
had
seven
hundred
wives
princesses
and
three
hundred
concubines
and
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
11
4
for
it
came
to
pass
when
solomon
was
old
that
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
after
other
gods
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
the
lord
his
god
as
was
the
heart
of
david
his
father
11
5
for
solomon
went
after
ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
zidonians
and
after
milcom
the
abomination
of
the
ammonites
11
6
and
solomon
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
went
not
fully
after
the
lord
as
did
david
his
father
11
7
then
did
solomon
build
an
high
place
for
chemosh
the
abomination
of
moab
in
the
hill
that
is
before
jerusalem
and
for
molech
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
ammon
11
8
and
likewise
did
he
for
all
his
strange
wives
which
burnt
incense
and
sacrificed
unto
their
gods
11
9
and
the
lord
was
angry
with
solomon
because
his
heart
was
turned
from
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
had
appeared
unto
him
twice
11
10
and
had
commanded
him
concerning
this
thing
that
he
should
not
go
after
other
gods
but
he
kept
not
that
which
the
lord
commanded
11
11
wherefore
the
lord
said
unto
solomon
forasmuch
as
this
is
done
of
thee
and
thou
hast
not
kept
my
covenant
and
my
statutes
which
i
have
commanded
thee
i
will
surely
rend
the
kingdom
from
thee
and
will
give
it
to
thy
servant
11
12
notwithstanding
in
thy
days
i
will
not
do
it
for
david
thy
father’s
sake
but
i
will
rend
it
out
of
the
hand
of
thy
son
11
13
howbeit
i
will
not
rend
away
all
the
kingdom
but
will
give
one
tribe
to
thy
son
for
david
my
servant’s
sake
and
for
jerusalem’s
sake
which
i
have
chosen
11
14
and
the
lord
stirred
up
an
adversary
unto
solomon
hadad
the
edomite
he
was
of
the
king’s
seed
in
edom
11
15
for
it
came
to
pass
when
david
was
in
edom
and
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
gone
up
to
bury
the
slain
after
he
had
smitten
every
male
in
edom
11
16
(for
six
months
did
joab
remain
there
with
all
israel
until
he
had
cut
off
every
male
in
edom
)
11
17
that
hadad
fled
he
and
certain
edomites
of
his
father’s
servants
with
him
to
go
into
egypt
hadad
being
yet
a
little
child
11
18
and
they
arose
out
of
midian
and
came
to
paran
and
they
took
men
with
them
out
of
paran
and
they
came
to
egypt
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
which
gave
him
an
house
and
appointed
him
victuals
and
gave
him
land
11
19
and
hadad
found
great
favour
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
so
that
he
gave
him
to
wife
the
sister
of
his
own
wife
the
sister
of
tahpenes
the
queen
11
20
and
the
sister
of
tahpenes
bare
him
genubath
his
son
whom
tahpenes
weaned
in
pharaoh’s
house
and
genubath
was
in
pharaoh’s
household
among
the
sons
of
pharaoh
11
21
and
when
hadad
heard
in
egypt
that
david
slept
with
his
fathers
and
that
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
dead
hadad
said
to
pharaoh
let
me
depart
that
i
may
go
to
mine
own
country
11
22
then
pharaoh
said
unto
him
but
what
hast
thou
lacked
with
me
that
behold
thou
seekest
to
go
to
thine
own
country
and
he
answered
nothing
howbeit
let
me
go
in
any
wise
11
23
and
god
stirred
him
up
another
adversary
rezon
the
son
of
eliadah
which
fled
from
his
lord
hadadezer
king
of
zobah
11
24
and
he
gathered
men
unto
him
and
became
captain
over
a
band
when
david
slew
them
of
zobah
and
they
went
to
damascus
and
dwelt
therein
and
reigned
in
damascus
11
25
and
he
was
an
adversary
to
israel
all
the
days
of
solomon
beside
the
mischief
that
hadad
did
and
he
abhorred
israel
and
reigned
over
syria
11
26
and
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
an
ephrathite
of
zereda
solomon’s
servant
whose
mother’s
name
was
zeruah
a
widow
woman
even
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
11
27
and
this
was
the
cause
that
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
solomon
built
millo
and
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
david
his
father
11
28
and
the
man
jeroboam
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
solomon
seeing
the
young
man
that
he
was
industrious
he
made
him
ruler
over
all
the
charge
of
the
house
of
joseph
11
29
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
jeroboam
went
out
of
jerusalem
that
the
prophet
ahijah
the
shilonite
found
him
in
the
way
and
he
had
clad
himself
with
a
new
garment
and
they
two
were
alone
in
the
field
11
30
and
ahijah
caught
the
new
garment
that
was
on
him
and
rent
it
in
twelve
pieces
11
31
and
he
said
to
jeroboam
take
thee
ten
pieces
for
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
rend
the
kingdom
out
of
the
hand
of
solomon
and
will
give
ten
tribes
to
thee
11
32
(but
he
shall
have
one
tribe
for
my
servant
david’s
sake
and
for
jerusalem’s
sake
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
)
11
33
because
that
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
worshipped
ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
zidonians
chemosh
the
god
of
the
moabites
and
milcom
the
god
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
have
not
walked
in
my
ways
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
mine
eyes
and
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
as
did
david
his
father
11
34
howbeit
i
will
not
take
the
whole
kingdom
out
of
his
hand
but
i
will
make
him
prince
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
david
my
servant’s
sake
whom
i
chose
because
he
kept
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
11
35
but
i
will
take
the
kingdom
out
of
his
son’s
hand
and
will
give
it
unto
thee
even
ten
tribes
11
36
and
unto
his
son
will
i
give
one
tribe
that
david
my
servant
may
have
a
light
alway
before
me
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
me
to
put
my
name
there
11
37
and
i
will
take
thee
and
thou
shalt
reign
according
to
all
that
thy
soul
desireth
and
shalt
be
king
over
israel
11
38
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
all
that
i
command
thee
and
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
and
do
that
is
right
in
my
sight
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
as
david
my
servant
did
that
i
will
be
with
thee
and
build
thee
a
sure
house
as
i
built
for
david
and
will
give
israel
unto
thee
11
39
and
i
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
david
but
not
for
ever
11
40
solomon
sought
therefore
to
kill
jeroboam
and
jeroboam
arose
and
fled
into
egypt
unto
shishak
king
of
egypt
and
was
in
egypt
until
the
death
of
solomon
11
41
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
solomon
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
wisdom
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
acts
of
solomon
11
42
and
the
time
that
solomon
reigned
in
jerusalem
over
all
israel
was
forty
years
11
43
and
solomon
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
12
1
and
rehoboam
went
to
shechem
for
all
israel
were
come
to
shechem
to
make
him
king
12
2
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
was
yet
in
egypt
heard
of
it
(for
he
was
fled
from
the
presence
of
king
solomon
and
jeroboam
dwelt
in
egypt
)
12
3
that
they
sent
and
called
him
and
jeroboam
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
came
and
spake
unto
rehoboam
saying
12
4
thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous
now
therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
of
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
he
put
upon
us
lighter
and
we
will
serve
thee
12
5
and
he
said
unto
them
depart
yet
for
three
days
then
come
again
to
me
and
the
people
departed
12
6
and
king
rehoboam
consulted
with
the
old
men
that
stood
before
solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
lived
and
said
how
do
ye
advise
that
i
may
answer
this
people
12
7
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
if
thou
wilt
be
a
servant
unto
this
people
this
day
and
wilt
serve
them
and
answer
them
and
speak
good
words
to
them
then
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
ever
12
8
but
he
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
men
which
they
had
given
him
and
consulted
with
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
and
which
stood
before
him
12
9
and
he
said
unto
them
what
counsel
give
ye
that
we
may
answer
this
people
who
have
spoken
to
me
saying
make
the
yoke
which
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
lighter
12
10
and
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
spake
unto
him
saying
thus
shalt
thou
speak
unto
this
people
that
spake
unto
thee
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
make
thou
it
lighter
unto
us
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
my
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father’s
loins
12
11
and
now
whereas
my
father
did
lade
you
with
a
heavy
yoke
i
will
add
to
your
yoke
my
father
hath
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
12
12
so
jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
rehoboam
the
third
day
as
the
king
had
appointed
saying
come
to
me
again
the
third
day
12
13
and
the
king
answered
the
people
roughly
and
forsook
the
old
men’s
counsel
that
they
gave
him
12
14
and
spake
to
them
after
the
counsel
of
the
young
men
saying
my
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
and
i
will
add
to
your
yoke
my
father
also
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
12
15
wherefore
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
for
the
cause
was
from
the
lord
that
he
might
perform
his
saying
which
the
lord
spake
by
ahijah
the
shilonite
unto
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
12
16
so
when
all
israel
saw
that
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
them
the
people
answered
the
king
saying
what
portion
have
we
in
david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
to
your
tents
o
israel
now
see
to
thine
own
house
david
so
israel
departed
unto
their
tents
12
17
but
as
for
the
children
of
israel
which
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
rehoboam
reigned
over
them
12
18
then
king
rehoboam
sent
adoram
who
was
over
the
tribute
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
therefore
king
rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
chariot
to
flee
to
jerusalem
12
19
so
israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
david
unto
this
day
12
20
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
israel
heard
that
jeroboam
was
come
again
that
they
sent
and
called
him
unto
the
congregation
and
made
him
king
over
all
israel
there
was
none
that
followed
the
house
of
david
but
the
tribe
of
judah
only
12
21
and
when
rehoboam
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
assembled
all
the
house
of
judah
with
the
tribe
of
benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men
which
were
warriors
to
fight
against
the
house
of
israel
to
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
12
22
but
the
word
of
god
came
unto
shemaiah
the
man
of
god
saying
12
23
speak
unto
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
king
of
judah
and
unto
all
the
house
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
to
the
remnant
of
the
people
saying
12
24
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
go
up
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
return
every
man
to
his
house
for
this
thing
is
from
me
they
hearkened
therefore
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
returned
to
depart
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
12
25
then
jeroboam
built
shechem
in
mount
ephraim
and
dwelt
therein
and
went
out
from
thence
and
built
penuel
12
26
and
jeroboam
said
in
his
heart
now
shall
the
kingdom
return
to
the
house
of
david
12
27
if
this
people
go
up
to
do
sacrifice
in
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
then
shall
the
heart
of
this
people
turn
again
unto
their
lord
even
unto
rehoboam
king
of
judah
and
they
shall
kill
me
and
go
again
to
rehoboam
king
of
judah
12
28
whereupon
the
king
took
counsel
and
made
two
calves
of
gold
and
said
unto
them
it
is
too
much
for
you
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
behold
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
12
29
and
he
set
the
one
in
bethel
and
the
other
put
he
in
dan
12
30
and
this
thing
became
a
sin
for
the
people
went
to
worship
before
the
one
even
unto
dan
12
31
and
he
made
an
house
of
high
places
and
made
priests
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
which
were
not
of
the
sons
of
levi
12
32
and
jeroboam
ordained
a
feast
in
the
eighth
month
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
like
unto
the
feast
that
is
in
judah
and
he
offered
upon
the
altar
so
did
he
in
bethel
sacrificing
unto
the
calves
that
he
had
made
and
he
placed
in
bethel
the
priests
of
the
high
places
which
he
had
made
12
33
so
he
offered
upon
the
altar
which
he
had
made
in
bethel
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
eighth
month
even
in
the
month
which
he
had
devised
of
his
own
heart
and
ordained
a
feast
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
he
offered
upon
the
altar
and
burnt
incense
13
1
and
behold
there
came
a
man
of
god
out
of
judah
by
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
bethel
and
jeroboam
stood
by
the
altar
to
burn
incense
13
2
and
he
cried
against
the
altar
in
the
word
of
the
lord
and
said
o
altar
altar
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
a
child
shall
be
born
unto
the
house
of
david
josiah
by
name
and
upon
thee
shall
he
offer
the
priests
of
the
high
places
that
burn
incense
upon
thee
and
men’s
bones
shall
be
burnt
upon
thee
13
3
and
he
gave
a
sign
the
same
day
saying
this
is
the
sign
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
behold
the
altar
shall
be
rent
and
the
ashes
that
are
upon
it
shall
be
poured
out
13
4
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
jeroboam
heard
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
which
had
cried
against
the
altar
in
bethel
that
he
put
forth
his
hand
from
the
altar
saying
lay
hold
on
him
and
his
hand
which
he
put
forth
against
him
dried
up
so
that
he
could
not
pull
it
in
again
to
him
13
5
the
altar
also
was
rent
and
the
ashes
poured
out
from
the
altar
according
to
the
sign
which
the
man
of
god
had
given
by
the
word
of
the
lord
13
6
and
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
man
of
god
intreat
now
the
face
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
pray
for
me
that
my
hand
may
be
restored
me
again
and
the
man
of
god
besought
the
lord
and
the
king’s
hand
was
restored
him
again
and
became
as
it
was
before
13
7
and
the
king
said
unto
the
man
of
god
come
home
with
me
and
refresh
thyself
and
i
will
give
thee
a
reward
13
8
and
the
man
of
god
said
unto
the
king
if
thou
wilt
give
me
half
thine
house
i
will
not
go
in
with
thee
neither
will
i
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
in
this
place
13
9
for
so
was
it
charged
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
nor
turn
again
by
the
same
way
that
thou
camest
13
10
so
he
went
another
way
and
returned
not
by
the
way
that
he
came
to
bethel
13
11
now
there
dwelt
an
old
prophet
in
bethel
and
his
sons
came
and
told
him
all
the
works
that
the
man
of
god
had
done
that
day
in
bethel
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
the
king
them
they
told
also
to
their
father
13
12
and
their
father
said
unto
them
what
way
went
he
for
his
sons
had
seen
what
way
the
man
of
god
went
which
came
from
judah
13
13
and
he
said
unto
his
sons
saddle
me
the
ass
so
they
saddled
him
the
ass
and
he
rode
thereon
13
14
and
went
after
the
man
of
god
and
found
him
sitting
under
an
oak
and
he
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
man
of
god
that
camest
from
judah
and
he
said
i
am
13
15
then
he
said
unto
him
come
home
with
me
and
eat
bread
13
16
and
he
said
i
may
not
return
with
thee
nor
go
in
with
thee
neither
will
i
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
with
thee
in
this
place
13
17
for
it
was
said
to
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
thou
shalt
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
there
nor
turn
again
to
go
by
the
way
that
thou
camest
13
18
he
said
unto
him
i
am
a
prophet
also
as
thou
art
and
an
angel
spake
unto
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
bring
him
back
with
thee
into
thine
house
that
he
may
eat
bread
and
drink
water
but
he
lied
unto
him
13
19
so
he
went
back
with
him
and
did
eat
bread
in
his
house
and
drank
water
13
20
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
sat
at
the
table
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
13
21
and
he
cried
unto
the
man
of
god
that
came
from
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
forasmuch
as
thou
hast
disobeyed
the
mouth
of
the
lord
and
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
which
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
thee
13
22
but
camest
back
and
hast
eaten
bread
and
drunk
water
in
the
place
of
the
which
the
lord
did
say
to
thee
eat
no
bread
and
drink
no
water
thy
carcase
shall
not
come
unto
the
sepulchre
of
thy
fathers
13
23
and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
eaten
bread
and
after
he
had
drunk
that
he
saddled
for
him
the
ass
to
wit
for
the
prophet
whom
he
had
brought
back
13
24
and
when
he
was
gone
a
lion
met
him
by
the
way
and
slew
him
and
his
carcase
was
cast
in
the
way
and
the
ass
stood
by
it
the
lion
also
stood
by
the
carcase
13
25
and
behold
men
passed
by
and
saw
the
carcase
cast
in
the
way
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase
and
they
came
and
told
it
in
the
city
where
the
old
prophet
dwelt
13
26
and
when
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
from
the
way
heard
thereof
he
said
it
is
the
man
of
god
who
was
disobedient
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
unto
the
lion
which
hath
torn
him
and
slain
him
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
him
13
27
and
he
spake
to
his
sons
saying
saddle
me
the
ass
and
they
saddled
him
13
28
and
he
went
and
found
his
carcase
cast
in
the
way
and
the
ass
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase
the
lion
had
not
eaten
the
carcase
nor
torn
the
ass
13
29
and
the
prophet
took
up
the
carcase
of
the
man
of
god
and
laid
it
upon
the
ass
and
brought
it
back
and
the
old
prophet
came
to
the
city
to
mourn
and
to
bury
him
13
30
and
he
laid
his
carcase
in
his
own
grave
and
they
mourned
over
him
saying
alas
my
brother
13
31
and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
buried
him
that
he
spake
to
his
sons
saying
when
i
am
dead
then
bury
me
in
the
sepulchre
wherein
the
man
of
god
is
buried
lay
my
bones
beside
his
bones
13
32
for
the
saying
which
he
cried
by
the
word
of
the
lord
against
the
altar
in
bethel
and
against
all
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
are
in
the
cities
of
samaria
shall
surely
come
to
pass
13
33
after
this
thing
jeroboam
returned
not
from
his
evil
way
but
made
again
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
priests
of
the
high
places
whosoever
would
he
consecrated
him
and
he
became
one
of
the
priests
of
the
high
places
13
34
and
this
thing
became
sin
unto
the
house
of
jeroboam
even
to
cut
it
off
and
to
destroy
it
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
14
1
at
that
time
abijah
the
son
of
jeroboam
fell
sick
14
2
and
jeroboam
said
to
his
wife
arise
i
pray
thee
and
disguise
thyself
that
thou
be
not
known
to
be
the
wife
of
jeroboam
and
get
thee
to
shiloh
behold
there
is
ahijah
the
prophet
which
told
me
that
i
should
be
king
over
this
people
14
3
and
take
with
thee
ten
loaves
and
cracknels
and
a
cruse
of
honey
and
go
to
him
he
shall
tell
thee
what
shall
become
of
the
child
14
4
and
jeroboam’s
wife
did
so
and
arose
and
went
to
shiloh
and
came
to
the
house
of
ahijah
but
ahijah
could
not
see
for
his
eyes
were
set
by
reason
of
his
age
14
5
and
the
lord
said
unto
ahijah
behold
the
wife
of
jeroboam
cometh
to
ask
a
thing
of
thee
for
her
son
for
he
is
sick
thus
and
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
her
for
it
shall
be
when
she
cometh
in
that
she
shall
feign
herself
to
be
another
woman
14
6
and
it
was
so
when
ahijah
heard
the
sound
of
her
feet
as
she
came
in
at
the
door
that
he
said
come
in
thou
wife
of
jeroboam
why
feignest
thou
thyself
to
be
another
for
i
am
sent
to
thee
with
heavy
tidings
14
7
go
tell
jeroboam
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
forasmuch
as
i
exalted
thee
from
among
the
people
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
israel
14
8
and
rent
the
kingdom
away
from
the
house
of
david
and
gave
it
thee
and
yet
thou
hast
not
been
as
my
servant
david
who
kept
my
commandments
and
who
followed
me
with
all
his
heart
to
do
that
only
which
was
right
in
mine
eyes
14
9
but
hast
done
evil
above
all
that
were
before
thee
for
thou
hast
gone
and
made
thee
other
gods
and
molten
images
to
provoke
me
to
anger
and
hast
cast
me
behind
thy
back
14
10
therefore
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
the
house
of
jeroboam
and
will
cut
off
from
jeroboam
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
and
will
take
away
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
jeroboam
as
a
man
taketh
away
dung
till
it
be
all
gone
14
11
him
that
dieth
of
jeroboam
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
14
12
arise
thou
therefore
get
thee
to
thine
own
house
and
when
thy
feet
enter
into
the
city
the
child
shall
die
14
13
and
all
israel
shall
mourn
for
him
and
bury
him
for
he
only
of
jeroboam
shall
come
to
the
grave
because
in
him
there
is
found
some
good
thing
toward
the
lord
god
of
israel
in
the
house
of
jeroboam
14
14
moreover
the
lord
shall
raise
him
up
a
king
over
israel
who
shall
cut
off
the
house
of
jeroboam
that
day
but
what
even
now
14
15
for
the
lord
shall
smite
israel
as
a
reed
is
shaken
in
the
water
and
he
shall
root
up
israel
out
of
this
good
land
which
he
gave
to
their
fathers
and
shall
scatter
them
beyond
the
river
because
they
have
made
their
groves
provoking
the
lord
to
anger
14
16
and
he
shall
give
israel
up
because
of
the
sins
of
jeroboam
who
did
sin
and
who
made
israel
to
sin
14
17
and
jeroboam’s
wife
arose
and
departed
and
came
to
tirzah
and
when
she
came
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
child
died
14
18
and
they
buried
him
and
all
israel
mourned
for
him
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
his
servant
ahijah
the
prophet
14
19
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jeroboam
how
he
warred
and
how
he
reigned
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
14
20
and
the
days
which
jeroboam
reigned
were
two
and
twenty
years
and
he
slept
with
his
fathers
and
nadab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
14
21
and
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
reigned
in
judah
rehoboam
was
forty
and
one
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
the
lord
did
choose
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
put
his
name
there
and
his
mother’s
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
14
22
and
judah
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
they
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
their
sins
which
they
had
committed
above
all
that
their
fathers
had
done
14
23
for
they
also
built
them
high
places
and
images
and
groves
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
14
24
and
there
were
also
sodomites
in
the
land
and
they
did
according
to
all
the
abominations
of
the
nations
which
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
14
25
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
rehoboam
that
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
14
26
and
he
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king’s
house
he
even
took
away
all
and
he
took
away
all
the
shields
of
gold
which
solomon
had
made
14
27
and
king
rehoboam
made
in
their
stead
brasen
shields
and
committed
them
unto
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
which
kept
the
door
of
the
king’s
house
14
28
and
it
was
so
when
the
king
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
that
the
guard
bare
them
and
brought
them
back
into
the
guard
chamber
14
29
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
rehoboam
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
14
30
and
there
was
war
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
all
their
days
14
31
and
rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
his
mother’s
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
and
abijam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
15
1
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
reigned
abijam
over
judah
15
2
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
maachah
the
daughter
of
abishalom
15
3
and
he
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
his
father
which
he
had
done
before
him
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
the
lord
his
god
as
the
heart
of
david
his
father
15
4
nevertheless
for
david’s
sake
did
the
lord
his
god
give
him
a
lamp
in
jerusalem
to
set
up
his
son
after
him
and
to
establish
jerusalem
15
5
because
david
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
turned
not
aside
from
any
thing
that
he
commanded
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
save
only
in
the
matter
of
uriah
the
hittite
15
6
and
there
was
war
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
all
the
days
of
his
life
15
7
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
abijam
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
there
was
war
between
abijam
and
jeroboam
15
8
and
abijam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
15
9
and
in
the
twentieth
year
of
jeroboam
king
of
israel
reigned
asa
over
judah
15
10
and
forty
and
one
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
maachah
the
daughter
of
abishalom
15
11
and
asa
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
as
did
david
his
father
15
12
and
he
took
away
the
sodomites
out
of
the
land
and
removed
all
the
idols
that
his
fathers
had
made
15
13
and
also
maachah
his
mother
even
her
he
removed
from
being
queen
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove
and
asa
destroyed
her
idol
and
burnt
it
by
the
brook
kidron
15
14
but
the
high
places
were
not
removed
nevertheless
asa’s
heart
was
perfect
with
the
lord
all
his
days
15
15
and
he
brought
in
the
things
which
his
father
had
dedicated
and
the
things
which
himself
had
dedicated
into
the
house
of
the
lord
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
15
16
and
there
was
war
between
asa
and
baasha
king
of
israel
all
their
days
15
17
and
baasha
king
of
israel
went
up
against
judah
and
built
ramah
that
he
might
not
suffer
any
to
go
out
or
come
in
to
asa
king
of
judah
15
18
then
asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king’s
house
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
king
asa
sent
them
to
benhadad
the
son
of
tabrimon
the
son
of
hezion
king
of
syria
that
dwelt
at
damascus
saying
15
19
there
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee
and
between
my
father
and
thy
father
behold
i
have
sent
unto
thee
a
present
of
silver
and
gold
come
and
break
thy
league
with
baasha
king
of
israel
that
he
may
depart
from
me
15
20
so
benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
asa
and
sent
the
captains
of
the
hosts
which
he
had
against
the
cities
of
israel
and
smote
ijon
and
dan
and
abelbethmaachah
and
all
cinneroth
with
all
the
land
of
naphtali
15
21
and
it
came
to
pass
when
baasha
heard
thereof
that
he
left
off
building
of
ramah
and
dwelt
in
tirzah
15
22
then
king
asa
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
judah
none
was
exempted
and
they
took
away
the
stones
of
ramah
and
the
timber
thereof
wherewith
baasha
had
builded
and
king
asa
built
with
them
geba
of
benjamin
and
mizpah
15
23
the
rest
of
all
the
acts
of
asa
and
all
his
might
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
cities
which
he
built
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
nevertheless
in
the
time
of
his
old
age
he
was
diseased
in
his
feet
15
24
and
asa
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
15
25
and
nadab
the
son
of
jeroboam
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
the
second
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
and
reigned
over
israel
two
years
15
26
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
15
27
and
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
of
the
house
of
issachar
conspired
against
him
and
baasha
smote
him
at
gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
philistines
for
nadab
and
all
israel
laid
siege
to
gibbethon
15
28
even
in
the
third
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
did
baasha
slay
him
and
reigned
in
his
stead
15
29
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
reigned
that
he
smote
all
the
house
of
jeroboam
he
left
not
to
jeroboam
any
that
breathed
until
he
had
destroyed
him
according
unto
the
saying
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
ahijah
the
shilonite
15
30
because
of
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
he
sinned
and
which
he
made
israel
sin
by
his
provocation
wherewith
he
provoked
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
15
31
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
nadab
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
15
32
and
there
was
war
between
asa
and
baasha
king
of
israel
all
their
days
15
33
in
the
third
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
to
reign
over
all
israel
in
tirzah
twenty
and
four
years
15
34
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
16
1
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
against
baasha
saying
16
2
forasmuch
as
i
exalted
thee
out
of
the
dust
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
israel
and
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
hast
made
my
people
israel
to
sin
to
provoke
me
to
anger
with
their
sins
16
3
behold
i
will
take
away
the
posterity
of
baasha
and
the
posterity
of
his
house
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
16
4
him
that
dieth
of
baasha
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
of
his
in
the
fields
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
16
5
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
baasha
and
what
he
did
and
his
might
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
16
6
so
baasha
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
tirzah
and
elah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
16
7
and
also
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
came
the
word
of
the
lord
against
baasha
and
against
his
house
even
for
all
the
evil
that
he
did
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
provoking
him
to
anger
with
the
work
of
his
hands
in
being
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
and
because
he
killed
him
16
8
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
elah
the
son
of
baasha
to
reign
over
israel
in
tirzah
two
years
16
9
and
his
servant
zimri
captain
of
half
his
chariots
conspired
against
him
as
he
was
in
tirzah
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
house
of
arza
steward
of
his
house
in
tirzah
16
10
and
zimri
went
in
and
smote
him
and
killed
him
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
and
reigned
in
his
stead
16
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
began
to
reign
as
soon
as
he
sat
on
his
throne
that
he
slew
all
the
house
of
baasha
he
left
him
not
one
that
pisseth
against
a
wall
neither
of
his
kinsfolks
nor
of
his
friends
16
12
thus
did
zimri
destroy
all
the
house
of
baasha
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
against
baasha
by
jehu
the
prophet
16
13
for
all
the
sins
of
baasha
and
the
sins
of
elah
his
son
by
which
they
sinned
and
by
which
they
made
israel
to
sin
in
provoking
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities
16
14
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
elah
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
16
15
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
did
zimri
reign
seven
days
in
tirzah
and
the
people
were
encamped
against
gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
philistines
16
16
and
the
people
that
were
encamped
heard
say
zimri
hath
conspired
and
hath
also
slain
the
king
wherefore
all
israel
made
omri
the
captain
of
the
host
king
over
israel
that
day
in
the
camp
16
17
and
omri
went
up
from
gibbethon
and
all
israel
with
him
and
they
besieged
tirzah
16
18
and
it
came
to
pass
when
zimri
saw
that
the
city
was
taken
that
he
went
into
the
palace
of
the
king’s
house
and
burnt
the
king’s
house
over
him
with
fire
and
died
16
19
for
his
sins
which
he
sinned
in
doing
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
walking
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
in
his
sin
which
he
did
to
make
israel
to
sin
16
20
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
zimri
and
his
treason
that
he
wrought
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
16
21
then
were
the
people
of
israel
divided
into
two
parts
half
of
the
people
followed
tibni
the
son
of
ginath
to
make
him
king
and
half
followed
omri
16
22
but
the
people
that
followed
omri
prevailed
against
the
people
that
followed
tibni
the
son
of
ginath
so
tibni
died
and
omri
reigned
16
23
in
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
omri
to
reign
over
israel
twelve
years
six
years
reigned
he
in
tirzah
16
24
and
he
bought
the
hill
samaria
of
shemer
for
two
talents
of
silver
and
built
on
the
hill
and
called
the
name
of
the
city
which
he
built
after
the
name
of
shemer
owner
of
the
hill
samaria
16
25
but
omri
wrought
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
did
worse
than
all
that
were
before
him
16
26
for
he
walked
in
all
the
way
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
to
provoke
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities
16
27
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
omri
which
he
did
and
his
might
that
he
shewed
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
16
28
so
omri
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
samaria
and
ahab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
16
29
and
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
ahab
the
son
of
omri
to
reign
over
israel
and
ahab
the
son
of
omri
reigned
over
israel
in
samaria
twenty
and
two
years
16
30
and
ahab
the
son
of
omri
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
above
all
that
were
before
him
16
31
and
it
came
to
pass
as
if
it
had
been
a
light
thing
for
him
to
walk
in
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
that
he
took
to
wife
jezebel
the
daughter
of
ethbaal
king
of
the
zidonians
and
went
and
served
baal
and
worshipped
him
16
32
and
he
reared
up
an
altar
for
baal
in
the
house
of
baal
which
he
had
built
in
samaria
16
33
and
ahab
made
a
grove
and
ahab
did
more
to
provoke
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
than
all
the
kings
of
israel
that
were
before
him
16
34
in
his
days
did
hiel
the
bethelite
build
jericho
he
laid
the
foundation
thereof
in
abiram
his
firstborn
and
set
up
the
gates
thereof
in
his
youngest
son
segub
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
joshua
the
son
of
nun
17
1
and
elijah
the
tishbite
who
was
of
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
said
unto
ahab
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
there
shall
not
be
dew
nor
rain
these
years
but
according
to
my
word
17
2
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
17
3
get
thee
hence
and
turn
thee
eastward
and
hide
thyself
by
the
brook
cherith
that
is
before
jordan
17
4
and
it
shall
be
that
thou
shalt
drink
of
the
brook
and
i
have
commanded
the
ravens
to
feed
thee
there
17
5
so
he
went
and
did
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
for
he
went
and
dwelt
by
the
brook
cherith
that
is
before
jordan
17
6
and
the
ravens
brought
him
bread
and
flesh
in
the
morning
and
bread
and
flesh
in
the
evening
and
he
drank
of
the
brook
17
7
and
it
came
to
pass
after
a
while
that
the
brook
dried
up
because
there
had
been
no
rain
in
the
land
17
8
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
17
9
arise
get
thee
to
zarephath
which
belongeth
to
zidon
and
dwell
there
behold
i
have
commanded
a
widow
woman
there
to
sustain
thee
17
10
so
he
arose
and
went
to
zarephath
and
when
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
city
behold
the
widow
woman
was
there
gathering
of
sticks
and
he
called
to
her
and
said
fetch
me
i
pray
thee
a
little
water
in
a
vessel
that
i
may
drink
17
11
and
as
she
was
going
to
fetch
it
he
called
to
her
and
said
bring
me
i
pray
thee
a
morsel
of
bread
in
thine
hand
17
12
and
she
said
as
the
lord
thy
god
liveth
i
have
not
a
cake
but
an
handful
of
meal
in
a
barrel
and
a
little
oil
in
a
cruse
and
behold
i
am
gathering
two
sticks
that
i
may
go
in
and
dress
it
for
me
and
my
son
that
we
may
eat
it
and
die
17
13
and
elijah
said
unto
her
fear
not
go
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
but
make
me
thereof
a
little
cake
first
and
bring
it
unto
me
and
after
make
for
thee
and
for
thy
son
17
14
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
the
barrel
of
meal
shall
not
waste
neither
shall
the
cruse
of
oil
fail
until
the
day
that
the
lord
sendeth
rain
upon
the
earth
17
15
and
she
went
and
did
according
to
the
saying
of
elijah
and
she
and
he
and
her
house
did
eat
many
days
17
16
and
the
barrel
of
meal
wasted
not
neither
did
the
cruse
of
oil
fail
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
elijah
17
17
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
the
son
of
the
woman
the
mistress
of
the
house
fell
sick
and
his
sickness
was
so
sore
that
there
was
no
breath
left
in
him
17
18
and
she
said
unto
elijah
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
o
thou
man
of
god
art
thou
come
unto
me
to
call
my
sin
to
remembrance
and
to
slay
my
son
17
19
and
he
said
unto
her
give
me
thy
son
and
he
took
him
out
of
her
bosom
and
carried
him
up
into
a
loft
where
he
abode
and
laid
him
upon
his
own
bed
17
20
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
my
god
hast
thou
also
brought
evil
upon
the
widow
with
whom
i
sojourn
by
slaying
her
son
17
21
and
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
child
three
times
and
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
my
god
i
pray
thee
let
this
child’s
soul
come
into
him
again
17
22
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
elijah
and
the
soul
of
the
child
came
into
him
again
and
he
revived
17
23
and
elijah
took
the
child
and
brought
him
down
out
of
the
chamber
into
the
house
and
delivered
him
unto
his
mother
and
elijah
said
see
thy
son
liveth
17
24
and
the
woman
said
to
elijah
now
by
this
i
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
god
and
that
the
word
of
the
lord
in
thy
mouth
is
truth
18
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
in
the
third
year
saying
go
shew
thyself
unto
ahab
and
i
will
send
rain
upon
the
earth
18
2
and
elijah
went
to
shew
himself
unto
ahab
and
there
was
a
sore
famine
in
samaria
18
3
and
ahab
called
obadiah
which
was
the
governor
of
his
house
(now
obadiah
feared
the
lord
greatly
18
4
for
it
was
so
when
jezebel
cut
off
the
prophets
of
the
lord
that
obadiah
took
an
hundred
prophets
and
hid
them
by
fifty
in
a
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
)
18
5
and
ahab
said
unto
obadiah
go
into
the
land
unto
all
fountains
of
water
and
unto
all
brooks
peradventure
we
may
find
grass
to
save
the
horses
and
mules
alive
that
we
lose
not
all
the
beasts
18
6
so
they
divided
the
land
between
them
to
pass
throughout
it
ahab
went
one
way
by
himself
and
obadiah
went
another
way
by
himself
18
7
and
as
obadiah
was
in
the
way
behold
elijah
met
him
and
he
knew
him
and
fell
on
his
face
and
said
art
thou
that
my
lord
elijah
18
8
and
he
answered
him
i
am
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
18
9
and
he
said
what
have
i
sinned
that
thou
wouldest
deliver
thy
servant
into
the
hand
of
ahab
to
slay
me
18
10
as
the
lord
thy
god
liveth
there
is
no
nation
or
kingdom
whither
my
lord
hath
not
sent
to
seek
thee
and
when
they
said
he
is
not
there
he
took
an
oath
of
the
kingdom
and
nation
that
they
found
thee
not
18
11
and
now
thou
sayest
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
18
12
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
from
thee
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
carry
thee
whither
i
know
not
and
so
when
i
come
and
tell
ahab
and
he
cannot
find
thee
he
shall
slay
me
but
i
thy
servant
fear
the
lord
from
my
youth
18
13
was
it
not
told
my
lord
what
i
did
when
jezebel
slew
the
prophets
of
the
lord
how
i
hid
an
hundred
men
of
the
lord’s
prophets
by
fifty
in
a
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
18
14
and
now
thou
sayest
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
and
he
shall
slay
me
18
15
and
elijah
said
as
the
lord
of
hosts
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
i
will
surely
shew
myself
unto
him
to
day
18
16
so
obadiah
went
to
meet
ahab
and
told
him
and
ahab
went
to
meet
elijah
18
17
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
saw
elijah
that
ahab
said
unto
him
art
thou
he
that
troubleth
israel
18
18
and
he
answered
i
have
not
troubled
israel
but
thou
and
thy
father’s
house
in
that
ye
have
forsaken
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
thou
hast
followed
baalim
18
19
now
therefore
send
and
gather
to
me
all
israel
unto
mount
carmel
and
the
prophets
of
baal
four
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
prophets
of
the
groves
four
hundred
which
eat
at
jezebel’s
table
18
20
so
ahab
sent
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
gathered
the
prophets
together
unto
mount
carmel
18
21
and
elijah
came
unto
all
the
people
and
said
how
long
halt
ye
between
two
opinions
if
the
lord
be
god
follow
him
but
if
baal
then
follow
him
and
the
people
answered
him
not
a
word
18
22
then
said
elijah
unto
the
people
i
even
i
only
remain
a
prophet
of
the
lord
but
baal’s
prophets
are
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
18
23
let
them
therefore
give
us
two
bullocks
and
let
them
choose
one
bullock
for
themselves
and
cut
it
in
pieces
and
lay
it
on
wood
and
put
no
fire
under
and
i
will
dress
the
other
bullock
and
lay
it
on
wood
and
put
no
fire
under
18
24
and
call
ye
on
the
name
of
your
gods
and
i
will
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
and
the
god
that
answereth
by
fire
let
him
be
god
and
all
the
people
answered
and
said
it
is
well
spoken
18
25
and
elijah
said
unto
the
prophets
of
baal
choose
you
one
bullock
for
yourselves
and
dress
it
first
for
ye
are
many
and
call
on
the
name
of
your
gods
but
put
no
fire
under
18
26
and
they
took
the
bullock
which
was
given
them
and
they
dressed
it
and
called
on
the
name
of
baal
from
morning
even
until
noon
saying
o
baal
hear
us
but
there
was
no
voice
nor
any
that
answered
and
they
leaped
upon
the
altar
which
was
made
18
27
and
it
came
to
pass
at
noon
that
elijah
mocked
them
and
said
cry
aloud
for
he
is
a
god
either
he
is
talking
or
he
is
pursuing
or
he
is
in
a
journey
or
peradventure
he
sleepeth
and
must
be
awaked
18
28
and
they
cried
aloud
and
cut
themselves
after
their
manner
with
knives
and
lancets
till
the
blood
gushed
out
upon
them
18
29
and
it
came
to
pass
when
midday
was
past
and
they
prophesied
until
the
time
of
the
offering
of
the
evening
sacrifice
that
there
was
neither
voice
nor
any
to
answer
nor
any
that
regarded
18
30
and
elijah
said
unto
all
the
people
come
near
unto
me
and
all
the
people
came
near
unto
him
and
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
lord
that
was
broken
down
18
31
and
elijah
took
twelve
stones
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
sons
of
jacob
unto
whom
the
word
of
the
lord
came
saying
israel
shall
be
thy
name
18
32
and
with
the
stones
he
built
an
altar
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
he
made
a
trench
about
the
altar
as
great
as
would
contain
two
measures
of
seed
18
33
and
he
put
the
wood
in
order
and
cut
the
bullock
in
pieces
and
laid
him
on
the
wood
and
said
fill
four
barrels
with
water
and
pour
it
on
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
on
the
wood
18
34
and
he
said
do
it
the
second
time
and
they
did
it
the
second
time
and
he
said
do
it
the
third
time
and
they
did
it
the
third
time
18
35
and
the
water
ran
round
about
the
altar
and
he
filled
the
trench
also
with
water
18
36
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
offering
of
the
evening
sacrifice
that
elijah
the
prophet
came
near
and
said
lord
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
of
israel
let
it
be
known
this
day
that
thou
art
god
in
israel
and
that
i
am
thy
servant
and
that
i
have
done
all
these
things
at
thy
word
18
37
hear
me
o
lord
hear
me
that
this
people
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
god
and
that
thou
hast
turned
their
heart
back
again
18
38
then
the
fire
of
the
lord
fell
and
consumed
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
the
wood
and
the
stones
and
the
dust
and
licked
up
the
water
that
was
in
the
trench
18
39
and
when
all
the
people
saw
it
they
fell
on
their
faces
and
they
said
the
lord
he
is
the
god
the
lord
he
is
the
god
18
40
and
elijah
said
unto
them
take
the
prophets
of
baal
let
not
one
of
them
escape
and
they
took
them
and
elijah
brought
them
down
to
the
brook
kishon
and
slew
them
there
18
41
and
elijah
said
unto
ahab
get
thee
up
eat
and
drink
for
there
is
a
sound
of
abundance
of
rain
18
42
so
ahab
went
up
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
elijah
went
up
to
the
top
of
carmel
and
he
cast
himself
down
upon
the
earth
and
put
his
face
between
his
knees
18
43
and
said
to
his
servant
go
up
now
look
toward
the
sea
and
he
went
up
and
looked
and
said
there
is
nothing
and
he
said
go
again
seven
times
18
44
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seventh
time
that
he
said
behold
there
ariseth
a
little
cloud
out
of
the
sea
like
a
man’s
hand
and
he
said
go
up
say
unto
ahab
prepare
thy
chariot
and
get
thee
down
that
the
rain
stop
thee
not
18
45
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
mean
while
that
the
heaven
was
black
with
clouds
and
wind
and
there
was
a
great
rain
and
ahab
rode
and
went
to
jezreel
18
46
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
on
elijah
and
he
girded
up
his
loins
and
ran
before
ahab
to
the
entrance
of
jezreel
19
1
and
ahab
told
jezebel
all
that
elijah
had
done
and
withal
how
he
had
slain
all
the
prophets
with
the
sword
19
2
then
jezebel
sent
a
messenger
unto
elijah
saying
so
let
the
gods
do
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
make
not
thy
life
as
the
life
of
one
of
them
by
to
morrow
about
this
time
19
3
and
when
he
saw
that
he
arose
and
went
for
his
life
and
came
to
beersheba
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
left
his
servant
there
19
4
but
he
himself
went
a
day’s
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
came
and
sat
down
under
a
juniper
tree
and
he
requested
for
himself
that
he
might
die
and
said
it
is
enough
now
o
lord
take
away
my
life
for
i
am
not
better
than
my
fathers
19
5
and
as
he
lay
and
slept
under
a
juniper
tree
behold
then
an
angel
touched
him
and
said
unto
him
arise
and
eat
19
6
and
he
looked
and
behold
there
was
a
cake
baken
on
the
coals
and
a
cruse
of
water
at
his
head
and
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
laid
him
down
again
19
7
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
again
the
second
time
and
touched
him
and
said
arise
and
eat
because
the
journey
is
too
great
for
thee
19
8
and
he
arose
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
went
in
the
strength
of
that
meat
forty
days
and
forty
nights
unto
horeb
the
mount
of
god
19
9
and
he
came
thither
unto
a
cave
and
lodged
there
and
behold
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
him
and
he
said
unto
him
what
doest
thou
here
elijah
19
10
and
he
said
i
have
been
very
jealous
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
the
children
of
israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
i
even
i
only
am
left
and
they
seek
my
life
to
take
it
away
19
11
and
he
said
go
forth
and
stand
upon
the
mount
before
the
lord
and
behold
the
lord
passed
by
and
a
great
and
strong
wind
rent
the
mountains
and
brake
in
pieces
the
rocks
before
the
lord
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
wind
and
after
the
wind
an
earthquake
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
earthquake
19
12
and
after
the
earthquake
a
fire
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
fire
and
after
the
fire
a
still
small
voice
19
13
and
it
was
so
when
elijah
heard
it
that
he
wrapped
his
face
in
his
mantle
and
went
out
and
stood
in
the
entering
in
of
the
cave
and
behold
there
came
a
voice
unto
him
and
said
what
doest
thou
here
elijah
19
14
and
he
said
i
have
been
very
jealous
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
because
the
children
of
israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
i
even
i
only
am
left
and
they
seek
my
life
to
take
it
away
19
15
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
return
on
thy
way
to
the
wilderness
of
damascus
and
when
thou
comest
anoint
hazael
to
be
king
over
syria
19
16
and
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
shalt
thou
anoint
to
be
king
over
israel
and
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
of
abelmeholah
shalt
thou
anoint
to
be
prophet
in
thy
room
19
17
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
him
that
escapeth
the
sword
of
hazael
shall
jehu
slay
and
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
of
jehu
shall
elisha
slay
19
18
yet
i
have
left
me
seven
thousand
in
israel
all
the
knees
which
have
not
bowed
unto
baal
and
every
mouth
which
hath
not
kissed
him
19
19
so
he
departed
thence
and
found
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
who
was
plowing
with
twelve
yoke
of
oxen
before
him
and
he
with
the
twelfth
and
elijah
passed
by
him
and
cast
his
mantle
upon
him
19
20
and
he
left
the
oxen
and
ran
after
elijah
and
said
let
me
i
pray
thee
kiss
my
father
and
my
mother
and
then
i
will
follow
thee
and
he
said
unto
him
go
back
again
for
what
have
i
done
to
thee
19
21
and
he
returned
back
from
him
and
took
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
slew
them
and
boiled
their
flesh
with
the
instruments
of
the
oxen
and
gave
unto
the
people
and
they
did
eat
then
he
arose
and
went
after
elijah
and
ministered
unto
him
20
1
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
gathered
all
his
host
together
and
there
were
thirty
and
two
kings
with
him
and
horses
and
chariots
and
he
went
up
and
besieged
samaria
and
warred
against
it
20
2
and
he
sent
messengers
to
ahab
king
of
israel
into
the
city
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
benhadad
20
3
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
mine
thy
wives
also
and
thy
children
even
the
goodliest
are
mine
20
4
and
the
king
of
israel
answered
and
said
my
lord
o
king
according
to
thy
saying
i
am
thine
and
all
that
i
have
20
5
and
the
messengers
came
again
and
said
thus
speaketh
benhadad
saying
although
i
have
sent
unto
thee
saying
thou
shalt
deliver
me
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
and
thy
wives
and
thy
children
20
6
yet
i
will
send
my
servants
unto
thee
to
morrow
about
this
time
and
they
shall
search
thine
house
and
the
houses
of
thy
servants
and
it
shall
be
that
whatsoever
is
pleasant
in
thine
eyes
they
shall
put
it
in
their
hand
and
take
it
away
20
7
then
the
king
of
israel
called
all
the
elders
of
the
land
and
said
mark
i
pray
you
and
see
how
this
man
seeketh
mischief
for
he
sent
unto
me
for
my
wives
and
for
my
children
and
for
my
silver
and
for
my
gold
and
i
denied
him
not
20
8
and
all
the
elders
and
all
the
people
said
unto
him
hearken
not
unto
him
nor
consent
20
9
wherefore
he
said
unto
the
messengers
of
benhadad
tell
my
lord
the
king
all
that
thou
didst
send
for
to
thy
servant
at
the
first
i
will
do
but
this
thing
i
may
not
do
and
the
messengers
departed
and
brought
him
word
again
20
10
and
benhadad
sent
unto
him
and
said
the
gods
do
so
unto
me
and
more
also
if
the
dust
of
samaria
shall
suffice
for
handfuls
for
all
the
people
that
follow
me
20
11
and
the
king
of
israel
answered
and
said
tell
him
let
not
him
that
girdeth
on
his
harness
boast
himself
as
he
that
putteth
it
off
20
12
and
it
came
to
pass
when
benhadad
heard
this
message
as
he
was
drinking
he
and
the
kings
in
the
pavilions
that
he
said
unto
his
servants
set
yourselves
in
array
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
the
city
20
13
and
behold
there
came
a
prophet
unto
ahab
king
of
israel
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hast
thou
seen
all
this
great
multitude
behold
i
will
deliver
it
into
thine
hand
this
day
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
20
14
and
ahab
said
by
whom
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
even
by
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
then
he
said
who
shall
order
the
battle
and
he
answered
thou
20
15
then
he
numbered
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
and
they
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
two
and
after
them
he
numbered
all
the
people
even
all
the
children
of
israel
being
seven
thousand
20
16
and
they
went
out
at
noon
but
benhadad
was
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
pavilions
he
and
the
kings
the
thirty
and
two
kings
that
helped
him
20
17
and
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
went
out
first
and
benhadad
sent
out
and
they
told
him
saying
there
are
men
come
out
of
samaria
20
18
and
he
said
whether
they
be
come
out
for
peace
take
them
alive
or
whether
they
be
come
out
for
war
take
them
alive
20
19
so
these
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
came
out
of
the
city
and
the
army
which
followed
them
20
20
and
they
slew
every
one
his
man
and
the
syrians
fled
and
israel
pursued
them
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
escaped
on
an
horse
with
the
horsemen
20
21
and
the
king
of
israel
went
out
and
smote
the
horses
and
chariots
and
slew
the
syrians
with
a
great
slaughter
20
22
and
the
prophet
came
to
the
king
of
israel
and
said
unto
him
go
strengthen
thyself
and
mark
and
see
what
thou
doest
for
at
the
return
of
the
year
the
king
of
syria
will
come
up
against
thee
20
23
and
the
servants
of
the
king
of
syria
said
unto
him
their
gods
are
gods
of
the
hills
therefore
they
were
stronger
than
we
but
let
us
fight
against
them
in
the
plain
and
surely
we
shall
be
stronger
than
they
20
24
and
do
this
thing
take
the
kings
away
every
man
out
of
his
place
and
put
captains
in
their
rooms
20
25
and
number
thee
an
army
like
the
army
that
thou
hast
lost
horse
for
horse
and
chariot
for
chariot
and
we
will
fight
against
them
in
the
plain
and
surely
we
shall
be
stronger
than
they
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
voice
and
did
so
20
26
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
return
of
the
year
that
benhadad
numbered
the
syrians
and
went
up
to
aphek
to
fight
against
israel
20
27
and
the
children
of
israel
were
numbered
and
were
all
present
and
went
against
them
and
the
children
of
israel
pitched
before
them
like
two
little
flocks
of
kids
but
the
syrians
filled
the
country
20
28
and
there
came
a
man
of
god
and
spake
unto
the
king
of
israel
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
because
the
syrians
have
said
the
lord
is
god
of
the
hills
but
he
is
not
god
of
the
valleys
therefore
will
i
deliver
all
this
great
multitude
into
thine
hand
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
20
29
and
they
pitched
one
over
against
the
other
seven
days
and
so
it
was
that
in
the
seventh
day
the
battle
was
joined
and
the
children
of
israel
slew
of
the
syrians
an
hundred
thousand
footmen
in
one
day
20
30
but
the
rest
fled
to
aphek
into
the
city
and
there
a
wall
fell
upon
twenty
and
seven
thousand
of
the
men
that
were
left
and
benhadad
fled
and
came
into
the
city
into
an
inner
chamber
20
31
and
his
servants
said
unto
him
behold
now
we
have
heard
that
the
kings
of
the
house
of
israel
are
merciful
kings
let
us
i
pray
thee
put
sackcloth
on
our
loins
and
ropes
upon
our
heads
and
go
out
to
the
king
of
israel
peradventure
he
will
save
thy
life
20
32
so
they
girded
sackcloth
on
their
loins
and
put
ropes
on
their
heads
and
came
to
the
king
of
israel
and
said
thy
servant
benhadad
saith
i
pray
thee
let
me
live
and
he
said
is
he
yet
alive
he
is
my
brother
20
33
now
the
men
did
diligently
observe
whether
any
thing
would
come
from
him
and
did
hastily
catch
it
and
they
said
thy
brother
benhadad
then
he
said
go
ye
bring
him
then
benhadad
came
forth
to
him
and
he
caused
him
to
come
up
into
the
chariot
20
34
and
benhadad
said
unto
him
the
cities
which
my
father
took
from
thy
father
i
will
restore
and
thou
shalt
make
streets
for
thee
in
damascus
as
my
father
made
in
samaria
then
said
ahab
i
will
send
thee
away
with
this
covenant
so
he
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
sent
him
away
20
35
and
a
certain
man
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
unto
his
neighbour
in
the
word
of
the
lord
smite
me
i
pray
thee
and
the
man
refused
to
smite
him
20
36
then
said
he
unto
him
because
thou
hast
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
behold
as
soon
as
thou
art
departed
from
me
a
lion
shall
slay
thee
and
as
soon
as
he
was
departed
from
him
a
lion
found
him
and
slew
him
20
37
then
he
found
another
man
and
said
smite
me
i
pray
thee
and
the
man
smote
him
so
that
in
smiting
he
wounded
him
20
38
so
the
prophet
departed
and
waited
for
the
king
by
the
way
and
disguised
himself
with
ashes
upon
his
face
20
39
and
as
the
king
passed
by
he
cried
unto
the
king
and
he
said
thy
servant
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
battle
and
behold
a
man
turned
aside
and
brought
a
man
unto
me
and
said
keep
this
man
if
by
any
means
he
be
missing
then
shall
thy
life
be
for
his
life
or
else
thou
shalt
pay
a
talent
of
silver
20
40
and
as
thy
servant
was
busy
here
and
there
he
was
gone
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
him
so
shall
thy
judgment
be
thyself
hast
decided
it
20
41
and
he
hasted
and
took
the
ashes
away
from
his
face
and
the
king
of
israel
discerned
him
that
he
was
of
the
prophets
20
42
and
he
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
because
thou
hast
let
go
out
of
thy
hand
a
man
whom
i
appointed
to
utter
destruction
therefore
thy
life
shall
go
for
his
life
and
thy
people
for
his
people
20
43
and
the
king
of
israel
went
to
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
and
came
to
samaria
21
1
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
naboth
the
jezreelite
had
a
vineyard
which
was
in
jezreel
hard
by
the
palace
of
ahab
king
of
samaria
21
2
and
ahab
spake
unto
naboth
saying
give
me
thy
vineyard
that
i
may
have
it
for
a
garden
of
herbs
because
it
is
near
unto
my
house
and
i
will
give
thee
for
it
a
better
vineyard
than
it
or
if
it
seem
good
to
thee
i
will
give
thee
the
worth
of
it
in
money
21
3
and
naboth
said
to
ahab
the
lord
forbid
it
me
that
i
should
give
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
unto
thee
21
4
and
ahab
came
into
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
because
of
the
word
which
naboth
the
jezreelite
had
spoken
to
him
for
he
had
said
i
will
not
give
thee
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
and
he
laid
him
down
upon
his
bed
and
turned
away
his
face
and
would
eat
no
bread
21
5
but
jezebel
his
wife
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
why
is
thy
spirit
so
sad
that
thou
eatest
no
bread
21
6
and
he
said
unto
her
because
i
spake
unto
naboth
the
jezreelite
and
said
unto
him
give
me
thy
vineyard
for
money
or
else
if
it
please
thee
i
will
give
thee
another
vineyard
for
it
and
he
answered
i
will
not
give
thee
my
vineyard
21
7
and
jezebel
his
wife
said
unto
him
dost
thou
now
govern
the
kingdom
of
israel
arise
and
eat
bread
and
let
thine
heart
be
merry
i
will
give
thee
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
21

so
she
wrote
letters
in
ahab’s
name
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal
and
sent
the
letters
unto
the
elders
and
to
the
nobles
that
were
in
his
city
dwelling
with
naboth
21
9
and
she
wrote
in
the
letters
saying
proclaim
a
fast
and
set
naboth
on
high
among
the
people
21
10
and
set
two
men
sons
of
belial
before
him
to
bear
witness
against
him
saying
thou
didst
blaspheme
god
and
the
king
and
then
carry
him
out
and
stone
him
that
he
may
die
21
11
and
the
men
of
his
city
even
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
were
the
inhabitants
in
his
city
did
as
jezebel
had
sent
unto
them
and
as
it
was
written
in
the
letters
which
she
had
sent
unto
them
21
12
they
proclaimed
a
fast
and
set
naboth
on
high
among
the
people
21
13
and
there
came
in
two
men
children
of
belial
and
sat
before
him
and
the
men
of
belial
witnessed
against
him
even
against
naboth
in
the
presence
of
the
people
saying
naboth
did
blaspheme
god
and
the
king
then
they
carried
him
forth
out
of
the
city
and
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
21
14
then
they
sent
to
jezebel
saying
naboth
is
stoned
and
is
dead
21
15
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jezebel
heard
that
naboth
was
stoned
and
was
dead
that
jezebel
said
to
ahab
arise
take
possession
of
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
which
he
refused
to
give
thee
for
money
for
naboth
is
not
alive
but
dead
21
16
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
heard
that
naboth
was
dead
that
ahab
rose
up
to
go
down
to
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
to
take
possession
of
it
21
17
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
21
18
arise
go
down
to
meet
ahab
king
of
israel
which
is
in
samaria
behold
he
is
in
the
vineyard
of
naboth
whither
he
is
gone
down
to
possess
it
21
19
and
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hast
thou
killed
and
also
taken
possession
and
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
in
the
place
where
dogs
licked
the
blood
of
naboth
shall
dogs
lick
thy
blood
even
thine
21
20
and
ahab
said
to
elijah
hast
thou
found
me
o
mine
enemy
and
he
answered
i
have
found
thee
because
thou
hast
sold
thyself
to
work
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
21
21
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
thee
and
will
take
away
thy
posterity
and
will
cut
off
from
ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
21
22
and
will
make
thine
house
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
like
the
house
of
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
for
the
provocation
wherewith
thou
hast
provoked
me
to
anger
and
made
israel
to
sin
21
23
and
of
jezebel
also
spake
the
lord
saying
the
dogs
shall
eat
jezebel
by
the
wall
of
jezreel
21
24
him
that
dieth
of
ahab
in
the
city
the
dogs
shall
eat
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
21
25
but
there
was
none
like
unto
ahab
which
did
sell
himself
to
work
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
whom
jezebel
his
wife
stirred
up
21
26
and
he
did
very
abominably
in
following
idols
according
to
all
things
as
did
the
amorites
whom
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
21
27
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
heard
those
words
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
flesh
and
fasted
and
lay
in
sackcloth
and
went
softly
21
28
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
21
29
seest
thou
how
ahab
humbleth
himself
before
me
because
he
humbleth
himself
before
me
i
will
not
bring
the
evil
in
his
days
but
in
his
son’s
days
will
i
bring
the
evil
upon
his
house
22
1
and
they
continued
three
years
without
war
between
syria
and
israel
22
2
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year
that
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
came
down
to
the
king
of
israel
22
3
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
his
servants
know
ye
that
ramoth
in
gilead
is
ours
and
we
be
still
and
take
it
not
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
22
4
and
he
said
unto
jehoshaphat
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
battle
to
ramothgilead
and
jehoshaphat
said
to
the
king
of
israel
i
am
as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people
my
horses
as
thy
horses
22
5
and
jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
enquire
i
pray
thee
at
the
word
of
the
lord
to
day
22
6
then
the
king
of
israel
gathered
the
prophets
together
about
four
hundred
men
and
said
unto
them
shall
i
go
against
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
they
said
go
up
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
22
7
and
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
besides
that
we
might
enquire
of
him
22
8
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
there
is
yet
one
man
micaiah
the
son
of
imlah
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
but
i
hate
him
for
he
doth
not
prophesy
good
concerning
me
but
evil
and
jehoshaphat
said
let
not
the
king
say
so
22
9
then
the
king
of
israel
called
an
officer
and
said
hasten
hither
micaiah
the
son
of
imlah
22
10
and
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
sat
each
on
his
throne
having
put
on
their
robes
in
a
void
place
in
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
samaria
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them
22
11
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
made
him
horns
of
iron
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
with
these
shalt
thou
push
the
syrians
until
thou
have
consumed
them
22
12
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so
saying
go
up
to
ramothgilead
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
king’s
hand
22
13
and
the
messenger
that
was
gone
to
call
micaiah
spake
unto
him
saying
behold
now
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
unto
the
king
with
one
mouth
let
thy
word
i
pray
thee
be
like
the
word
of
one
of
them
and
speak
that
which
is
good
22
14
and
micaiah
said
as
the
lord
liveth
what
the
lord
saith
unto
me
that
will
i
speak
22
15
so
he
came
to
the
king
and
the
king
said
unto
him
micaiah
shall
we
go
against
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
we
forbear
and
he
answered
him
go
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
22
16
and
the
king
said
unto
him
how
many
times
shall
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
tell
me
nothing
but
that
which
is
true
in
the
name
of
the
lord
22
17
and
he
said
i
saw
all
israel
scattered
upon
the
hills
as
sheep
that
have
not
a
shepherd
and
the
lord
said
these
have
no
master
let
them
return
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace
22
18
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
prophesy
no
good
concerning
me
but
evil
22
19
and
he
said
hear
thou
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
i
saw
the
lord
sitting
on
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
by
him
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
22
20
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
persuade
ahab
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
ramothgilead
and
one
said
on
this
manner
and
another
said
on
that
manner
22
21
and
there
came
forth
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
persuade
him
22
22
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
and
he
said
i
will
go
forth
and
i
will
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
he
said
thou
shalt
persuade
him
and
prevail
also
go
forth
and
do
so
22
23
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
concerning
thee
22
24
but
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
went
near
and
smote
micaiah
on
the
cheek
and
said
which
way
went
the
spirit
of
the
lord
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee
22
25
and
micaiah
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
in
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself
22
26
and
the
king
of
israel
said
take
micaiah
and
carry
him
back
unto
amon
the
governor
of
the
city
and
to
joash
the
king’s
son
22
27
and
say
thus
saith
the
king
put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction
until
i
come
in
peace
22
28
and
micaiah
said
if
thou
return
at
all
in
peace
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
by
me
and
he
said
hearken
o
people
every
one
of
you
22
29
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
went
up
to
ramothgilead
22
30
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
i
will
disguise
myself
and
enter
into
the
battle
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes
and
the
king
of
israel
disguised
himself
and
went
into
the
battle
22
31
but
the
king
of
syria
commanded
his
thirty
and
two
captains
that
had
rule
over
his
chariots
saying
fight
neither
with
small
nor
great
save
only
with
the
king
of
israel
22
32
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
jehoshaphat
that
they
said
surely
it
is
the
king
of
israel
and
they
turned
aside
to
fight
against
him
and
jehoshaphat
cried
out
22
33
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
israel
that
they
turned
back
from
pursuing
him
22
34
and
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture
and
smote
the
king
of
israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness
wherefore
he
said
unto
the
driver
of
his
chariot
turn
thine
hand
and
carry
me
out
of
the
host
for
i
am
wounded
22
35
and
the
battle
increased
that
day
and
the
king
was
stayed
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
syrians
and
died
at
even
and
the
blood
ran
out
of
the
wound
into
the
midst
of
the
chariot
22
36
and
there
went
a
proclamation
throughout
the
host
about
the
going
down
of
the
sun
saying
every
man
to
his
city
and
every
man
to
his
own
country
22
37
so
the
king
died
and
was
brought
to
samaria
and
they
buried
the
king
in
samaria
22
38
and
one
washed
the
chariot
in
the
pool
of
samaria
and
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood
and
they
washed
his
armour
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
22
39
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahab
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
ivory
house
which
he
made
and
all
the
cities
that
he
built
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
22
40
so
ahab
slept
with
his
fathers
and
ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
22
41
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
asa
began
to
reign
over
judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
ahab
king
of
israel
22
42
jehoshaphat
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
azubah
the
daughter
of
shilhi
22
43
and
he
walked
in
all
the
ways
of
asa
his
father
he
turned
not
aside
from
it
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
nevertheless
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
for
the
people
offered
and
burnt
incense
yet
in
the
high
places
22
44
and
jehoshaphat
made
peace
with
the
king
of
israel
22
45
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoshaphat
and
his
might
that
he
shewed
and
how
he
warred
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
22
46
and
the
remnant
of
the
sodomites
which
remained
in
the
days
of
his
father
asa
he
took
out
of
the
land
22
47
there
was
then
no
king
in
edom
a
deputy
was
king
22
48
jehoshaphat
made
ships
of
tharshish
to
go
to
ophir
for
gold
but
they
went
not
for
the
ships
were
broken
at
eziongeber
22
49
then
said
ahaziah
the
son
of
ahab
unto
jehoshaphat
let
my
servants
go
with
thy
servants
in
the
ships
but
jehoshaphat
would
not
22
50
and
jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
22
51
ahaziah
the
son
of
ahab
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
the
seventeenth
year
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
and
reigned
two
years
over
israel
22
52
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
in
the
way
of
his
mother
and
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
22
53
for
he
served
baal
and
worshipped
him
and
provoked
to
anger
the
lord
god
of
israel
according
to
all
that
his
father
had
done
the
second
book
of
the
kings
commonly
called
the
fourth
book
of
the
kings
1
1
then
moab
rebelled
against
israel
after
the
death
of
ahab
1
2
and
ahaziah
fell
down
through
a
lattice
in
his
upper
chamber
that
was
in
samaria
and
was
sick
and
he
sent
messengers
and
said
unto
them
go
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
whether
i
shall
recover
of
this
disease
1
3
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
to
elijah
the
tishbite
arise
go
up
to
meet
the
messengers
of
the
king
of
samaria
and
say
unto
them
is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
god
in
israel
that
ye
go
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
1
4
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
and
elijah
departed
1
5
and
when
the
messengers
turned
back
unto
him
he
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
now
turned
back
1
6
and
they
said
unto
him
there
came
a
man
up
to
meet
us
and
said
unto
us
go
turn
again
unto
the
king
that
sent
you
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
god
in
israel
that
thou
sendest
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
1
7
and
he
said
unto
them
what
manner
of
man
was
he
which
came
up
to
meet
you
and
told
you
these
words
1
8
and
they
answered
him
he
was
an
hairy
man
and
girt
with
a
girdle
of
leather
about
his
loins
and
he
said
it
is
elijah
the
tishbite
1
9
then
the
king
sent
unto
him
a
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
he
went
up
to
him
and
behold
he
sat
on
the
top
of
an
hill
and
he
spake
unto
him
thou
man
of
god
the
king
hath
said
come
down
1
10
and
elijah
answered
and
said
to
the
captain
of
fifty
if
i
be
a
man
of
god
then
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty
and
there
came
down
fire
from
heaven
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty
1
11
again
also
he
sent
unto
him
another
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
o
man
of
god
thus
hath
the
king
said
come
down
quickly
1
12
and
elijah
answered
and
said
unto
them
if
i
be
a
man
of
god
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty
and
the
fire
of
god
came
down
from
heaven
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty
1
13
and
he
sent
again
a
captain
of
the
third
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
the
third
captain
of
fifty
went
up
and
came
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
elijah
and
besought
him
and
said
unto
him
o
man
of
god
i
pray
thee
let
my
life
and
the
life
of
these
fifty
thy
servants
be
precious
in
thy
sight
1
14
behold
there
came
fire
down
from
heaven
and
burnt
up
the
two
captains
of
the
former
fifties
with
their
fifties
therefore
let
my
life
now
be
precious
in
thy
sight
1
15
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
elijah
go
down
with
him
be
not
afraid
of
him
and
he
arose
and
went
down
with
him
unto
the
king
1
16
and
he
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
forasmuch
as
thou
hast
sent
messengers
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
is
it
not
because
there
is
no
god
in
israel
to
enquire
of
his
word
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
off
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
1
17
so
he
died
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
elijah
had
spoken
and
jehoram
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
second
year
of
jehoram
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
because
he
had
no
son
1
18
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahaziah
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
2
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
lord
would
take
up
elijah
into
heaven
by
a
whirlwind
that
elijah
went
with
elisha
from
gilgal
2
2
and
elijah
said
unto
elisha
tarry
here
i
pray
thee
for
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
bethel
and
elisha
said
unto
him
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
so
they
went
down
to
bethel
2
3
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
bethel
came
forth
to
elisha
and
said
unto
him
knowest
thou
that
the
lord
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
to
day
and
he
said
yea
i
know
it
hold
ye
your
peace
2
4
and
elijah
said
unto
him
elisha
tarry
here
i
pray
thee
for
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
jericho
and
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
so
they
came
to
jericho
2
5
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
jericho
came
to
elisha
and
said
unto
him
knowest
thou
that
the
lord
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
to
day
and
he
answered
yea
i
know
it
hold
ye
your
peace
2
6
and
elijah
said
unto
him
tarry
i
pray
thee
here
for
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
jordan
and
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
and
they
two
went
on
2
7
and
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
went
and
stood
to
view
afar
off
and
they
two
stood
by
jordan
2
8
and
elijah
took
his
mantle
and
wrapped
it
together
and
smote
the
waters
and
they
were
divided
hither
and
thither
so
that
they
two
went
over
on
dry
ground
2
9
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
gone
over
that
elijah
said
unto
elisha
ask
what
i
shall
do
for
thee
before
i
be
taken
away
from
thee
and
elisha
said
i
pray
thee
let
a
double
portion
of
thy
spirit
be
upon
me
2
10
and
he
said
thou
hast
asked
a
hard
thing
nevertheless
if
thou
see
me
when
i
am
taken
from
thee
it
shall
be
so
unto
thee
but
if
not
it
shall
not
be
so
2
11
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
still
went
on
and
talked
that
behold
there
appeared
a
chariot
of
fire
and
horses
of
fire
and
parted
them
both
asunder
and
elijah
went
up
by
a
whirlwind
into
heaven
2
12
and
elisha
saw
it
and
he
cried
my
father
my
father
the
chariot
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
and
he
saw
him
no
more
and
he
took
hold
of
his
own
clothes
and
rent
them
in
two
pieces
2
13
he
took
up
also
the
mantle
of
elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
went
back
and
stood
by
the
bank
of
jordan
2
14
and
he
took
the
mantle
of
elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
smote
the
waters
and
said
where
is
the
lord
god
of
elijah
and
when
he
also
had
smitten
the
waters
they
parted
hither
and
thither
and
elisha
went
over
2
15
and
when
the
sons
of
the
prophets
which
were
to
view
at
jericho
saw
him
they
said
the
spirit
of
elijah
doth
rest
on
elisha
and
they
came
to
meet
him
and
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
before
him
2
16
and
they
said
unto
him
behold
now
there
be
with
thy
servants
fifty
strong
men
let
them
go
we
pray
thee
and
seek
thy
master
lest
peradventure
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
taken
him
up
and
cast
him
upon
some
mountain
or
into
some
valley
and
he
said
ye
shall
not
send
2
17
and
when
they
urged
him
till
he
was
ashamed
he
said
send
they
sent
therefore
fifty
men
and
they
sought
three
days
but
found
him
not
2
18
and
when
they
came
again
to
him
(for
he
tarried
at
jericho
)
he
said
unto
them
did
i
not
say
unto
you
go
not
2
19
and
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
elisha
behold
i
pray
thee
the
situation
of
this
city
is
pleasant
as
my
lord
seeth
but
the
water
is
naught
and
the
ground
barren
2
20
and
he
said
bring
me
a
new
cruse
and
put
salt
therein
and
they
brought
it
to
him
2
21
and
he
went
forth
unto
the
spring
of
the
waters
and
cast
the
salt
in
there
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
healed
these
waters
there
shall
not
be
from
thence
any
more
death
or
barren
land
2
22
so
the
waters
were
healed
unto
this
day
according
to
the
saying
of
elisha
which
he
spake
2
23
and
he
went
up
from
thence
unto
bethel
and
as
he
was
going
up
by
the
way
there
came
forth
little
children
out
of
the
city
and
mocked
him
and
said
unto
him
go
up
thou
bald
head
go
up
thou
bald
head
2
24
and
he
turned
back
and
looked
on
them
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
there
came
forth
two
she
bears
out
of
the
wood
and
tare
forty
and
two
children
of
them
2
25
and
he
went
from
thence
to
mount
carmel
and
from
thence
he
returned
to
samaria
3
1
now
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
the
eighteenth
year
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
and
reigned
twelve
years
3
2
and
he
wrought
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
not
like
his
father
and
like
his
mother
for
he
put
away
the
image
of
baal
that
his
father
had
made
3
3
nevertheless
he
cleaved
unto
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
which
made
israel
to
sin
he
departed
not
therefrom
3
4
and
mesha
king
of
moab
was
a
sheepmaster
and
rendered
unto
the
king
of
israel
an
hundred
thousand
lambs
and
an
hundred
thousand
rams
with
the
wool
3
5
but
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
was
dead
that
the
king
of
moab
rebelled
against
the
king
of
israel
3
6
and
king
jehoram
went
out
of
samaria
the
same
time
and
numbered
all
israel
3
7
and
he
went
and
sent
to
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
saying
the
king
of
moab
hath
rebelled
against
me
wilt
thou
go
with
me
against
moab
to
battle
and
he
said
i
will
go
up
i
am
as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people
and
my
horses
as
thy
horses
3
8
and
he
said
which
way
shall
we
go
up
and
he
answered
the
way
through
the
wilderness
of
edom
3
9
so
the
king
of
israel
went
and
the
king
of
judah
and
the
king
of
edom
and
they
fetched
a
compass
of
seven
days’
journey
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
host
and
for
the
cattle
that
followed
them
3
10
and
the
king
of
israel
said
alas
that
the
lord
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
moab
3
11
but
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
that
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
by
him
and
one
of
the
king
of
israel’s
servants
answered
and
said
here
is
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
which
poured
water
on
the
hands
of
elijah
3
12
and
jehoshaphat
said
the
word
of
the
lord
is
with
him
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
edom
went
down
to
him
3
13
and
elisha
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
get
thee
to
the
prophets
of
thy
father
and
to
the
prophets
of
thy
mother
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
him
nay
for
the
lord
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
moab
3
14
and
elisha
said
as
the
lord
of
hosts
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
surely
were
it
not
that
i
regard
the
presence
of
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
i
would
not
look
toward
thee
nor
see
thee
3
15
but
now
bring
me
a
minstrel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
minstrel
played
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
3
16
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
make
this
valley
full
of
ditches
3
17
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
see
wind
neither
shall
ye
see
rain
yet
that
valley
shall
be
filled
with
water
that
ye
may
drink
both
ye
and
your
cattle
and
your
beasts
3
18
and
this
is
but
a
light
thing
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
he
will
deliver
the
moabites
also
into
your
hand
3
19
and
ye
shall
smite
every
fenced
city
and
every
choice
city
and
shall
fell
every
good
tree
and
stop
all
wells
of
water
and
mar
every
good
piece
of
land
with
stones
3
20
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
when
the
meat
offering
was
offered
that
behold
there
came
water
by
the
way
of
edom
and
the
country
was
filled
with
water
3
21
and
when
all
the
moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
up
to
fight
against
them
they
gathered
all
that
were
able
to
put
on
armour
and
upward
and
stood
in
the
border
3
22
and
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
water
and
the
moabites
saw
the
water
on
the
other
side
as
red
as
blood
3
23
and
they
said
this
is
blood
the
kings
are
surely
slain
and
they
have
smitten
one
another
now
therefore
moab
to
the
spoil
3
24
and
when
they
came
to
the
camp
of
israel
the
israelites
rose
up
and
smote
the
moabites
so
that
they
fled
before
them
but
they
went
forward
smiting
the
moabites
even
in
their
country
3
25
and
they
beat
down
the
cities
and
on
every
good
piece
of
land
cast
every
man
his
stone
and
filled
it
and
they
stopped
all
the
wells
of
water
and
felled
all
the
good
trees
only
in
kirharaseth
left
they
the
stones
thereof
howbeit
the
slingers
went
about
it
and
smote
it
3
26
and
when
the
king
of
moab
saw
that
the
battle
was
too
sore
for
him
he
took
with
him
seven
hundred
men
that
drew
swords
to
break
through
even
unto
the
king
of
edom
but
they
could
not
3
27
then
he
took
his
eldest
son
that
should
have
reigned
in
his
stead
and
offered
him
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
the
wall
and
there
was
great
indignation
against
israel
and
they
departed
from
him
and
returned
to
their
own
land
4
1
now
there
cried
a
certain
woman
of
the
wives
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
unto
elisha
saying
thy
servant
my
husband
is
dead
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
servant
did
fear
the
lord
and
the
creditor
is
come
to
take
unto
him
my
two
sons
to
be
bondmen
4
2
and
elisha
said
unto
her
what
shall
i
do
for
thee
tell
me
what
hast
thou
in
the
house
and
she
said
thine
handmaid
hath
not
any
thing
in
the
house
save
a
pot
of
oil
4
3
then
he
said
go
borrow
thee
vessels
abroad
of
all
thy
neighbours
even
empty
vessels
borrow
not
a
few
4
4
and
when
thou
art
come
in
thou
shalt
shut
the
door
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
sons
and
shalt
pour
out
into
all
those
vessels
and
thou
shalt
set
aside
that
which
is
full
4
5
so
she
went
from
him
and
shut
the
door
upon
her
and
upon
her
sons
who
brought
the
vessels
to
her
and
she
poured
out
4
6
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
vessels
were
full
that
she
said
unto
her
son
bring
me
yet
a
vessel
and
he
said
unto
her
there
is
not
a
vessel
more
and
the
oil
stayed
4
7
then
she
came
and
told
the
man
of
god
and
he
said
go
sell
the
oil
and
pay
thy
debt
and
live
thou
and
thy
children
of
the
rest
4
8
and
it
fell
on
a
day
that
elisha
passed
to
shunem
where
was
a
great
woman
and
she
constrained
him
to
eat
bread
and
so
it
was
that
as
oft
as
he
passed
by
he
turned
in
thither
to
eat
bread
4
9
and
she
said
unto
her
husband
behold
now
i
perceive
that
this
is
an
holy
man
of
god
which
passeth
by
us
continually
4
10
let
us
make
a
little
chamber
i
pray
thee
on
the
wall
and
let
us
set
for
him
there
a
bed
and
a
table
and
a
stool
and
a
candlestick
and
it
shall
be
when
he
cometh
to
us
that
he
shall
turn
in
thither
4
11
and
it
fell
on
a
day
that
he
came
thither
and
he
turned
into
the
chamber
and
lay
there
4
12
and
he
said
to
gehazi
his
servant
call
this
shunammite
and
when
he
had
called
her
she
stood
before
him
4
13
and
he
said
unto
him
say
now
unto
her
behold
thou
hast
been
careful
for
us
with
all
this
care
what
is
to
be
done
for
thee
wouldest
thou
be
spoken
for
to
the
king
or
to
the
captain
of
the
host
and
she
answered
i
dwell
among
mine
own
people
4
14
and
he
said
what
then
is
to
be
done
for
her
and
gehazi
answered
verily
she
hath
no
child
and
her
husband
is
old
4
15
and
he
said
call
her
and
when
he
had
called
her
she
stood
in
the
door
4
16
and
he
said
about
this
season
according
to
the
time
of
life
thou
shalt
embrace
a
son
and
she
said
nay
my
lord
thou
man
of
god
do
not
lie
unto
thine
handmaid
4
17
and
the
woman
conceived
and
bare
a
son
at
that
season
that
elisha
had
said
unto
her
according
to
the
time
of
life
4
18
and
when
the
child
was
grown
it
fell
on
a
day
that
he
went
out
to
his
father
to
the
reapers
4
19
and
he
said
unto
his
father
my
head
my
head
and
he
said
to
a
lad
carry
him
to
his
mother
4
20
and
when
he
had
taken
him
and
brought
him
to
his
mother
he
sat
on
her
knees
till
noon
and
then
died
4
21
and
she
went
up
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
of
the
man
of
god
and
shut
the
door
upon
him
and
went
out
4
22
and
she
called
unto
her
husband
and
said
send
me
i
pray
thee
one
of
the
young
men
and
one
of
the
asses
that
i
may
run
to
the
man
of
god
and
come
again
4
23
and
he
said
wherefore
wilt
thou
go
to
him
to
day
it
is
neither
new
moon
nor
sabbath
and
she
said
it
shall
be
well
4
24
then
she
saddled
an
ass
and
said
to
her
servant
drive
and
go
forward
slack
not
thy
riding
for
me
except
i
bid
thee
4
25
so
she
went
and
came
unto
the
man
of
god
to
mount
carmel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
man
of
god
saw
her
afar
off
that
he
said
to
gehazi
his
servant
behold
yonder
is
that
shunammite
4
26
run
now
i
pray
thee
to
meet
her
and
say
unto
her
is
it
well
with
thee
is
it
well
with
thy
husband
is
it
well
with
the
child
and
she
answered
it
is
well
4
27
and
when
she
came
to
the
man
of
god
to
the
hill
she
caught
him
by
the
feet
but
gehazi
came
near
to
thrust
her
away
and
the
man
of
god
said
let
her
alone
for
her
soul
is
vexed
within
her
and
the
lord
hath
hid
it
from
me
and
hath
not
told
me
4
28
then
she
said
did
i
desire
a
son
of
my
lord
did
i
not
say
do
not
deceive
me
4
29
then
he
said
to
gehazi
gird
up
thy
loins
and
take
my
staff
in
thine
hand
and
go
thy
way
if
thou
meet
any
man
salute
him
not
and
if
any
salute
thee
answer
him
not
again
and
lay
my
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child
4
30
and
the
mother
of
the
child
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
and
he
arose
and
followed
her
4
31
and
gehazi
passed
on
before
them
and
laid
the
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child
but
there
was
neither
voice
nor
hearing
wherefore
he
went
again
to
meet
him
and
told
him
saying
the
child
is
not
awaked
4
32
and
when
elisha
was
come
into
the
house
behold
the
child
was
dead
and
laid
upon
his
bed
4
33
he
went
in
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
4
34
and
he
went
up
and
lay
upon
the
child
and
put
his
mouth
upon
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
upon
his
eyes
and
his
hands
upon
his
hands
and
stretched
himself
upon
the
child
and
the
flesh
of
the
child
waxed
warm
4
35
then
he
returned
and
walked
in
the
house
to
and
fro
and
went
up
and
stretched
himself
upon
him
and
the
child
sneezed
seven
times
and
the
child
opened
his
eyes
4
36
and
he
called
gehazi
and
said
call
this
shunammite
so
he
called
her
and
when
she
was
come
in
unto
him
he
said
take
up
thy
son
4
37
then
she
went
in
and
fell
at
his
feet
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
and
took
up
her
son
and
went
out
4
38
and
elisha
came
again
to
gilgal
and
there
was
a
dearth
in
the
land
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
were
sitting
before
him
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
set
on
the
great
pot
and
seethe
pottage
for
the
sons
of
the
prophets
4
39
and
one
went
out
into
the
field
to
gather
herbs
and
found
a
wild
vine
and
gathered
thereof
wild
gourds
his
lap
full
and
came
and
shred
them
into
the
pot
of
pottage
for
they
knew
them
not
4
40
so
they
poured
out
for
the
men
to
eat
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
were
eating
of
the
pottage
that
they
cried
out
and
said
o
thou
man
of
god
there
is
death
in
the
pot
and
they
could
not
eat
thereof
4
41
but
he
said
then
bring
meal
and
he
cast
it
into
the
pot
and
he
said
pour
out
for
the
people
that
they
may
eat
and
there
was
no
harm
in
the
pot
4
42
and
there
came
a
man
from
baalshalisha
and
brought
the
man
of
god
bread
of
the
firstfruits
twenty
loaves
of
barley
and
full
ears
of
corn
in
the
husk
thereof
and
he
said
give
unto
the
people
that
they
may
eat
4
43
and
his
servitor
said
what
should
i
set
this
before
an
hundred
men
he
said
again
give
the
people
that
they
may
eat
for
thus
saith
the
lord
they
shall
eat
and
shall
leave
thereof
4
44
so
he
set
it
before
them
and
they
did
eat
and
left
thereof
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
5
1
now
naaman
captain
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
syria
was
a
great
man
with
his
master
and
honourable
because
by
him
the
lord
had
given
deliverance
unto
syria
he
was
also
a
mighty
man
in
valour
but
he
was
a
leper
5
2
and
the
syrians
had
gone
out
by
companies
and
had
brought
away
captive
out
of
the
land
of
israel
a
little
maid
and
she
waited
on
naaman’s
wife
5
3
and
she
said
unto
her
mistress
would
god
my
lord
were
with
the
prophet
that
is
in
samaria
for
he
would
recover
him
of
his
leprosy
5
4
and
one
went
in
and
told
his
lord
saying
thus
and
thus
said
the
maid
that
is
of
the
land
of
israel
5
5
and
the
king
of
syria
said
go
to
go
and
i
will
send
a
letter
unto
the
king
of
israel
and
he
departed
and
took
with
him
ten
talents
of
silver
and
six
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
ten
changes
of
raiment
5
6
and
he
brought
the
letter
to
the
king
of
israel
saying
now
when
this
letter
is
come
unto
thee
behold
i
have
therewith
sent
naaman
my
servant
to
thee
that
thou
mayest
recover
him
of
his
leprosy
5
7
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
of
israel
had
read
the
letter
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
said
am
i
god
to
kill
and
to
make
alive
that
this
man
doth
send
unto
me
to
recover
a
man
of
his
leprosy
wherefore
consider
i
pray
you
and
see
how
he
seeketh
a
quarrel
against
me
5
8
and
it
was
so
when
elisha
the
man
of
god
had
heard
that
the
king
of
israel
had
rent
his
clothes
that
he
sent
to
the
king
saying
wherefore
hast
thou
rent
thy
clothes
let
him
come
now
to
me
and
he
shall
know
that
there
is
a
prophet
in
israel
5
9
so
naaman
came
with
his
horses
and
with
his
chariot
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
elisha
5
10
and
elisha
sent
a
messenger
unto
him
saying
go
and
wash
in
jordan
seven
times
and
thy
flesh
shall
come
again
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
clean
5
11
but
naaman
was
wroth
and
went
away
and
said
behold
i
thought
he
will
surely
come
out
to
me
and
stand
and
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
and
strike
his
hand
over
the
place
and
recover
the
leper
5
12
are
not
abana
and
pharpar
rivers
of
damascus
better
than
all
the
waters
of
israel
may
i
not
wash
in
them
and
be
clean
so
he
turned
and
went
away
in
a
rage
5
13
and
his
servants
came
near
and
spake
unto
him
and
said
my
father
if
the
prophet
had
bid
thee
do
some
great
thing
wouldest
thou
not
have
done
it
how
much
rather
then
when
he
saith
to
thee
wash
and
be
clean
5
14
then
went
he
down
and
dipped
himself
seven
times
in
jordan
according
to
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
and
his
flesh
came
again
like
unto
the
flesh
of
a
little
child
and
he
was
clean
5
15
and
he
returned
to
the
man
of
god
he
and
all
his
company
and
came
and
stood
before
him
and
he
said
behold
now
i
know
that
there
is
no
god
in
all
the
earth
but
in
israel
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
take
a
blessing
of
thy
servant
5
16
but
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
i
will
receive
none
and
he
urged
him
to
take
it
but
he
refused
5
17
and
naaman
said
shall
there
not
then
i
pray
thee
be
given
to
thy
servant
two
mules’
burden
of
earth
for
thy
servant
will
henceforth
offer
neither
burnt
offering
nor
sacrifice
unto
other
gods
but
unto
the
lord
5
18
in
this
thing
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
that
when
my
master
goeth
into
the
house
of
rimmon
to
worship
there
and
he
leaneth
on
my
hand
and
i
bow
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
when
i
bow
down
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
in
this
thing
5
19
and
he
said
unto
him
go
in
peace
so
he
departed
from
him
a
little
way
5
20
but
gehazi
the
servant
of
elisha
the
man
of
god
said
behold
my
master
hath
spared
naaman
this
syrian
in
not
receiving
at
his
hands
that
which
he
brought
but
as
the
lord
liveth
i
will
run
after
him
and
take
somewhat
of
him
5
21
so
gehazi
followed
after
naaman
and
when
naaman
saw
him
running
after
him
he
lighted
down
from
the
chariot
to
meet
him
and
said
is
all
well
5
22
and
he
said
all
is
well
my
master
hath
sent
me
saying
behold
even
now
there
be
come
to
me
from
mount
ephraim
two
young
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
give
them
i
pray
thee
a
talent
of
silver
and
two
changes
of
garments
5
23
and
naaman
said
be
content
take
two
talents
and
he
urged
him
and
bound
two
talents
of
silver
in
two
bags
with
two
changes
of
garments
and
laid
them
upon
two
of
his
servants
and
they
bare
them
before
him
5
24
and
when
he
came
to
the
tower
he
took
them
from
their
hand
and
bestowed
them
in
the
house
and
he
let
the
men
go
and
they
departed
5
25
but
he
went
in
and
stood
before
his
master
and
elisha
said
unto
him
whence
comest
thou
gehazi
and
he
said
thy
servant
went
no
whither
5
26
and
he
said
unto
him
went
not
mine
heart
with
thee
when
the
man
turned
again
from
his
chariot
to
meet
thee
is
it
a
time
to
receive
money
and
to
receive
garments
and
oliveyards
and
vineyards
and
sheep
and
oxen
and
menservants
and
maidservants
5
27
the
leprosy
therefore
of
naaman
shall
cleave
unto
thee
and
unto
thy
seed
for
ever
and
he
went
out
from
his
presence
a
leper
as
white
as
snow
6
1
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
unto
elisha
behold
now
the
place
where
we
dwell
with
thee
is
too
strait
for
us
6
2
let
us
go
we
pray
thee
unto
jordan
and
take
thence
every
man
a
beam
and
let
us
make
us
a
place
there
where
we
may
dwell
and
he
answered
go
ye
6
3
and
one
said
be
content
i
pray
thee
and
go
with
thy
servants
and
he
answered
i
will
go
6
4
so
he
went
with
them
and
when
they
came
to
jordan
they
cut
down
wood
6
5
but
as
one
was
felling
a
beam
the
axe
head
fell
into
the
water
and
he
cried
and
said
alas
master
for
it
was
borrowed
6
6
and
the
man
of
god
said
where
fell
it
and
he
shewed
him
the
place
and
he
cut
down
a
stick
and
cast
it
in
thither
and
the
iron
did
swim
6
7
therefore
said
he
take
it
up
to
thee
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
it
6
8
then
the
king
of
syria
warred
against
israel
and
took
counsel
with
his
servants
saying
in
such
and
such
a
place
shall
be
my
camp
6
9
and
the
man
of
god
sent
unto
the
king
of
israel
saying
beware
that
thou
pass
not
such
a
place
for
thither
the
syrians
are
come
down
6
10
and
the
king
of
israel
sent
to
the
place
which
the
man
of
god
told
him
and
warned
him
of
and
saved
himself
there
not
once
nor
twice
6
11
therefore
the
heart
of
the
king
of
syria
was
sore
troubled
for
this
thing
and
he
called
his
servants
and
said
unto
them
will
ye
not
shew
me
which
of
us
is
for
the
king
of
israel
6
12
and
one
of
his
servants
said
none
my
lord
o
king
but
elisha
the
prophet
that
is
in
israel
telleth
the
king
of
israel
the
words
that
thou
speakest
in
thy
bedchamber
6
13
and
he
said
go
and
spy
where
he
is
that
i
may
send
and
fetch
him
and
it
was
told
him
saying
behold
he
is
in
dothan
6
14
therefore
sent
he
thither
horses
and
chariots
and
a
great
host
and
they
came
by
night
and
compassed
the
city
about
6
15
and
when
the
servant
of
the
man
of
god
was
risen
early
and
gone
forth
behold
an
host
compassed
the
city
both
with
horses
and
chariots
and
his
servant
said
unto
him
alas
my
master
how
shall
we
do
6
16
and
he
answered
fear
not
for
they
that
be
with
us
are
more
than
they
that
be
with
them
6
17
and
elisha
prayed
and
said
lord
i
pray
thee
open
his
eyes
that
he
may
see
and
the
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
and
he
saw
and
behold
the
mountain
was
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
round
about
elisha
6
18
and
when
they
came
down
to
him
elisha
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
said
smite
this
people
i
pray
thee
with
blindness
and
he
smote
them
with
blindness
according
to
the
word
of
elisha
6
19
and
elisha
said
unto
them
this
is
not
the
way
neither
is
this
the
city
follow
me
and
i
will
bring
you
to
the
man
whom
ye
seek
but
he
led
them
to
samaria
6
20
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
into
samaria
that
elisha
said
lord
open
the
eyes
of
these
men
that
they
may
see
and
the
lord
opened
their
eyes
and
they
saw
and
behold
they
were
in
the
midst
of
samaria
6
21
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
elisha
when
he
saw
them
my
father
shall
i
smite
them
shall
i
smite
them
6
22
and
he
answered
thou
shalt
not
smite
them
wouldest
thou
smite
those
whom
thou
hast
taken
captive
with
thy
sword
and
with
thy
bow
set
bread
and
water
before
them
that
they
may
eat
and
drink
and
go
to
their
master
6
23
and
he
prepared
great
provision
for
them
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
he
sent
them
away
and
they
went
to
their
master
so
the
bands
of
syria
came
no
more
into
the
land
of
israel
6
24
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
benhadad
king
of
syria
gathered
all
his
host
and
went
up
and
besieged
samaria
6
25
and
there
was
a
great
famine
in
samaria
and
behold
they
besieged
it
until
an
ass’s
head
was
sold
for
fourscore
pieces
of
silver
and
the
fourth
part
of
a
cab
of
dove’s
dung
for
five
pieces
of
silver
6
26
and
as
the
king
of
israel
was
passing
by
upon
the
wall
there
cried
a
woman
unto
him
saying
help
my
lord
o
king
6
27
and
he
said
if
the
lord
do
not
help
thee
whence
shall
i
help
thee
out
of
the
barnfloor
or
out
of
the
winepress
6
28
and
the
king
said
unto
her
what
aileth
thee
and
she
answered
this
woman
said
unto
me
give
thy
son
that
we
may
eat
him
to
day
and
we
will
eat
my
son
to
morrow
6
29
so
we
boiled
my
son
and
did
eat
him
and
i
said
unto
her
on
the
next
day
give
thy
son
that
we
may
eat
him
and
she
hath
hid
her
son
6
30
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
woman
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
he
passed
by
upon
the
wall
and
the
people
looked
and
behold
he
had
sackcloth
within
upon
his
flesh
6
31
then
he
said
god
do
so
and
more
also
to
me
if
the
head
of
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
shall
stand
on
him
this
day
6
32
but
elisha
sat
in
his
house
and
the
elders
sat
with
him
and
the
king
sent
a
man
from
before
him
but
ere
the
messenger
came
to
him
he
said
to
the
elders
see
ye
how
this
son
of
a
murderer
hath
sent
to
take
away
mine
head
look
when
the
messenger
cometh
shut
the
door
and
hold
him
fast
at
the
door
is
not
the
sound
of
his
master’s
feet
behind
him
6
33
and
while
he
yet
talked
with
them
behold
the
messenger
came
down
unto
him
and
he
said
behold
this
evil
is
of
the
lord
what
should
i
wait
for
the
lord
any
longer
7
1
then
elisha
said
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
to
morrow
about
this
time
shall
a
measure
of
fine
flour
be
sold
for
a
shekel
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
in
the
gate
of
samaria
7
2
then
a
lord
on
whose
hand
the
king
leaned
answered
the
man
of
god
and
said
behold
if
the
lord
would
make
windows
in
heaven
might
this
thing
be
and
he
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof
7
3
and
there
were
four
leprous
men
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
and
they
said
one
to
another
why
sit
we
here
until
we
die
7
4
if
we
say
we
will
enter
into
the
city
then
the
famine
is
in
the
city
and
we
shall
die
there
and
if
we
sit
still
here
we
die
also
now
therefore
come
and
let
us
fall
unto
the
host
of
the
syrians
if
they
save
us
alive
we
shall
live
and
if
they
kill
us
we
shall
but
die
7
5
and
they
rose
up
in
the
twilight
to
go
unto
the
camp
of
the
syrians
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp
of
syria
behold
there
was
no
man
there
7
6
for
the
lord
had
made
the
host
of
the
syrians
to
hear
a
noise
of
chariots
and
a
noise
of
horses
even
the
noise
of
a
great
host
and
they
said
one
to
another
lo
the
king
of
israel
hath
hired
against
us
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
the
kings
of
the
egyptians
to
come
upon
us
7
7
wherefore
they
arose
and
fled
in
the
twilight
and
left
their
tents
and
their
horses
and
their
asses
even
the
camp
as
it
was
and
fled
for
their
life
7
8
and
when
these
lepers
came
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp
they
went
into
one
tent
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
carried
thence
silver
and
gold
and
raiment
and
went
and
hid
it
and
came
again
and
entered
into
another
tent
and
carried
thence
also
and
went
and
hid
it
7
9
then
they
said
one
to
another
we
do
not
well
this
day
is
a
day
of
good
tidings
and
we
hold
our
peace
if
we
tarry
till
the
morning
light
some
mischief
will
come
upon
us
now
therefore
come
that
we
may
go
and
tell
the
king’s
household
7
10
so
they
came
and
called
unto
the
porter
of
the
city
and
they
told
them
saying
we
came
to
the
camp
of
the
syrians
and
behold
there
was
no
man
there
neither
voice
of
man
but
horses
tied
and
asses
tied
and
the
tents
as
they
were
7
11
and
he
called
the
porters
and
they
told
it
to
the
king’s
house
within
7
12
and
the
king
arose
in
the
night
and
said
unto
his
servants
i
will
now
shew
you
what
the
syrians
have
done
to
us
they
know
that
we
be
hungry
therefore
are
they
gone
out
of
the
camp
to
hide
themselves
in
the
field
saying
when
they
come
out
of
the
city
we
shall
catch
them
alive
and
get
into
the
city
7
13
and
one
of
his
servants
answered
and
said
let
some
take
i
pray
thee
five
of
the
horses
that
remain
which
are
left
in
the
city
(behold
they
are
as
all
the
multitude
of
israel
that
are
left
in
it
behold
i
say
they
are
even
as
all
the
multitude
of
the
israelites
that
are
consumed
)
and
let
us
send
and
see
7
14
they
took
therefore
two
chariot
horses
and
the
king
sent
after
the
host
of
the
syrians
saying
go
and
see
7
15
and
they
went
after
them
unto
jordan
and
lo
all
the
way
was
full
of
garments
and
vessels
which
the
syrians
had
cast
away
in
their
haste
and
the
messengers
returned
and
told
the
king
7
16
and
the
people
went
out
and
spoiled
the
tents
of
the
syrians
so
a
measure
of
fine
flour
was
sold
for
a
shekel
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
7
17
and
the
king
appointed
the
lord
on
whose
hand
he
leaned
to
have
the
charge
of
the
gate
and
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate
and
he
died
as
the
man
of
god
had
said
who
spake
when
the
king
came
down
to
him
7
18
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
man
of
god
had
spoken
to
the
king
saying
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
and
a
measure
of
fine
flour
for
a
shekel
shall
be
to
morrow
about
this
time
in
the
gate
of
samaria
7
19
and
that
lord
answered
the
man
of
god
and
said
now
behold
if
the
lord
should
make
windows
in
heaven
might
such
a
thing
be
and
he
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof
7
20
and
so
it
fell
out
unto
him
for
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate
and
he
died
8
1
then
spake
elisha
unto
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
saying
arise
and
go
thou
and
thine
household
and
sojourn
wheresoever
thou
canst
sojourn
for
the
lord
hath
called
for
a
famine
and
it
shall
also
come
upon
the
land
seven
years
8
2
and
the
woman
arose
and
did
after
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
and
she
went
with
her
household
and
sojourned
in
the
land
of
the
philistines
seven
years
8
3
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seven
years’
end
that
the
woman
returned
out
of
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
she
went
forth
to
cry
unto
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land
8
4
and
the
king
talked
with
gehazi
the
servant
of
the
man
of
god
saying
tell
me
i
pray
thee
all
the
great
things
that
elisha
hath
done
8
5
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
telling
the
king
how
he
had
restored
a
dead
body
to
life
that
behold
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
cried
to
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land
and
gehazi
said
my
lord
o
king
this
is
the
woman
and
this
is
her
son
whom
elisha
restored
to
life
8
6
and
when
the
king
asked
the
woman
she
told
him
so
the
king
appointed
unto
her
a
certain
officer
saying
restore
all
that
was
hers
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
field
since
the
day
that
she
left
the
land
even
until
now
8
7
and
elisha
came
to
damascus
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
was
sick
and
it
was
told
him
saying
the
man
of
god
is
come
hither
8
8
and
the
king
said
unto
hazael
take
a
present
in
thine
hand
and
go
meet
the
man
of
god
and
enquire
of
the
lord
by
him
saying
shall
i
recover
of
this
disease
8
9
so
hazael
went
to
meet
him
and
took
a
present
with
him
even
of
every
good
thing
of
damascus
forty
camels’
burden
and
came
and
stood
before
him
and
said
thy
son
benhadad
king
of
syria
hath
sent
me
to
thee
saying
shall
i
recover
of
this
disease
8
10
and
elisha
said
unto
him
go
say
unto
him
thou
mayest
certainly
recover
howbeit
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
that
he
shall
surely
die
8
11
and
he
settled
his
countenance
stedfastly
until
he
was
ashamed
and
the
man
of
god
wept
8
12
and
hazael
said
why
weepeth
my
lord
and
he
answered
because
i
know
the
evil
that
thou
wilt
do
unto
the
children
of
israel
their
strong
holds
wilt
thou
set
on
fire
and
their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay
with
the
sword
and
wilt
dash
their
children
and
rip
up
their
women
with
child
8
13
and
hazael
said
but
what
is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
great
thing
and
elisha
answered
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
that
thou
shalt
be
king
over
syria
8
14
so
he
departed
from
elisha
and
came
to
his
master
who
said
to
him
what
said
elisha
to
thee
and
he
answered
he
told
me
that
thou
shouldest
surely
recover
8
15
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
he
took
a
thick
cloth
and
dipped
it
in
water
and
spread
it
on
his
face
so
that
he
died
and
hazael
reigned
in
his
stead
8
16
and
in
the
fifth
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
jehoshaphat
being
then
king
of
judah
jehoram
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
began
to
reign
8
17
thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
jerusalem
8
18
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
the
daughter
of
ahab
was
his
wife
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
8
19
yet
the
lord
would
not
destroy
judah
for
david
his
servant’s
sake
as
he
promised
him
to
give
him
alway
a
light
and
to
his
children
8
20
in
his
days
edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
and
made
a
king
over
themselves
8
21
so
joram
went
over
to
zair
and
all
the
chariots
with
him
and
he
rose
by
night
and
smote
the
edomites
which
compassed
him
about
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots
and
the
people
fled
into
their
tents
8
22
yet
edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
unto
this
day
then
libnah
revolted
at
the
same
time
8
23
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
joram
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
8
24
and
joram
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
8
25
in
the
twelfth
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
did
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
begin
to
reign
8
26
two
and
twenty
years
old
was
ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
athaliah
the
daughter
of
omri
king
of
israel
8
27
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
the
house
of
ahab
8
28
and
he
went
with
joram
the
son
of
ahab
to
the
war
against
hazael
king
of
syria
in
ramothgilead
and
the
syrians
wounded
joram
8
29
and
king
joram
went
back
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
syrians
had
given
him
at
ramah
when
he
fought
against
hazael
king
of
syria
and
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
went
down
to
see
joram
the
son
of
ahab
in
jezreel
because
he
was
sick
9
1
and
elisha
the
prophet
called
one
of
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
said
unto
him
gird
up
thy
loins
and
take
this
box
of
oil
in
thine
hand
and
go
to
ramothgilead
9
2
and
when
thou
comest
thither
look
out
there
jehu
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
nimshi
and
go
in
and
make
him
arise
up
from
among
his
brethren
and
carry
him
to
an
inner
chamber
9
3
then
take
the
box
of
oil
and
pour
it
on
his
head
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
then
open
the
door
and
flee
and
tarry
not
9
4
so
the
young
man
even
the
young
man
the
prophet
went
to
ramothgilead
9
5
and
when
he
came
behold
the
captains
of
the
host
were
sitting
and
he
said
i
have
an
errand
to
thee
o
captain
and
jehu
said
unto
which
of
all
us
and
he
said
to
thee
o
captain
9
6
and
he
arose
and
went
into
the
house
and
he
poured
the
oil
on
his
head
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
the
people
of
the
lord
even
over
israel
9
7
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
house
of
ahab
thy
master
that
i
may
avenge
the
blood
of
my
servants
the
prophets
and
the
blood
of
all
the
servants
of
the
lord
at
the
hand
of
jezebel
9
8
for
the
whole
house
of
ahab
shall
perish
and
i
will
cut
off
from
ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
9
9
and
i
will
make
the
house
of
ahab
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
like
the
house
of
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
9
10
and
the
dogs
shall
eat
jezebel
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
and
there
shall
be
none
to
bury
her
and
he
opened
the
door
and
fled
9
11
then
jehu
came
forth
to
the
servants
of
his
lord
and
one
said
unto
him
is
all
well
wherefore
came
this
mad
fellow
to
thee
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
the
man
and
his
communication
9
12
and
they
said
it
is
false
tell
us
now
and
he
said
thus
and
thus
spake
he
to
me
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
9
13
then
they
hasted
and
took
every
man
his
garment
and
put
it
under
him
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
blew
with
trumpets
saying
jehu
is
king
9
14
so
jehu
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
nimshi
conspired
against
joram
(now
joram
had
kept
ramothgilead
he
and
all
israel
because
of
hazael
king
of
syria
9
15
but
king
joram
was
returned
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
syrians
had
given
him
when
he
fought
with
hazael
king
of
syria
)
and
jehu
said
if
it
be
your
minds
then
let
none
go
forth
nor
escape
out
of
the
city
to
go
to
tell
it
in
jezreel
9
16
so
jehu
rode
in
a
chariot
and
went
to
jezreel
for
joram
lay
there
and
ahaziah
king
of
judah
was
come
down
to
see
joram
9
17
and
there
stood
a
watchman
on
the
tower
in
jezreel
and
he
spied
the
company
of
jehu
as
he
came
and
said
i
see
a
company
and
joram
said
take
an
horseman
and
send
to
meet
them
and
let
him
say
is
it
peace
9
18
so
there
went
one
on
horseback
to
meet
him
and
said
thus
saith
the
king
is
it
peace
and
jehu
said
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
me
and
the
watchman
told
saying
the
messenger
came
to
them
but
he
cometh
not
again
9
19
then
he
sent
out
a
second
on
horseback
which
came
to
them
and
said
thus
saith
the
king
is
it
peace
and
jehu
answered
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
me
9
20
and
the
watchman
told
saying
he
came
even
unto
them
and
cometh
not
again
and
the
driving
is
like
the
driving
of
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
for
he
driveth
furiously
9
21
and
joram
said
make
ready
and
his
chariot
was
made
ready
and
joram
king
of
israel
and
ahaziah
king
of
judah
went
out
each
in
his
chariot
and
they
went
out
against
jehu
and
met
him
in
the
portion
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
9
22
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joram
saw
jehu
that
he
said
is
it
peace
jehu
and
he
answered
what
peace
so
long
as
the
whoredoms
of
thy
mother
jezebel
and
her
witchcrafts
are
so
many
9
23
and
joram
turned
his
hands
and
fled
and
said
to
ahaziah
there
is
treachery
o
ahaziah
9
24
and
jehu
drew
a
bow
with
his
full
strength
and
smote
jehoram
between
his
arms
and
the
arrow
went
out
at
his
heart
and
he
sunk
down
in
his
chariot
9
25
then
said
jehu
to
bidkar
his
captain
take
up
and
cast
him
in
the
portion
of
the
field
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
for
remember
how
that
when
i
and
thou
rode
together
after
ahab
his
father
the
lord
laid
this
burden
upon
him
9
26
surely
i
have
seen
yesterday
the
blood
of
naboth
and
the
blood
of
his
sons
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
requite
thee
in
this
plat
saith
the
lord
now
therefore
take
and
cast
him
into
the
plat
of
ground
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
9
27
but
when
ahaziah
the
king
of
judah
saw
this
he
fled
by
the
way
of
the
garden
house
and
jehu
followed
after
him
and
said
smite
him
also
in
the
chariot
and
they
did
so
at
the
going
up
to
gur
which
is
by
ibleam
and
he
fled
to
megiddo
and
died
there
9
28
and
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
to
jerusalem
and
buried
him
in
his
sepulchre
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
9
29
and
in
the
eleventh
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
began
ahaziah
to
reign
over
judah
9
30
and
when
jehu
was
come
to
jezreel
jezebel
heard
of
it
and
she
painted
her
face
and
tired
her
head
and
looked
out
at
a
window
9
31
and
as
jehu
entered
in
at
the
gate
she
said
had
zimri
peace
who
slew
his
master
9
32
and
he
lifted
up
his
face
to
the
window
and
said
who
is
on
my
side
who
and
there
looked
out
to
him
two
or
three
eunuchs
9
33
and
he
said
throw
her
down
so
they
threw
her
down
and
some
of
her
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
wall
and
on
the
horses
and
he
trode
her
under
foot
9
34
and
when
he
was
come
in
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
said
go
see
now
this
cursed
woman
and
bury
her
for
she
is
a
king’s
daughter
9
35
and
they
went
to
bury
her
but
they
found
no
more
of
her
than
the
skull
and
the
feet
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
9
36
wherefore
they
came
again
and
told
him
and
he
said
this
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
shall
dogs
eat
the
flesh
of
jezebel
9
37
and
the
carcase
of
jezebel
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
field
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
so
that
they
shall
not
say
this
is
jezebel
10
1
and
ahab
had
seventy
sons
in
samaria
and
jehu
wrote
letters
and
sent
to
samaria
unto
the
rulers
of
jezreel
to
the
elders
and
to
them
that
brought
up
ahab’s
children
saying
10
2
now
as
soon
as
this
letter
cometh
to
you
seeing
your
master’s
sons
are
with
you
and
there
are
with
you
chariots
and
horses
a
fenced
city
also
and
armour
10
3
look
even
out
the
best
and
meetest
of
your
master’s
sons
and
set
him
on
his
father’s
throne
and
fight
for
your
master’s
house
10
4
but
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
behold
two
kings
stood
not
before
him
how
then
shall
we
stand
10
5
and
he
that
was
over
the
house
and
he
that
was
over
the
city
the
elders
also
and
the
bringers
up
of
the
children
sent
to
jehu
saying
we
are
thy
servants
and
will
do
all
that
thou
shalt
bid
us
we
will
not
make
any
king
do
thou
that
which
is
good
in
thine
eyes
10
6
then
he
wrote
a
letter
the
second
time
to
them
saying
if
ye
be
mine
and
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
my
voice
take
ye
the
heads
of
the
men
your
master’s
sons
and
come
to
me
to
jezreel
by
to
morrow
this
time
now
the
king’s
sons
being
seventy
persons
were
with
the
great
men
of
the
city
which
brought
them
up
10
7
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
letter
came
to
them
that
they
took
the
king’s
sons
and
slew
seventy
persons
and
put
their
heads
in
baskets
and
sent
him
them
to
jezreel
10
8
and
there
came
a
messenger
and
told
him
saying
they
have
brought
the
heads
of
the
king’s
sons
and
he
said
lay
ye
them
in
two
heaps
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
until
the
morning
10
9
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
he
went
out
and
stood
and
said
to
all
the
people
ye
be
righteous
behold
i
conspired
against
my
master
and
slew
him
but
who
slew
all
these
10
10
know
now
that
there
shall
fall
unto
the
earth
nothing
of
the
word
of
the
lord
which
the
lord
spake
concerning
the
house
of
ahab
for
the
lord
hath
done
that
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
elijah
10
11
so
jehu
slew
all
that
remained
of
the
house
of
ahab
in
jezreel
and
all
his
great
men
and
his
kinsfolks
and
his
priests
until
he
left
him
none
remaining
10
12
and
he
arose
and
departed
and
came
to
samaria
and
as
he
was
at
the
shearing
house
in
the
way
10
13
jehu
met
with
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
king
of
judah
and
said
who
are
ye
and
they
answered
we
are
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
and
we
go
down
to
salute
the
children
of
the
king
and
the
children
of
the
queen
10
14
and
he
said
take
them
alive
and
they
took
them
alive
and
slew
them
at
the
pit
of
the
shearing
house
even
two
and
forty
men
neither
left
he
any
of
them
10
15
and
when
he
was
departed
thence
he
lighted
on
jehonadab
the
son
of
rechab
coming
to
meet
him
and
he
saluted
him
and
said
to
him
is
thine
heart
right
as
my
heart
is
with
thy
heart
and
jehonadab
answered
it
is
if
it
be
give
me
thine
hand
and
he
gave
him
his
hand
and
he
took
him
up
to
him
into
the
chariot
10
16
and
he
said
come
with
me
and
see
my
zeal
for
the
lord
so
they
made
him
ride
in
his
chariot
10
17
and
when
he
came
to
samaria
he
slew
all
that
remained
unto
ahab
in
samaria
till
he
had
destroyed
him
according
to
the
saying
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
to
elijah
10
18
and
jehu
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
said
unto
them
ahab
served
baal
a
little
but
jehu
shall
serve
him
much
10
19
now
therefore
call
unto
me
all
the
prophets
of
baal
all
his
servants
and
all
his
priests
let
none
be
wanting
for
i
have
a
great
sacrifice
to
do
to
baal
whosoever
shall
be
wanting
he
shall
not
live
but
jehu
did
it
in
subtilty
to
the
intent
that
he
might
destroy
the
worshippers
of
baal
10
20
and
jehu
said
proclaim
a
solemn
assembly
for
baal
and
they
proclaimed
it
10
21
and
jehu
sent
through
all
israel
and
all
the
worshippers
of
baal
came
so
that
there
was
not
a
man
left
that
came
not
and
they
came
into
the
house
of
baal
and
the
house
of
baal
was
full
from
one
end
to
another
10
22
and
he
said
unto
him
that
was
over
the
vestry
bring
forth
vestments
for
all
the
worshippers
of
baal
and
he
brought
them
forth
vestments
10
23
and
jehu
went
and
jehonadab
the
son
of
rechab
into
the
house
of
baal
and
said
unto
the
worshippers
of
baal
search
and
look
that
there
be
here
with
you
none
of
the
servants
of
the
lord
but
the
worshippers
of
baal
only
10
24
and
when
they
went
in
to
offer
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
jehu
appointed
fourscore
men
without
and
said
if
any
of
the
men
whom
i
have
brought
into
your
hands
escape
he
that
letteth
him
go
his
life
shall
be
for
the
life
of
him
10
25
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering
that
jehu
said
to
the
guard
and
to
the
captains
go
in
and
slay
them
let
none
come
forth
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
guard
and
the
captains
cast
them
out
and
went
to
the
city
of
the
house
of
baal
10
26
and
they
brought
forth
the
images
out
of
the
house
of
baal
and
burned
them
10
27
and
they
brake
down
the
image
of
baal
and
brake
down
the
house
of
baal
and
made
it
a
draught
house
unto
this
day
10
28
thus
jehu
destroyed
baal
out
of
israel
10
29
howbeit
from
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
jehu
departed
not
from
after
them
to
wit
the
golden
calves
that
were
in
bethel
and
that
were
in
dan
10
30
and
the
lord
said
unto
jehu
because
thou
hast
done
well
in
executing
that
which
is
right
in
mine
eyes
and
hast
done
unto
the
house
of
ahab
according
to
all
that
was
in
mine
heart
thy
children
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
10
31
but
jehu
took
no
heed
to
walk
in
the
law
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
with
all
his
heart
for
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
made
israel
to
sin
10
32
in
those
days
the
lord
began
to
cut
israel
short
and
hazael
smote
them
in
all
the
coasts
of
israel
10
33
from
jordan
eastward
all
the
land
of
gilead
the
gadites
and
the
reubenites
and
the
manassites
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
river
arnon
even
gilead
and
bashan
10
34
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehu
and
all
that
he
did
and
all
his
might
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
10
35
and
jehu
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
samaria
and
jehoahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
10
36
and
the
time
that
jehu
reigned
over
israel
in
samaria
was
twenty
and
eight
years
11
1
and
when
athaliah
the
mother
of
ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
11
2
but
jehosheba
the
daughter
of
king
joram
sister
of
ahaziah
took
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king’s
sons
which
were
slain
and
they
hid
him
even
him
and
his
nurse
in
the
bedchamber
from
athaliah
so
that
he
was
not
slain
11
3
and
he
was
with
her
hid
in
the
house
of
the
lord
six
years
and
athaliah
did
reign
over
the
land
11
4
and
the
seventh
year
jehoiada
sent
and
fetched
the
rulers
over
hundreds
with
the
captains
and
the
guard
and
brought
them
to
him
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
made
a
covenant
with
them
and
took
an
oath
of
them
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
shewed
them
the
king’s
son
11
5
and
he
commanded
them
saying
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
a
third
part
of
you
that
enter
in
on
the
sabbath
shall
even
be
keepers
of
the
watch
of
the
king’s
house
11
6
and
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
gate
of
sur
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
behind
the
guard
so
shall
ye
keep
the
watch
of
the
house
that
it
be
not
broken
down
11
7
and
two
parts
of
all
you
that
go
forth
on
the
sabbath
even
they
shall
keep

and
ye
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
he
that
cometh
within
the
ranges
let
him
be
slain
and
be
ye
with
the
king
as
he
goeth
out
and
as
he
cometh
in
11
9
and
the
captains
over
the
hundreds
did
according
to
all
things
that
jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
and
they
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath
with
them
that
should
go
out
on
the
sabbath
and
came
to
jehoiada
the
priest
11
10
and
to
the
captains
over
hundreds
did
the
priest
give
king
david’s
spears
and
shields
that
were
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
11
11
and
the
guard
stood
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
round
about
the
king
from
the
right
corner
of
the
temple
to
the
left
corner
of
the
temple
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple
11
12
and
he
brought
forth
the
king’s
son
and
put
the
crown
upon
him
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
they
made
him
king
and
anointed
him
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
said
god
save
the
king
11
13
and
when
athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
guard
and
of
the
people
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
11
14
and
when
she
looked
behold
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar
as
the
manner
was
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpeters
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
blew
with
trumpets
and
athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
cried
treason
treason
11
15
but
jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
captains
of
the
hundreds
the
officers
of
the
host
and
said
unto
them
have
her
forth
without
the
ranges
and
him
that
followeth
her
kill
with
the
sword
for
the
priest
had
said
let
her
not
be
slain
in
the
house
of
the
lord
11
16
and
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
she
went
by
the
way
by
the
which
the
horses
came
into
the
king’s
house
and
there
was
she
slain
11
17
and
jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
the
lord
and
the
king
and
the
people
that
they
should
be
the
lord’s
people
between
the
king
also
and
the
people
11
18
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
went
into
the
house
of
baal
and
brake
it
down
his
altars
and
his
images
brake
they
in
pieces
thoroughly
and
slew
mattan
the
priest
of
baal
before
the
altars
and
the
priest
appointed
officers
over
the
house
of
the
lord
11
19
and
he
took
the
rulers
over
hundreds
and
the
captains
and
the
guard
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
they
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
came
by
the
way
of
the
gate
of
the
guard
to
the
king’s
house
and
he
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
kings
11
20
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
in
quiet
and
they
slew
athaliah
with
the
sword
beside
the
king’s
house
11
21
seven
years
old
was
jehoash
when
he
began
to
reign
12
1
in
the
seventh
year
of
jehu
jehoash
began
to
reign
and
forty
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
zibiah
of
beersheba
12
2
and
jehoash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
his
days
wherein
jehoiada
the
priest
instructed
him
12
3
but
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
the
people
still
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places
12
4
and
jehoash
said
to
the
priests
all
the
money
of
the
dedicated
things
that
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
even
the
money
of
every
one
that
passeth
the
account
the
money
that
every
man
is
set
at
and
all
the
money
that
cometh
into
any
man’s
heart
to
bring
into
the
house
of
the
lord
12
5
let
the
priests
take
it
to
them
every
man
of
his
acquaintance
and
let
them
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
wheresoever
any
breach
shall
be
found
12
6
but
it
was
so
that
in
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
king
jehoash
the
priests
had
not
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
house
12
7
then
king
jehoash
called
for
jehoiada
the
priest
and
the
other
priests
and
said
unto
them
why
repair
ye
not
the
breaches
of
the
house
now
therefore
receive
no
more
money
of
your
acquaintance
but
deliver
it
for
the
breaches
of
the
house
12
8
and
the
priests
consented
to
receive
no
more
money
of
the
people
neither
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
12
9
but
jehoiada
the
priest
took
a
chest
and
bored
a
hole
in
the
lid
of
it
and
set
it
beside
the
altar
on
the
right
side
as
one
cometh
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
priests
that
kept
the
door
put
therein
all
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
12
10
and
it
was
so
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
in
the
chest
that
the
king’s
scribe
and
the
high
priest
came
up
and
they
put
up
in
bags
and
told
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
12
11
and
they
gave
the
money
being
told
into
the
hands
of
them
that
did
the
work
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
laid
it
out
to
the
carpenters
and
builders
that
wrought
upon
the
house
of
the
lord
12
12
and
to
masons
and
hewers
of
stone
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewed
stone
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
for
all
that
was
laid
out
for
the
house
to
repair
it
12
13
howbeit
there
were
not
made
for
the
house
of
the
lord
bowls
of
silver
snuffers
basons
trumpets
any
vessels
of
gold
or
vessels
of
silver
of
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
12
14
but
they
gave
that
to
the
workmen
and
repaired
therewith
the
house
of
the
lord
12
15
moreover
they
reckoned
not
with
the
men
into
whose
hand
they
delivered
the
money
to
be
bestowed
on
workmen
for
they
dealt
faithfully
12
16
the
trespass
money
and
sin
money
was
not
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
it
was
the
priests’
12
17
then
hazael
king
of
syria
went
up
and
fought
against
gath
and
took
it
and
hazael
set
his
face
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
12
18
and
jehoash
king
of
judah
took
all
the
hallowed
things
that
jehoshaphat
and
jehoram
and
ahaziah
his
fathers
kings
of
judah
had
dedicated
and
his
own
hallowed
things
and
all
the
gold
that
was
found
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
king’s
house
and
sent
it
to
hazael
king
of
syria
and
he
went
away
from
jerusalem
12
19
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
joash
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
12
20
and
his
servants
arose
and
made
a
conspiracy
and
slew
joash
in
the
house
of
millo
which
goeth
down
to
silla
12
21
for
jozachar
the
son
of
shimeath
and
jehozabad
the
son
of
shomer
his
servants
smote
him
and
he
died
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
13
1
in
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
king
of
judah
jehoahaz
the
son
of
jehu
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
and
reigned
seventeen
years
13
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
followed
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
which
made
israel
to
sin
he
departed
not
therefrom
13
3
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
hazael
king
of
syria
and
into
the
hand
of
benhadad
the
son
of
hazael
all
their
days
13
4
and
jehoahaz
besought
the
lord
and
the
lord
hearkened
unto
him
for
he
saw
the
oppression
of
israel
because
the
king
of
syria
oppressed
them
13
5
(and
the
lord
gave
israel
a
saviour
so
that
they
went
out
from
under
the
hand
of
the
syrians
and
the
children
of
israel
dwelt
in
their
tents
as
beforetime
13
6
nevertheless
they
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
the
house
of
jeroboam
who
made
israel
sin
but
walked
therein
and
there
remained
the
grove
also
in
samaria
)
13
7
neither
did
he
leave
of
the
people
to
jehoahaz
but
fifty
horsemen
and
ten
chariots
and
ten
thousand
footmen
for
the
king
of
syria
had
destroyed
them
and
had
made
them
like
the
dust
by
threshing
13
8
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoahaz
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
might
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
13
9
and
jehoahaz
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
samaria
and
joash
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
13
10
in
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
joash
king
of
judah
began
jehoash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
and
reigned
sixteen
years
13
11
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
he
departed
not
from
all
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
sin
but
he
walked
therein
13
12
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
joash
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
might
wherewith
he
fought
against
amaziah
king
of
judah
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
13
13
and
joash
slept
with
his
fathers
and
jeroboam
sat
upon
his
throne
and
joash
was
buried
in
samaria
with
the
kings
of
israel
13
14
now
elisha
was
fallen
sick
of
his
sickness
whereof
he
died
and
joash
the
king
of
israel
came
down
unto
him
and
wept
over
his
face
and
said
o
my
father
my
father
the
chariot
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
13
15
and
elisha
said
unto
him
take
bow
and
arrows
and
he
took
unto
him
bow
and
arrows
13
16
and
he
said
to
the
king
of
israel
put
thine
hand
upon
the
bow
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
it
and
elisha
put
his
hands
upon
the
king’s
hands
13
17
and
he
said
open
the
window
eastward
and
he
opened
it
then
elisha
said
shoot
and
he
shot
and
he
said
the
arrow
of
the
lord’s
deliverance
and
the
arrow
of
deliverance
from
syria
for
thou
shalt
smite
the
syrians
in
aphek
till
thou
have
consumed
them
13
18
and
he
said
take
the
arrows
and
he
took
them
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
smite
upon
the
ground
and
he
smote
thrice
and
stayed
13
19
and
the
man
of
god
was
wroth
with
him
and
said
thou
shouldest
have
smitten
five
or
six
times
then
hadst
thou
smitten
syria
till
thou
hadst
consumed
it
whereas
now
thou
shalt
smite
syria
but
thrice
13
20
and
elisha
died
and
they
buried
him
and
the
bands
of
the
moabites
invaded
the
land
at
the
coming
in
of
the
year
13
21
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
were
burying
a
man
that
behold
they
spied
a
band
of
men
and
they
cast
the
man
into
the
sepulchre
of
elisha
and
when
the
man
was
let
down
and
touched
the
bones
of
elisha
he
revived
and
stood
up
on
his
feet
13
22
but
hazael
king
of
syria
oppressed
israel
all
the
days
of
jehoahaz
13
23
and
the
lord
was
gracious
unto
them
and
had
compassion
on
them
and
had
respect
unto
them
because
of
his
covenant
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
would
not
destroy
them
neither
cast
he
them
from
his
presence
as
yet
13
24
so
hazael
king
of
syria
died
and
benhadad
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
13
25
and
jehoash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
took
again
out
of
the
hand
of
benhadad
the
son
of
hazael
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
out
of
the
hand
of
jehoahaz
his
father
by
war
three
times
did
joash
beat
him
and
recovered
the
cities
of
israel
14
1
in
the
second
year
of
joash
son
of
jehoahaz
king
of
israel
reigned
amaziah
the
son
of
joash
king
of
judah
14
2
he
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
jehoaddan
of
jerusalem
14
3
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yet
not
like
david
his
father
he
did
according
to
all
things
as
joash
his
father
did
14
4
howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
as
yet
the
people
did
sacrifice
and
burnt
incense
on
the
high
places
14
5
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
the
kingdom
was
confirmed
in
his
hand
that
he
slew
his
servants
which
had
slain
the
king
his
father
14
6
but
the
children
of
the
murderers
he
slew
not
according
unto
that
which
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
wherein
the
lord
commanded
saying
the
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children
nor
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers
but
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin
14
7
he
slew
of
edom
in
the
valley
of
salt
ten
thousand
and
took
selah
by
war
and
called
the
name
of
it
joktheel
unto
this
day
14
8
then
amaziah
sent
messengers
to
jehoash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
son
of
jehu
king
of
israel
saying
come
let
us
look
one
another
in
the
face
14
9
and
jehoash
the
king
of
israel
sent
to
amaziah
king
of
judah
saying
the
thistle
that
was
in
lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
lebanon
saying
give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
lebanon
and
trode
down
the
thistle
14
10
thou
hast
indeed
smitten
edom
and
thine
heart
hath
lifted
thee
up
glory
of
this
and
tarry
at
home
for
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thy
hurt
that
thou
shouldest
fall
even
thou
and
judah
with
thee
14
11
but
amaziah
would
not
hear
therefore
jehoash
king
of
israel
went
up
and
he
and
amaziah
king
of
judah
looked
one
another
in
the
face
at
bethshemesh
which
belongeth
to
judah
14
12
and
judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
and
they
fled
every
man
to
their
tents
14
13
and
jehoash
king
of
israel
took
amaziah
king
of
judah
the
son
of
jehoash
the
son
of
ahaziah
at
bethshemesh
and
came
to
jerusalem
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
ephraim
unto
the
corner
gate
four
hundred
cubits
14
14
and
he
took
all
the
gold
and
silver
and
all

buried
in

with
the

and
jeroboam
his
son
reigned

lived
after

son
of

and
the

are
they
not
written
in

now
they
made

and
he
fled

but
they
sent
after
him
to
lachish
and
slew

there
14

and
they
brought
him
on
horses
and
he
was
buried
at
jerusalem
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
14
21
and
all
the
people
of
judah
took
azariah
which
was
sixteen
years
old
and
made
him
king
instead
of
his
father
amaziah
14
22
he
built
elath
and
restored
it
to

after
that
the
king
slept
with

14
23
in

the

jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of

began
to
reign
in

and
reigned
forty
and
one
years
14
24
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
he
departed
not
from
all
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
14
25
he
restored
the
coast
of
israel
from
the
entering
of
hamath
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
his
servant
jonah
the
son
of
amittai
the
prophet
which
was
of
gathhepher
14
26
for
the
lord
saw
the
affliction
of
israel
that
it
was
very
bitter
for
there
was
not
any
shut
up
nor
any
left
nor
any
helper
for
israel
14
27
and
the
lord
said
not
that
he
would
blot
out
the
name
of
israel
from
under
heaven
but
he
saved
them
by
the
hand
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
14
28
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jeroboam
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
might
how
he
warred
and
how
he
recovered
damascus
and
hamath
which
belonged
to
judah
for
israel
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
14
29
and
jeroboam
slept
with
his
fathers
even
with
the
kings
of
israel
and
zachariah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
15

in

king
of

began
azariah
son

sixteen
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
two
and
fifty
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
jecholiah

15

and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
father
amaziah
had
done
15
4
save
that
the
high
places
were
not
removed
the
people
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
still
on
the
high
places
15
5
and
the
lord
smote
the
king
so
that
he
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
death
and
dwelt
in
a
several
house
and
jotham
the
king’s
son
was
over
the
house
judging
the
people
of
the
land
15

and
the
rest
of
the
acts

and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the

15

so

slept
with
his

and
they
buried
him
with
his

his

he
departed
not
from

the

conspired
against
him
and
smote
him
before
the
people
and
slew
him
and
reigned
in

15
11
and

zachariah
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of

15
12
this
was
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
jehu
saying
thy
sons
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
unto

so
it

smote
tiphsah
and
all
that

and
the
coasts
thereof
from

19
and
pul
the

came
against

menahem
gave

talents
of
silver
that
his

11
and
urijah
the

offering
and
poured
his

offering
and
sprinkled
the

and
put

16
15
and

the

16
16
thus
did
urijah
the

according
to
all
that
king
ahaz
commanded
16
17
and
king

cut
off
the

hoshea
became
his
servant
and
gave
him

and
the

so
king
of
egypt
and
brought
no
present

therefore
the

gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
medes
17
7
for
so
it
was
that
the
children
of
israel
had
sinned
against
the
lord
their
god
which
had
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
under
the
hand
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
had
feared
other
gods
17
8
and
walked
in
the
statutes
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
cast
out
from
before
the
children
of
israel
and
of
the
kings
of
israel
which
they
had
made
17
9
and
the
children
of
israel
did
secretly
those
things
that
were
not
right
against
the
lord
their
god
and
they
built
them
high
places
in
all
their
cities
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city
17
10
and
they
set
them
up
images
and
groves
in
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
17
11
and
there
they
burnt
incense
in
all
the
high
places
as
did
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
carried
away
before
them
and
wrought
wicked
things
to
provoke
the
lord
to
anger
17
12
for
they
served
idols
whereof
the
lord
had
said
unto
them
ye
shall
not
do
this
thing
17
13
yet
the
lord
testified
against
israel
and
against
judah
by
all
the
prophets
and
by
all
the
seers
saying
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways
and
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
according
to
all
the
law
which
i
commanded
your
fathers
and
which
i
sent
to
you
by
my
servants
the
prophets
17
14
notwithstanding
they
would
not
hear
but
hardened
their
necks
like
to
the
neck
of
their
fathers
that
did
not
believe
in
the
lord
their
god
17
15
and
they
rejected
his
statutes
and
his
covenant
that
he
made
with
their
fathers
and
his
testimonies
which
he
testified
against
them
and
they
followed
vanity
and
became
vain
and
went
after
the
heathen
that
were
round
about
them
concerning
whom
the
lord
had
charged
them
that
they
should
not
do
like
them
17
16
and
they
left
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
their
god
and
made
them
molten
images
even
two
calves
and
made
a
grove
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
baal
17
17
and
they
caused
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
and
used
divination
and
enchantments
and
sold
themselves
to
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
17
18
therefore
the
lord
was
very
angry
with
israel
and
removed
them
out
of
his
sight
there
was
none
left
but
the
tribe
of
judah
only
17
19
also
judah
kept
not
the
commandments
of
the
lord
their
god
but
walked
in
the
statutes
of
israel
which
they
made
17
20
and
the
lord
rejected
all
the
seed
of
israel
and
afflicted
them
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
spoilers
until
he
had
cast
them
out
of
his
sight
17
21
for
he
rent
israel
from
the
house
of
david
and
they
made
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
king
and
jeroboam
drave
israel
from
following
the
lord
and
made
them
sin
a
great
sin
17
22
for
the
children
of
israel
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
he
did
they
departed
not
from
them
17
23
until
the
lord
removed
israel
out
of
his
sight
as
he
had
said
by
all
his
servants
the
prophets
so
was
israel
carried
away
out
of
their
own
land
to
assyria
unto
this
day
17
24
and
the
king
of
assyria
brought
men
from
babylon
and
from
cuthah
and
from
ava
and
from
hamath
and
from
sepharvaim
and
placed
them
in
the
cities
of
samaria
instead
of
the
children
of
israel
and
they
possessed
samaria
and
dwelt
in
the
cities
thereof
17
25
and
so
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
their
dwelling
there
that
they
feared
not
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
sent
lions
among
them
which
slew
some
of
them
17
26
wherefore
they
spake
to
the
king
of
assyria
saying
the
nations
which
thou
hast
removed
and
placed
in
the
cities
of
samaria
know
not
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
therefore
he
hath
sent
lions
among
them
and
behold
they
slay
them
because
they
know
not
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
17
27
then
the
king
of
assyria
commanded
saying
carry
thither
one
of
the
priests
whom
ye
brought
from
thence
and
let
them
go
and
dwell
there
and
let
him
teach
them
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
17
28
then
one
of
the
priests
whom
they
had
carried
away
from
samaria
came
and
dwelt
in
bethel
and
taught
them
how
they
should
fear
the
lord
17
29
howbeit
every
nation
made
gods
of
their
own
and
put
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
the
samaritans
had
made
every
nation
in
their
cities
wherein
they
dwelt
17
30
and
the
men
of
babylon
made
succothbenoth
and
the
men
of
cuth
made
nergal
and
the
men
of
hamath
made
ashima
17
31
and
the
avites
made
nibhaz
and
tartak
and
the
sepharvites
burnt
their
children
in
fire
to
adrammelech
and
anammelech
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
17
32
so
they
feared
the
lord
and
made
unto
themselves
of
the
lowest
of
them
priests
of
the
high
places
which
sacrificed
for
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places
17
33
they
feared
the
lord
and
served
their
own
gods
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
whom
they
carried
away
from
thence
17
34
unto
this
day
they
do
after
the
former
manners
they
fear
not
the
lord
neither
do
they
after
their
statutes
or
after
their
ordinances
or
after
the
law
and
commandment
which
the
lord
commanded
the
children
of
jacob
whom
he
named
israel
17
35
with
whom
the
lord
had
made
a
covenant
and
charged
them
saying
ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods
nor
bow
yourselves
to
them
nor
serve
them
nor
sacrifice
to
them
17
36
but
the
lord
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
great
power
and
a
stretched
out
arm
him
shall
ye
fear
and
him
shall
ye
worship
and
to
him
shall
ye
do
sacrifice
17
37
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
and
the
law
and
the
commandment
which
he
wrote
for
you
ye
shall
observe
to
do
for
evermore
and
ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods
17
38
and
the
covenant
that
i
have
made
with
you
ye
shall
not
forget
neither
shall
ye
fear
other
gods
17
39
but
the
lord
your
god
ye
shall
fear
and
he
shall
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
all
your
enemies
17
40
howbeit
they
did
not
hearken
but
they
did
after
their
former
manner
17
41
so
these
nations
feared
the
lord
and
served
their
graven
images
both
their
children
and
their
children’s
children
as
did
their
fathers
so
do
they
unto
this
day
18
1
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year
of
hoshea
son
of
elah
king
of
israel
that
hezekiah
the
son
of
ahaz
king
of
judah
began
to
reign
18
2
twenty
and
five
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
abi
the
daughter
of
zachariah
18
3
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
david
his
father
did
18
4
he
removed
the
high
places
and
brake
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
brake
in
pieces
the
brasen
serpent
that
moses
had
made
for
unto
those
days
the
children
of
israel
did
burn
incense
to
it
and
he
called
it
nehushtan
18
5
he
trusted
in
the
lord
god
of
israel
so
that
after
him
was
none
like
him
among
all
the
kings
of
judah
nor
any
that
were
before
him
18
6
for
he
clave
to
the
lord
and
departed
not
from
following
him
but
kept
his
commandments
which
the
lord
commanded
moses
18
7
and
the
lord
was
with
him
and
he
prospered
whithersoever
he
went
forth
and
he
rebelled
against
the
king
of
assyria
and
served
him
not
18
8
he
smote
the
philistines
even
unto
gaza
and
the
borders
thereof
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city
18
9
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
hezekiah
which
was
the
seventh
year
of
hoshea
son
of
elah
king
of
israel
that
shalmaneser
king
of
assyria
came
up
against
samaria
and
besieged
it
18
10
and
at
the
end
of
three
years
they
took
it
even
in
the
sixth
year
of
hezekiah
that
is
in
the
ninth
year
of
hoshea
king
of
israel
samaria
was
taken
18
11
and
the
king
of
assyria
did
carry
away
israel
unto
assyria
and
put
them
in
halah
and
in
habor
by
the
river
of
gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
medes
18
12
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
but
transgressed
his
covenant
and
all
that
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
and
would
not
hear
them
nor
do
them
18
13
now
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
hezekiah
did
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
come
up
against
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
and
took
them
18
14
and
hezekiah
king
of
judah
sent
to
the
king
of
assyria
to
lachish
saying
i
have
offended
return
from
me
that
which
thou
puttest
on
me
will
i
bear
and
the
king
of
assyria
appointed
unto
hezekiah
king
of
judah
three
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
thirty
talents
of
gold
18
15
and
hezekiah
gave
him
all
the
silver
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king’s
house
18
16
at
that
time
did
hezekiah
cut
off
the
gold
from
the
doors
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
from
the
pillars
which
hezekiah
king
of
judah
had
overlaid
and
gave
it
to
the
king
of
assyria
18
17
and
the
king
of
assyria
sent
tartan
and
rabsaris
and
rabshakeh
from
lachish
to
king
hezekiah
with
a
great
host
against
jerusalem
and
they
went
up
and
came
to
jerusalem
and
when
they
were
come
up
they
came
and
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
which
is
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller’s
field
18
18
and
when
they
had
called
to
the
king
there
came
out
to
them
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
18
19
and
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
speak
ye
now
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
what
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest
18
20
thou
sayest
(but
they
are
but
vain
words
)
i
have
counsel
and
strength
for
the
war
now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
rebellest
against
me
18
21
now
behold
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
of
this
bruised
reed
even
upon
egypt
on
which
if
a
man
lean
it
will
go
into
his
hand
and
pierce
it
so
is
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
unto
all
that
trust
on
him
18
22
but
if
ye
say
unto
me
we
trust
in
the
lord
our
god
is
not
that
he
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
hezekiah
hath
taken
away
and
hath
said
to
judah
and
jerusalem
ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar
in
jerusalem
18
23
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
give
pledges
to
my
lord
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
deliver
thee
two
thousand
horses
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them
18
24
how
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master’s
servants
and
put
thy
trust
on
egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
18
25
am
i
now
come
up
without
the
lord
against
this
place
to
destroy
it
the
lord
said
to
me
go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
18
26
then
said
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
and
shebna
and
joah
unto
rabshakeh
speak
i
pray
thee
to
thy
servants
in
the
syrian
language
for
we
understand
it
and
talk
not
with
us
in
the
jews’
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall
18
27
but
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master
and
to
thee
to
speak
these
words
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
which
sit
on
the
wall
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you
18
28
then
rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews’
language
and
spake
saying
hear
the
word
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
18
29
thus
saith
the
king
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
his
hand
18
30
neither
let
hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
lord
saying
the
lord
will
surely
deliver
us
and
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
18
31
hearken
not
to
hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
assyria
make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present
and
come
out
to
me
and
then
eat
ye
every
man
of
his
own
vine
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
cistern
18
32
until
i
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
a
land
of
oil
olive
and
of
honey
that
ye
may
live
and
not
die
and
hearken
not
unto
hezekiah
when
he
persuadeth
you
saying
the
lord
will
deliver
us
18
33
hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
at
all
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
18
34
where
are
the
gods
of
hamath
and
of
arpad
where
are
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
hena
and
ivah
have
they
delivered
samaria
out
of
mine
hand
18
35
who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
the
countries
that
have
delivered
their
country
out
of
mine
hand
that
the
lord
should
deliver
jerusalem
out
of
mine
hand
18
36
but
the
people
held
their
peace
and
answered
him
not
a
word
for
the
king’s
commandment
was
saying
answer
him
not
18
37
then
came
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
to
hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent
and
told
him
the
words
of
rabshakeh
19
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
hezekiah
heard
it
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
19
2
and
he
sent
eliakim
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
to
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
19
3
and
they
said
unto
him
thus
saith
hezekiah
this
day
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
rebuke
and
blasphemy
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth

it
may
be
the
lord
thy
god
will
hear
all
the
words
of
rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
and
will
reprove
the
words
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
heard
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
are
left
19
5
so
the
servants
of
king
hezekiah
came
to
isaiah
19
6
and
isaiah
said
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
to
your
master
thus
saith
the
lord
be
not
afraid
of
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
with
which
the
servants
of
the
king
of
assyria
have
blasphemed
me
19
7
behold
i
will
send
a
blast
upon
him
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour
and
shall
return
to
his
own
land
and
i
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
19
8
so
rabshakeh
returned
and
found
the
king
of
assyria
warring
against
libnah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
lachish
19
9
and
when
he
heard
say
of
tirhakah
king
of
ethiopia
behold
he
is
come
out
to
fight
against
thee
he
sent
messengers
again
unto
hezekiah
saying
19
10
thus
shall
ye
speak
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
saying
let
not
thy
god
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
jerusalem
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
19
11
behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered
19
12
have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed
as
gozan
and
haran
and
rezeph
and
the
children
of
eden
which
were
in
thelasar
19
13
where
is
the
king
of
hamath
and
the
king
of
arpad
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
sepharvaim
of
hena
and
ivah
19
14
and
hezekiah
received
the
letter
of
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
it
and
hezekiah
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
spread
it
before
the
lord
19
15
and
hezekiah
prayed
before
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
which
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
thou
art
the
god
even
thou
alone
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
19
16
lord
bow
down
thine
ear
and
hear
open
lord
thine
eyes
and
see
and
hear
the
words
of
sennacherib
which
hath
sent
him
to
reproach
the
living
god
19
17
of
a
truth
lord
the
kings
of
assyria
have
destroyed
the
nations
and
their
lands
19
18
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
no
gods
but
the
work
of
men’s
hands
wood
and
stone
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
19
19
now
therefore
o
lord
our
god
i
beseech
thee
save
thou
us
out
of
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
god
even
thou
only
19
20
then
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
sent
to
hezekiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
that
which
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
i
have
heard
19
21
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
him
the
virgin
the
daughter
of
zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee
19
22
whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high
even
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
19
23
by
thy
messengers
thou
hast
reproached
the
lord
and
hast
said
with
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
i
am
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains
to
the
sides
of
lebanon
and
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedar
trees
thereof
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof
and
i
will
enter
into
the
lodgings
of
his
borders
and
into
the
forest
of
his
carmel
19
24
i
have
digged
and
drunk
strange
waters
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
i
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
besieged
places
19
25
hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago
how
i
have
done
it
and
of
ancient
times
that
i
have
formed
it
now
have
i
brought
it
to
pass
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
fenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps
19
26
therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field
and
as
the
green
herb
as
the
grass
on
the
house
tops
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up
19
27
but
i
know
thy
abode
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
thy
rage
against
me
19
28
because
thy
rage
against
me
and
thy
tumult
is
come
up
into
mine
ears
therefore
i
will
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest
19
29
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
things
as
grow
of
themselves
and
in
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye
and
reap
and
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruits
thereof
19
30
and
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
judah
shall
yet
again
take
root
downward
and
bear
fruit
upward
19
31
for
out
of
jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
zion
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
do
this
19
32
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
king
of
assyria
he
shall
not
come
into
this
city
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there
nor
come
before
it
with
shield
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it
19
33
by
the
way
that
he
came
by
the
same
shall
he
return
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city
saith
the
lord
19
34
for
i
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david’s
sake
19
35
and
it
came
to
pass
that
night
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
out
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
an
hundred
fourscore
and
five
thousand
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
they
were
all
dead
corpses
19
36
so
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
departed
and
went
and
returned
and
dwelt
at
nineveh
19
37
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
nisroch
his
god
that
adrammelech
and
sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
armenia
and
esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
20
1
in
those
days
was
hezekiah
sick
unto
death
and
the
prophet
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
set
thine
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
live
20
2
then
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
20
3
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
remember
now
how
i
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight
and
hezekiah
wept
sore
20
4
and
it
came
to
pass
afore
isaiah
was
gone
out
into
the
middle
court
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
him
saying
20
5
turn
again
and
tell
hezekiah
the
captain
of
my
people
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
heal
thee
on
the
third
day
thou
shalt
go
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
20
6
and
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
defend
this
city
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david’s
sake
20
7
and
isaiah
said
take
a
lump
of
figs
and
they
took
and
laid
it
on
the
boil
and
he
recovered
20
8
and
hezekiah
said
unto
isaiah
what
shall
be
the
sign
that
the
lord
will
heal
me
and
that
i
shall
go
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
the
third
day
20
9
and
isaiah
said
this
sign
shalt
thou
have
of
the
lord
that
the
lord
will
do
the
thing
that
he
hath
spoken
shall
the
shadow
go
forward
ten
degrees
or
go
back
ten
degrees
20
10
and
hezekiah
answered
it
is
a
light
thing
for
the
shadow
to
go
down
ten
degrees
nay
but
let
the
shadow
return
backward
ten
degrees
20
11
and
isaiah
the
prophet
cried
unto
the
lord
and
he
brought
the
shadow
ten
degrees
backward
by
which
it
had
gone
down
in
the
dial
of
ahaz
20
12
at
that
time
berodachbaladan
the
son
of
baladan
king
of
babylon
sent
letters
and
a
present
unto
hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
hezekiah
had
been
sick
20
13
and
hezekiah
hearkened
unto
them
and
shewed
them
all
the
house
of
his
precious
things
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
spices
and
the
precious
ointment
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
nor
in
all
his
dominion
that
hezekiah
shewed
them
not
20
14
then
came
isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
what
said
these
men
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee
and
hezekiah
said
they
are
come
from
a
far
country
even
from
babylon
20
15
and
he
said
what
have
they
seen
in
thine
house
and
hezekiah
answered
all
the
things
that
are
in
mine
house
have
they
seen
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
i
have
not
shewed
them
20
16
and
isaiah
said
unto
hezekiah
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
20
17
behold
the
days
come
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
unto
this
day
shall
be
carried
into
babylon
nothing
shall
be
left
saith
the
lord
20
18
and
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee
which
thou
shalt
beget
shall
they
take
away
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
babylon
20
19
then
said
hezekiah
unto
isaiah
good
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
thou
hast
spoken
and
he
said
is
it
not
good
if
peace
and
truth
be
in
my
days
20
20
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
hezekiah
and
all
his
might
and
how
he
made
a
pool
and
a
conduit
and
brought
water
into
the
city
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
20
21
and
hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
21
1
manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
hephzibah
21
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
21
3
for
he
built
up
again
the
high
places
which
hezekiah
his
father
had
destroyed
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
baal
and
made
a
grove
as
did
ahab
king
of
israel
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
them
21
4
and
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
lord
of
which
the
lord
said
in
jerusalem
will
i
put
my
name
21
5
and
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
21
6
and
he
made
his
son
pass
through
the
fire
and
observed
times
and
used
enchantments
and
dealt
with
familiar
spirits
and
wizards
he
wrought
much
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
21
7
and
he
set
a
graven
image
of
the
grove
that
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
which
the
lord
said
to
david
and
to
solomon
his
son
in
this
house
and
in
jerusalem
which
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
tribes
of
israel
will
i
put
my
name
for
ever
21
8
neither
will
i
make
the
feet
of
israel
move
any
more
out
of
the
land
which
i
gave
their
fathers
only
if
they
will
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
them
and
according
to
all
the
law
that
my
servant
moses
commanded
them
21
9
but
they
hearkened
not
and
manasseh
seduced
them
to
do
more
evil
than
did
the
nations
whom
the
lord
destroyed
before
the
children
of
israel
21
10
and
the
lord
spake
by
his
servants
the
prophets
saying
21
11
because
manasseh
king
of
judah
hath
done
these
abominations
and
hath
done
wickedly
above
all
that
the
amorites
did
which
were
before
him
and
hath
made
judah
also
to
sin
with
his
idols
21
12
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
i
am
bringing
such
evil
upon
jerusalem
and
judah
that
whosoever
heareth
of
it
both
his
ears
shall
tingle
21
13
and
i
will
stretch
over
jerusalem
the
line
of
samaria
and
the
plummet
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
i
will
wipe
jerusalem
as
a
man
wipeth
a
dish
wiping
it
and
turning
it
upside
down
21
14
and
i
will
forsake
the
remnant
of
mine
inheritance
and
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
they
shall
become
a
prey
and
a
spoil
to
all
their
enemies
21
15
because
they
have
done
that
which
was
evil
in
my
sight
and
have
provoked
me
to
anger
since
the
day
their
fathers
came
forth
out
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
21
16
moreover
manasseh
shed
innocent
blood
very
much
till
he
had
filled
jerusalem
from
one
end
to
another
beside
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
judah
to
sin
in
doing
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
21
17
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
manasseh
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
sin
that
he
sinned
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
21
18
and
manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
his
own
house
in
the
garden
of
uzza
and
amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
21
19
amon
was
twenty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
two
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
meshullemeth
the
daughter
of
haruz
of
jotbah
21
20
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
his
father
manasseh
did
21
21
and
he
walked
in
all
the
way
that
his
father
walked
in
and
served
the
idols
that
his
father
served
and
worshipped
them
21
22
and
he
forsook
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
and
walked
not
in
the
way
of
the
lord
21
23
and
the
servants
of
amon
conspired
against
him
and
slew
the
king
in
his
own
house
21
24
and
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
amon
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead
21
25
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
amon
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
21
26
and
he
was
buried
in
his
sepulchre
in
the
garden
of
uzza
and
josiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
22
1
josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
thirty
and
one
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
jedidah
the
daughter
of
adaiah
of
boscath
22
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
all
the
way
of
david
his
father
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
22
3
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
josiah
that
the
king
sent
shaphan
the
son
of
azaliah
the
son
of
meshullam
the
scribe
to
the
house
of
the
lord
saying
22
4
go
up
to
hilkiah
the
high
priest
that
he
may
sum
the
silver
which
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
which
the
keepers
of
the
door
have
gathered
of
the
people
22
5
and
let
them
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
doers
of
the
work
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
let
them
give
it
to
the
doers
of
the
work
which
is
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
22
6
unto
carpenters
and
builders
and
masons
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewn
stone
to
repair
the
house
22
7
howbeit
there
was
no
reckoning
made
with
them
of
the
money
that
was
delivered
into
their
hand
because
they
dealt
faithfully
22
8
and
hilkiah
the
high
priest
said
unto
shaphan
the
scribe
i
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
shaphan
and
he
read
it
22
9
and
shaphan
the
scribe
came
to
the
king
and
brought
the
king
word
again
and
said
thy
servants
have
gathered
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
do
the
work
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
22
10
and
shaphan
the
scribe
shewed
the
king
saying
hilkiah
the
priest
hath
delivered
me
a
book
and
shaphan
read
it
before
the
king
22
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
law
that
he
rent
his
clothes
22
12
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
the
priest
and
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
achbor
the
son
of
michaiah
and
shaphan
the
scribe
and
asahiah
a
servant
of
the
king’s
saying
22
13
go
ye
enquire
of
the
lord
for
me
and
for
the
people
and
for
all
judah
concerning
the
words
of
this
book
that
is
found
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
lord
that
is
kindled
against
us
because
our
fathers
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
this
book
to
do
according
unto
all
that
which
is
written
concerning
us
22
14
so
hilkiah
the
priest
and
ahikam
and
achbor
and
shaphan
and
asahiah
went
unto
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
the
son
of
tikvah
the
son
of
harhas
keeper
of
the
wardrobe
(now
she
dwelt
in
jerusalem
in
the
college
)
and
they
communed
with
her
22
15
and
she
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
tell
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me
22
16
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
the
king
of
judah
hath
read
22
17
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
kindled
against
this
place
and
shall
not
be
quenched
22
18
but
to
the
king
of
judah
which
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
lord
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
as
touching
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
22
19
because
thine
heart
was
tender
and
thou
hast
humbled
thyself
before
the
lord
when
thou
heardest
what
i
spake
against
this
place
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
that
they
should
become
a
desolation
and
a
curse
and
hast
rent
thy
clothes
and
wept
before
me
i
also
have
heard
thee
saith
the
lord
22
20
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
thee
unto
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
into
thy
grave
in
peace
and
thine
eyes
shall
not
see
all
the
evil
which
i
will
bring
upon
this
place
and
they
brought
the
king
word
again
23
1
and
the
king
sent
and
they
gathered
unto
him
all
the
elders
of
judah
and
of
jerusalem
23
2
and
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
men
of
judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
with
him
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
both
small
and
great
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
which
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
23
3
and
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
to
walk
after
the
lord
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul
to
perform
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
were
written
in
this
book
and
all
the
people
stood
to
the
covenant
23
4
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
the
high
priest
and
the
priests
of
the
second
order
and
the
keepers
of
the
door
to
bring
forth
out
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
all
the
vessels
that
were
made
for
baal
and
for
the
grove
and
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
he
burned
them
without
jerusalem
in
the
fields
of
kidron
and
carried
the
ashes
of
them
unto
bethel
23
5
and
he
put
down
the
idolatrous
priests
whom
the
kings
of
judah
had
ordained
to
burn
incense
in
the
high
places
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
places
round
about
jerusalem
them
also
that
burned
incense
unto
baal
to
the
sun
and
to
the
moon
and
to
the
planets
and
to
all
the
host
of
heaven
23
6
and
he
brought
out
the
grove
from
the
house
of
the
lord
without
jerusalem
unto
the
brook
kidron
and
burned
it
at
the
brook
kidron
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder
and
cast
the
powder
thereof
upon
the
graves
of
the
children
of
the
people
23
7
and
he
brake
down
the
houses
of
the
sodomites
that
were
by
the
house
of
the
lord
where
the
women
wove
hangings
for
the
grove
23
8
and
he
brought
all
the
priests
out
of
the
cities
of
judah
and
defiled
the
high
places
where
the
priests
had
burned
incense
from
geba
to
beersheba
and
brake
down
the
high
places
of
the
gates
that
were
in
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
joshua
the
governor
of
the
city
which
were
on
a
man’s
left
hand
at
the
gate
of
the
city
23
9
nevertheless
the
priests
of
the
high
places
came
not
up
to
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
jerusalem
but
they
did
eat
of
the
unleavened
bread
among
their
brethren
23
10
and
he
defiled
topheth
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
children
of
hinnom
that
no
man
might
make
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
molech
23
11
and
he
took
away
the
horses
that
the
kings
of
judah
had
given
to
the
sun
at
the
entering
in
of
the
house
of
the
lord
by
the
chamber
of
nathanmelech
the
chamberlain
which
was
in
the
suburbs
and
burned
the
chariots
of
the
sun
with
fire
23
12
and
the
altars
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
upper
chamber
of
ahaz
which
the
kings
of
judah
had
made
and
the
altars
which
manasseh
had
made
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
did
the
king
beat
down
and
brake
them
down
from
thence
and
cast
the
dust
of
them
into
the
brook
kidron
23
13
and
the
high
places
that
were
before
jerusalem
which
were
on
the
right
hand
of
the
mount
of
corruption
which
solomon
the
king
of
israel
had
builded
for
ashtoreth
the
abomination
of
the
zidonians
and
for
chemosh
the
abomination
of
the
moabites
and
for
milcom
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
ammon
did
the
king
defile
23
14
and
he
brake
in
pieces
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
filled
their
places
with
the
bones
of
men
23
15
moreover
the
altar
that
was
at
bethel
and
the
high
place
which
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
had
made
both
that
altar
and
the
high
place
he
brake
down
and
burned
the
high
place
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder
and
burned
the
grove
23
16
and
as
josiah
turned
himself
he
spied
the
sepulchres
that
were
there
in
the
mount
and
sent
and
took
the
bones
out
of
the
sepulchres
and
burned
them
upon
the
altar
and
polluted
it
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
the
man
of
god
proclaimed
who
proclaimed
these
words
23
17
then
he
said
what
title
is
that
that
i
see
and
the
men
of
the
city
told
him
it
is
the
sepulchre
of
the
man
of
god
which
came
from
judah
and
proclaimed
these
things
that
thou
hast
done
against
the
altar
of
bethel
23
18
and
he
said
let
him
alone
let
no
man
move
his
bones
so
they
let
his
bones
alone
with
the
bones
of
the
prophet
that
came
out
of
samaria
23
19
and
all
the
houses
also
of
the
high
places
that
were
in
the
cities
of
samaria
which
the
kings
of
israel
had
made
to
provoke
the
lord
to
anger
josiah
took
away
and
did
to
them
according
to
all
the
acts
that
he
had
done
in
bethel
23
20
and
he
slew
all
the
priests
of
the
high
places
that
were
there
upon
the
altars
and
burned
men’s
bones
upon
them
and
returned
to
jerusalem
23
21
and
the
king
commanded
all
the
people
saying
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
your
god
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
this
covenant
23
22
surely
there
was
not
holden
such
a
passover
from
the
days
of
the
judges
that
judged
israel
nor
in
all
the
days
of
the
kings
of
israel
nor
of
the
kings
of
judah
23
23
but
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
josiah
wherein
this
passover
was
holden
to
the
lord
in
jerusalem
23
24
moreover
the
workers
with
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
and
the
images
and
the
idols
and
all
the
abominations
that
were
spied
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
jerusalem
did
josiah
put
away
that
he
might
perform
the
words
of
the
law
which
were
written
in
the
book
that
hilkiah
the
priest
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
23
25
and
like
unto
him
was
there
no
king
before
him
that
turned
to
the
lord
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
might
according
to
all
the
law
of
moses
neither
after
him
arose
there
any
like
him
23
26
notwithstanding
the
lord
turned
not
from
the
fierceness
of
his
great
wrath
wherewith
his
anger
was
kindled
against
judah
because
of
all
the
provocations
that
manasseh
had
provoked
him
withal
23
27
and
the
lord
said
i
will
remove
judah
also
out
of
my
sight
as
i
have
removed
israel
and
will
cast
off
this
city
jerusalem
which
i
have
chosen
and
the
house
of
which
i
said
my
name
shall
be
there
23
28
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
josiah
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
23
29
in
his
days
pharaohnechoh
king
of
egypt
went
up
against
the
king
of
assyria
to
the
river
euphrates
and
king
josiah
went
against
him
and
he
slew
him
at
megiddo
when
he
had
seen
him
23
30
and
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
dead
from
megiddo
and
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
buried
him
in
his
own
sepulchre
and
the
people
of
the
land
took
jehoahaz
the
son
of
josiah
and
anointed
him
and
made
him
king
in
his
father’s
stead
23
31
jehoahaz
was
twenty
and
three
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
three
months
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
hamutal
the
daughter
of
jeremiah
of
libnah
23
32
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
fathers
had
done
23
33
and
pharaohnechoh
put
him
in
bands
at
riblah
in
the
land
of
hamath
that
he
might
not
reign
in
jerusalem
and
put
the
land
to
a
tribute
of
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
a
talent
of
gold
23
34
and
pharaohnechoh
made
eliakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
in
the
room
of
josiah
his
father
and
turned
his
name
to
jehoiakim
and
took
jehoahaz
away
and
he
came
to
egypt
and
died
there
23
35
and
jehoiakim
gave
the
silver
and
the
gold
to
pharaoh
but
he
taxed
the
land
to
give
the
money
according
to
the
commandment
of
pharaoh
he
exacted
the
silver
and
the
gold
of
the
people
of
the
land
of
every
one
according
to
his
taxation
to
give
it
unto
pharaohnechoh
23
36
jehoiakim
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
zebudah
the
daughter
of
pedaiah
of
rumah
23
37
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
fathers
had
done
24
1
in
his
days
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
came
up
and
jehoiakim
became
his
servant
three
years
then
he
turned
and
rebelled
against
him
24
2
and
the
lord
sent
against
him
bands
of
the
chaldees
and
bands
of
the
syrians
and
bands
of
the
moabites
and
bands
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
sent
them
against
judah
to
destroy
it
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servants
the
prophets
24
3
surely
at
the
commandment
of
the
lord
came
this
upon
judah
to
remove
them
out
of
his
sight
for
the
sins
of
manasseh
according
to
all
that
he
did
24
4
and
also
for
the
innocent
blood
that
he
shed
for
he
filled
jerusalem
with
innocent
blood
which
the
lord
would
not
pardon
24
5
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoiakim
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
24
6
so
jehoiakim
slept
with
his
fathers
and
jehoiachin
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
24
7
and
the
king
of
egypt

10
11
and
when
all
jabeshgilead
heard
all
that
the
philistines
had
done
to
saul
10
12
they
arose
all
the
valiant
men
and
took
away
the
body
of
saul
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons
and
brought
them
to
jabesh
and
buried
their
bones
under
the
oak
in
jabesh
and
fasted
seven
days
10
13
so
saul
died
for
his
transgression
which
he
committed
against
the
lord
even
against
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
kept
not
and
also
for
asking
counsel
of
one
that
had
a
familiar
spirit
to
enquire
of
it
10
14
and
enquired
not
of
the
lord
therefore
he
slew
him
and
turned
the
kingdom
unto
david
the
son
of
jesse
11
1
then
all
israel
gathered
themselves
to
david
unto
hebron
saying
behold
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh
11
2
and
moreover
in
time
past
even
when
saul
was
king
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
israel
and
the
lord
thy
god
said
unto
thee
thou
shalt
feed
my
people
israel
and
thou
shalt
be
ruler
over
my
people
israel
11
3
therefore
came
all
the
elders
of
israel
to
the
king
to
hebron
and
david
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
hebron
before
the
lord
and
they
anointed
david
king
over
israel
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
by
samuel
11
4
and
david
and
all
israel
went
to
jerusalem
which
is
jebus
where
the
jebusites
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
11
5
and
the
inhabitants
of
jebus
said
to
david
thou
shalt
not
come
hither
nevertheless
david
took
the
castle
of
zion
which
is
the
city
of
david
11
6
and
david
said
whosoever
smiteth
the
jebusites
first
shall
be
chief
and
captain
so
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
went
first
up
and
was
chief
11
7
and
david
dwelt
in
the
castle
therefore
they
called
it
the
city
of
david
11
8
and
he
built
the
city
round
about
even
from
millo
round
about
and
joab
repaired
the
rest
of
the
city
11
9
so
david
waxed
greater
and
greater
for
the
lord
of
hosts
was
with
him
11
10
these
also
are
the
chief
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
who
strengthened
themselves
with
him
in
his
kingdom
and
with
all
israel
to
make
him
king
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
concerning
israel
11
11
and
this
is
the
number
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
jashobeam
an
hachmonite
the
chief
of
the
captains
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
slain
by
him
at
one
time
11
12
and
after
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
dodo
the
ahohite
who
was
one
of
the
three
mighties
11
13
he
was
with
david
at
pasdammim
and
there
the
philistines
were
gathered
together
to
battle
where
was
a
parcel
of
ground
full
of
barley
and
the
people
fled
from
before
the
philistines
11
14
and
they
set
themselves
in
the
midst
of
that
parcel
and
delivered
it
and
slew
the
philistines
and
the
lord
saved
them
by
a
great
deliverance
11
15
now
three
of
the
thirty
captains
went
down
to
the
rock
to
david
into
the
cave
of
adullam
and
the
host
of
the
philistines
encamped
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
11
16
and
david
was
then
in
the
hold
and
the
philistines’
garrison
was
then
at
bethlehem
11
17
and
david
longed
and
said
oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
is
at
the
gate
11
18
and
the
three
brake
through
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
was
by
the
gate
and
took
it
and
brought
it
to
david
but
david
would
not
drink
of
it
but
poured
it
out
to
the
lord
11
19
and
said
my
god
forbid
it
me
that
i
should
do
this
thing
shall
i
drink
the
blood
of
these
men
that
have
put
their
lives
in
jeopardy
for
with
the
jeopardy
of
their
lives
they
brought
it
therefore
he
would
not
drink
it
these
things
did
these
three
mightiest
11
20
and
abishai
the
brother
of
joab
he
was
chief
of
the
three
for
lifting
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
he
slew
them
and
had
a
name
among
the
three
11
21
of
the
three
he
was
more
honourable
than
the
two
for
he
was
their
captain
howbeit
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three
11
22
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
son
of
a
valiant
man
of
kabzeel
who
had
done
many
acts
he
slew
two
lionlike
men
of
moab
also
he
went
down
and
slew
a
lion
in
a
pit
in
a
snowy
day
11
23
and
he
slew
an
egyptian
a
man
of
great
stature
five
cubits
high
and
in
the
egyptian’s
hand
was
a
spear
like
a
weaver’s
beam
and
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
egyptian’s
hand
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear
11
24
these
things
did
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
had
the
name
among
the
three
mighties
11
25
behold
he
was
honourable

over

12
15
these
are

that
went

they
put
to

all
them
of

16
and
there
came

to

unto

17
and
david
went

answered
and
said
unto

if
ye
be
come
peaceably
unto
me
to
help
me
mine
heart
shall
be
knit
unto
you
but
if

there
is
no
wrong
in
mine
hands
the
god
of

fathers
look
thereon
and
rebuke
it
12
18
then
the
spirit
came
upon

who
was
chief
of

he
said
thine

thou

peace
peace
be
unto
thee
and
peace
be
to

for
thy
god
helpeth
thee
then
david
received
them
and
made
them
captains
of
the
band
12
19
and
there
fell
some
of
manasseh
to
david
when
he
came
with
the
philistines
against
saul
to
battle
but
they
helped
them
not
for
the
lords
of
the

upon
advisement
sent
him
away
saying
he
will
fall
to
his
master
saul
to
the

12

for
they
were
all
mighty

of
valour
and
were
captains
in

12
22
for
at

time
day

to

him
until
it
was
a
great
host
like
the

23
and
these

timbrels
and
with
cymbals
and
with
trumpets
13
9
and
when
they
came
unto
the
threshingfloor
of
chidon
uzza
put
forth
his
hand
to
hold
the
ark
for
the
oxen
stumbled
13
10
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
uzza
and
he
smote
him
because
he
put
his
hand
to
the
ark
and
there
he
died
before
god
13
11
and
david
was
displeased
because
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
upon
uzza
wherefore
that
place
is
called
perezuzza
to
this
day
13
12
and
david
was
afraid
of
god
that
day
saying
how
shall
i
bring
the
ark
of
god
home
to
me
13
13
so
david
brought
not
the
ark
home
to
himself
to
the
city
of
david
but
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
13
14
and
the
ark
of
god
remained
with
the
family
of
obededom
in
his
house
three
months
and
the
lord
blessed
the
house
of
obededom
and
all
that
he
had
14
1
now
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
messengers
to
david
and
timber
of
cedars
with
masons
and
carpenters
to
build
him
an
house
14
2
and
david
perceived
that
the
lord
had
confirmed
him
king
over
israel
for
his
kingdom
was
lifted
up
on
high
because
of
his
people
israel
14
3
and
david
took
more
wives
at
jerusalem
and
david
begat
more
sons
and
daughters
14
4
now
these
are
the
names
of
his
children
which
he
had
in
jerusalem
shammua
and
shobab
nathan
and
solomon
14
5
and
ibhar
and
elishua
and
elpalet
14
6
and
nogah
and
nepheg
and
japhia
14
7
and
elishama
and
beeliada
and
eliphalet
14
8
and
when
the
philistines
heard
that
david
was
anointed
king
over
all
israel
all
the
philistines
went
up
to
seek
david
and
david
heard
of
it
and
went
out
against
them
14
9
and
the
philistines
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
14
10
and
david
enquired
of
god
saying
shall
i
go
up
against
the
philistines
and
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
up
for
i
will
deliver
them
into
thine
hand
14
11
so
they
came
up
to
baalperazim
and
david
smote
them
there
then
david
said
god
hath
broken
in
upon
mine
enemies
by
mine
hand
like
the
breaking
forth
of
waters
therefore
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
baalperazim
14
12
and
when
they
had
left
their
gods
there
david
gave
a
commandment
and
they
were
burned
with
fire
14
13
and
the
philistines
yet
again
spread
themselves
abroad
in
the
valley
14
14
therefore
david
enquired
again
of
god
and
god
said
unto
him
go
not
up
after
them
turn
away
from
them
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees
14
15
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
shalt
hear
a
sound
of
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
that
then
thou
shalt
go
out
to
battle
for
god
is
gone
forth
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
philistines
14
16
david
therefore
did
as
god
commanded
him
and
they
smote
the
host
of
the
philistines
from
gibeon
even
to
gazer
14
17
and
the
fame
of
david
went
out
into
all
lands
and
the
lord
brought
the
fear
of
him
upon
all
nations
15
1
and
david
made
him
houses
in
the
city
of
david
and
prepared
a
place
for
the
ark
of
god
and
pitched
for
it
a
tent
15
2
then
david
said
none
ought
to
carry
the
ark
of
god
but
the
levites
for
them
hath
the
lord
chosen
to
carry
the
ark
of
god
and
to
minister
unto
him
for
ever
15
3
and
david
gathered
all
israel
together
to
jerusalem
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
unto
his
place
which
he
had
prepared
for
it
15
4
and
david
assembled
the
children
of
aaron
and
the
levites
15
5
of
the
sons
of
kohath
uriel
the
chief
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
twenty
15
6
of
the
sons
of
merari
asaiah
the
chief
and
his
brethren
two
hundred
and
twenty
15
7
of
the
sons
of
gershom
joel
the
chief
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
thirty
15
8
of
the
sons
of
elizaphan
shemaiah
the
chief
and
his
brethren
two
hundred
15
9
of
the
sons
of
hebron
eliel
the
chief
and
his
brethren
fourscore
15
10
of
the
sons
of
uzziel
amminadab
the
chief
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
twelve
15
11
and
david
called
for
zadok
and
abiathar
the
priests
and
for
the
levites
for
uriel
asaiah
and
joel
shemaiah
and
eliel
and
amminadab
15
12
and
said
unto
them
ye
are
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
levites
sanctify
yourselves
both
ye
and
your
brethren
that
ye
may
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
unto
the
place
that
i
have
prepared
for
it
15
13
for
because
ye
did
it
not
at
the
first
the
lord
our
god
made
a
breach
upon
us
for
that
we
sought
him
not
after
the
due
order
15
14
so
the
priests
and
the
levites
sanctified
themselves
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
15
15
and
the
children
of
the
levites
bare
the
ark
of
god
upon
their
shoulders
with
the
staves
thereon
as
moses
commanded
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
15
16
and
david
spake
to
the
chief
of
the
levites
to
appoint
their
brethren
to
be
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick
psalteries
and
harps
and
cymbals
sounding
by
lifting
up
the
voice
with
joy
15
17
so
the
levites
appointed
heman
the
son
of
joel
and
of
his
brethren
asaph
the
son
of
berechiah
and
of
the
sons
of
merari
their
brethren
ethan
the
son
of
kushaiah
15
18
and
with
them
their
brethren
of
the
second
degree
zechariah
ben
and
jaaziel
and
shemiramoth
and
jehiel
and
unni
eliab
and
benaiah
and
maaseiah
and
mattithiah
and
elipheleh
and
mikneiah
and
obededom
and
jeiel
the
porters
15
19
so
the
singers
heman
asaph
and
ethan
were
appointed
to
sound
with
cymbals
of
brass
15
20
and
zechariah
and
aziel
and
shemiramoth
and
jehiel
and
unni
and
eliab
and
maaseiah
and
benaiah
with
psalteries
on
alamoth
15
21
and
mattithiah
and
elipheleh
and
mikneiah
and
obededom
and
jeiel
and
azaziah
with
harps
on
the
sheminith
to
excel
15
22
and
chenaniah
chief
of
the
levites
was
for
song
he
instructed
about
the
song
because
he
was
skilful
15
23
and
berechiah
and
elkanah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
ark
15
24
and
shebaniah
and
jehoshaphat
and
nethaneel
and
amasai
and
zechariah
and
benaiah
and
eliezer
the
priests
did
blow
with
the
trumpets
before
the
ark
of
god
and
obededom
and
jehiah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
ark
15
25
so
david
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
the
captains
over
thousands
went
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
out
of
the
house
of
obededom
with
joy
15
26
and
it
came
to
pass
when
god
helped
the
levites
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
that
they
offered
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
15
27
and
david
was
clothed
with
a
robe
of
fine
linen
and
all
the
levites
that
bare
the
ark
and
the
singers
and
chenaniah
the
master
of
the
song
with
the
singers
david
also
had
upon
him
an
ephod
of
linen
15
28
thus
all
israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
with
shouting
and
with
sound
of
the
cornet
and
with
trumpets
and
with
cymbals
making
a
noise
with
psalteries
and
harps
15
29
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
came
to
the
city
of
david
that
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
looking
out
at
a
window
saw
king
david
dancing
and
playing
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart
16
1
so
they
brought
the
ark
of
god
and
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
tent
that
david
had
pitched
for
it
and
they
offered
burnt
sacrifices
and
peace
offerings
before
god
16
2
and
when
david
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
peace
offerings
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
lord
16
3
and
he
dealt
to
every
one
of
israel
both
man
and
woman
to
every
one
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
good
piece
of
flesh
and
a
flagon
of
wine
16
4
and
he
appointed
certain
of
the
levites
to
minister
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
to
record
and
to
thank
and
praise
the
lord
god
of
israel
16
5
asaph
the
chief
and
next
to
him
zechariah
jeiel
and
shemiramoth
and
jehiel
and
mattithiah
and
eliab
and
benaiah
and
obededom
and
jeiel
with
psalteries
and
with
harps
but
asaph
made
a
sound
with
cymbals
16
6
benaiah
also
and
jahaziel
the
priests
with
trumpets
continually
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
16
7
then
on
that
day
david
delivered
first
this
psalm
to
thank
the
lord
into
the
hand
of
asaph
and
his
brethren
16
8
give

hath
done
his

and
the

of
his
mouth
16
13
o
ye

of
israel
his

ye
children
of
jacob
his
chosen
ones
16
14
he
is
the
lord

the
earth
16
15
be
ye

always
of

thousand
generations
16
16
even
of
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
abraham
and
of
his
oath
unto
isaac
16
17
and
hath
confirmed
the
same
to
jacob
for
a
law
and
to
israel
for
an
everlasting
covenant
16
18
saying
unto
thee
will
i
give
the
land
of
canaan
the
lot
of
your
inheritance
16
19
when
ye
were
but
few
even
a
few
and
strangers
in
it
16
20
and
when
they
went
from
nation
to
nation
and
from
one
kingdom
to
another
people
16
21
he
suffered
no
man
to
do
them
wrong
yea
he
reproved
kings
for
their
sakes
16
22
saying
touch
not
mine
anointed
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm
16
23
sing
unto
the
lord
all
the
earth
shew

16
24
declare
his
glory

heathen
his
marvellous
works
among

nations
16
25
for

is
the
lord
and
greatly
to
be
praised
he
also
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods
16
26
for
all
the
gods
of
the
people
are
idols
but
the

16
30
fear
before
him
all
the
earth
the
world
also
shall
be
stable
that
it
be
not
moved
16
31
let
the
heavens
be
glad
and
let
the
earth
rejoice
and
let
men
say
among
the
nations
the
lord
reigneth
16
32
let
the
sea
roar
and
the
fulness
thereof
let
the
fields
rejoice
and
all
that
is
therein
16
33
then
shall
the
trees
of
the
wood
sing
out
at
the
presence
of
the
lord
because
he
cometh
to
judge
the
earth
16
34
o
give

unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
16
35
and
say
ye
save
us
o
god
of
our
salvation
and
gather
us
together
and
deliver
us
from
the
heathen
that
we
may
give
thanks
to
thy
holy
name
and
glory
in
thy
praise
16
36
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
for
ever
and
ever
and
all
the
people
said
amen
and
praised
the
lord
16
37
so
he
left
there
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the

asaph
and
his

16
39
and
zadok
the

and
his

the

before
the

of
the

in
the
high
place
that

16
40
to

41
and
with
them

and
the

16
43
and
all
the
people
departed
every
man
to
his
house
and
david
returned
to
bless
his
house
17
1
now
it
came
to
pass
as
david
sat
in
his
house
that
david
said
to
nathan
the
prophet
lo
i
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedars
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
remaineth
under
curtains
17
2
then
nathan
said
unto
david
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
for
god
is
with
thee
17
3
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
word
of
god
came
to
nathan
saying
17
4
go
and
tell
david
my
servant
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
not
build
me
an
house
to
dwell
in
17
5
for
i
have
not
dwelt
in
an
house
since
the
day
that
i
brought
up
israel
unto
this
day
but
have
gone
from
tent
to
tent
and
from
one
tabernacle
to
another
17
6
wheresoever
i
have
walked
with
all
israel
spake
i
a
word
to
any
of
the
judges
of
israel
whom
i
commanded
to
feed
my
people
saying
why
have
ye
not
built
me
an
house
of
cedars
17
7
now
therefore
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote
even
from
following
the
sheep
that
thou
shouldest
be
ruler
over
my
people
israel
17
8
and
i
have
been
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
hast
walked
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee
and
have
made
thee
a

and

and
they
shall

no

neither

the
children
of

more
as
at

17
10
and

time
that

people

moreover
i
will
subdue

enemies
furthermore
i
tell

that

lord
will
build

an
house
17
11
and
it
shall
come
to

when

that

must
go
to

that
i
will

i

will
not
take
my
mercy
away
from

as

took
it
from

17
14
but
i
will
settle
him
in
mine
house
and
in
my
kingdom
for
ever
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
for

17
15
according
to
all
these
words
and
according
to
all
this
vision
so
did
nathan
speak
unto
david
17
16
and
david
the
king
came
and
sat
before
the
lord
and
said
who
am
i
o
lord
god
and
what
is
mine
house
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto
17
17
and
yet
this
was
a
small
thing
in
thine
eyes
o
god
for
thou
hast
also
spoken
of
thy
servant’s
house
for
a
great
while
to
come
and
hast
regarded
me
according
to
the
estate
of
a
man
of
high
degree
o
lord
god
17
18
what
can
david
speak
more
to
thee
for
the
honour
of
thy
servant
for
thou
knowest
thy
servant
17
19
o
lord
for
thy
servant’s
sake
and
according
to
thine
own
heart
hast
thou
done
all
this
greatness
in
making
known
all
these
great
things
17
20
o
lord
there
is
none
like
thee
neither
is
there
any
god
beside
thee
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
17
21
and
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
israel
whom
god
went
to
redeem
to
be
his
own
people
to
make
thee
a
name
of
greatness
and
terribleness
by
driving
out
nations
from
before
thy
people
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
out
of
egypt
17
22
for
thy
people
israel
didst
thou
make
thine
own
people
for
ever
and
thou
lord
becamest
their
god
17
23
therefore
now
lord
let
the
thing
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
be
established
for
ever
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
17
24
let
it
even
be
established
that
thy
name
may
be
magnified
for
ever
saying
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
god
of
israel
even
a
god
to
israel
and
let
the
house
of
david
thy
servant
be
established
before
thee
17
25
for
thou
o
my
god
hast
told
thy
servant
that
thou
wilt
build
him
an
house
therefore
thy
servant
hath
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
before
thee
17
26
and
now
lord
thou
art
god
and
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant
17
27
now
therefore
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant
that
it
may
be
before
thee
for
ever
for
thou
blessest
o
lord
and
it
shall
be
blessed
for
ever
18
1
now
after
this
it
came
to
pass
that
david
smote
the
philistines
and
subdued
them
and
took
gath
and
her
towns
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
18
2
and
he
smote
moab
and
the
moabites
became
david’s
servants
and
brought
gifts
18
3
and
david
smote
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
unto
hamath
as
he
went
to
stablish
his
dominion
by
the
river
euphrates
18
4
and
david
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots
and
seven
thousand
horsemen
and
twenty
thousand
footmen
david
also
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses
but
reserved
of
them
an
hundred
chariots
18
5
and
when
the
syrians
of
damascus
came
to
help
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
david
slew
of
the
syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men
18
6
then
david
put
garrisons
in
syriadamascus
and
the
syrians
became
david’s
servants
and
brought
gifts
thus
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
18
7
and
david
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
hadarezer
and
brought
them
to
jerusalem
18
8
likewise
from
tibhath
and
from
chun
cities
of
hadarezer
brought
david
very
much
brass
wherewith
solomon
made
the
brasen
sea
and
the
pillars
and
the
vessels
of
brass
18
9
now
when
tou
king
of
hamath
heard
how
david
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
18
10
he
sent
hadoram
his
son
to
king
david
to
enquire
of
his
welfare
and
to
congratulate
him
because
he
had
fought
against
hadarezer
and
smitten
him
(for
hadarezer
had
war
with
tou
)
and
with
him
all
manner
of
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass
18
11
them
also
king
david
dedicated
unto
the
lord
with
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
he
brought
from
all
these
nations
from
edom
and
from
moab
and
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
from
the
philistines
and
from
amalek
18
12
moreover
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
slew
of
the
edomites
in
the
valley
of
salt
eighteen
thousand
18
13
and
he
put
garrisons
in
edom
and
all
the
edomites
became
david’s
servants
thus
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
18
14
so
david
reigned
over
all
israel
and
executed
judgment
and
justice
among
all
his
people
18
15
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
over
the
host
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
recorder
18
16
and
zadok
the
son
of
ahitub
and
abimelech
the
son
of
abiathar
were
the
priests
and
shavsha
was
scribe
18
17
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
was
over
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
the
sons
of
david
were
chief
about
the
king
19
1
now
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
died
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
19
2
and
david
said
i
will
shew
kindness
unto
hanun
the
son
of
nahash
because
his
father
shewed
kindness
to
me
and
david
sent
messengers
to
comfort
him
concerning
his
father
so
the
servants
of
david
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
to
hanun
to
comfort
him
19
3
but
the
princes
of
the
children
of
ammon
said
to
hanun
thinkest
thou
that
david
doth
honour
thy
father
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee
are
not
his
servants
come
unto
thee
for
to
search
and
to
overthrow
and
to
spy
out
the
land
19
4
wherefore
hanun
took
david’s
servants
and
shaved
them
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
midst
hard
by
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
19
5
then
there
went
certain
and
told
david
how
the
men
were
served
and
he
sent
to
meet
them
for
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed
and
the
king
said
tarry
at
jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown
and
then
return
19
6
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
they
had
made
themselves
odious
to
david
hanun
and
the
children
of
ammon
sent
a
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
hire
them
chariots
and
horsemen
out
of
mesopotamia
and
out
of
syriamaachah
and
out
of
zobah
19
7
so
they
hired
thirty
and
two
thousand
chariots
and
the
king
of
maachah
and
his
people
who
came
and
pitched
before
medeba
and
the
children
of
ammon
gathered
themselves
together
from
their
cities
and
came
to
battle
19
8
and
when
david
heard
of
it
he
sent
joab
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men
19
9
and
the
children
of
ammon
came
out
and
put
the
battle
in
array
before
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
kings
that
were
come
were
by
themselves
in
the
field
19
10
now
when
joab
saw
that
the
battle
was
set
against
him
before
and
behind
he
chose
out
of
all
the
choice
of
israel
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
syrians
19
11
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
unto
the
hand
of
abishai
his
brother
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
the
children
of
ammon
19
12
and
he
said
if
the
syrians
be
too
strong
for
me
then
thou
shalt
help
me
but
if
the
children
of
ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee
then
i
will
help
thee
19
13
be
of
good
courage
and
let
us
behave
ourselves
valiantly
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
god
and
let
the
lord
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
sight
19
14
so
joab
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
drew
nigh
before
the
syrians
unto
the
battle
and
they
fled
before
him
19
15
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
the
syrians
were
fled
they
likewise
fled
before
abishai
his
brother
and
entered
into
the
city
then
joab
came
to
jerusalem
19
16
and
when
the
syrians
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
they
sent
messengers
and
drew
forth
the
syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river
and
shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
hadarezer
went
before
them
19
17
and
it
was
told
david
and
he
gathered
all
israel
and
passed
over
jordan
and
came
upon
them
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
them
so
when
david
had
put
the
battle
in
array
against
the
syrians
they
fought
with
him
19
18
but
the
syrians
fled
before
israel
and
david
slew
of
the
syrians
seven
thousand
men
which
fought
in
chariots
and
forty
thousand
footmen
and
killed
shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
19
19
and
when
the
servants
of
hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
they
made
peace
with
david
and
became
his
servants
neither
would
the
syrians
help
the
children
of
ammon
any
more
20
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
year
was
expired
at
the
time
that
kings
go
out
to
battle
joab
led
forth
the
power
of
the
army
and
wasted
the
country
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
came
and
besieged
rabbah
but
david
tarried
at
jerusalem
and
joab
smote
rabbah
and
destroyed
it
20
2
and
david
took
the
crown
of
their
king
from
off
his
head
and
found
it
to
weigh
a
talent
of
gold
and
there
were
precious
stones
in
it
and
it
was
set
upon
david’s
head
and
he
brought
also
exceeding
much
spoil
out
of
the
city
20
3
and
he
brought
out
the
people
that
were
in
it
and
cut
them
with
saws
and
with
harrows
of
iron
and
with
axes
even
so
dealt
david
with
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
david
and
all
the
people
returned
to
jerusalem
20
4
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
there
arose
war
at
gezer
with
the
philistines
at
which
time
sibbechai
the
hushathite
slew
sippai
that
was
of
the
children
of
the
giant
and
they
were
subdued
20
5
and
there
was
war
again
with
the
philistines
and
elhanan
the
son
of
jair
slew
lahmi
the
brother
of
goliath
the
gittite
whose
spear
staff
was
like
a
weaver’s
beam
20
6
and
yet
again
there
was
war
at
gath
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature
whose
fingers
and
toes
were
four
and
twenty
six
on
each
hand
and
six
on
each
foot
and
he
also
was
the
son
of
the
giant
20
7
but
when
he
defied
israel
jonathan
the
son
of
shimea
david’s
brother
slew
him
20
8
these
were
born
unto
the
giant
in
gath
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
david
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
21
1
and
satan
stood
up
against
israel
and
provoked
david
to
number
israel
21
2
and
david
said
to
joab
and
to
the
rulers
of
the
people
go
number
israel
from
beersheba
even
to
dan
and
bring
the
number
of
them
to
me
that
i
may
know
it
21
3
and
joab
answered
the
lord
make
his
people
an
hundred
times
so
many
more
as
they
be
but
my
lord
the
king
are
they
not
all
my
lord’s
servants
why
then
doth
my
lord
require
this
thing
why
will
he
be
a
cause
of
trespass
to
israel
21
4
nevertheless
the
king’s
word
prevailed
against
joab
wherefore
joab
departed
and
went
throughout
all
israel
and
came
to
jerusalem
21
5
and
joab
gave
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
david
and
all
they
of
israel
were
a
thousand
thousand
and
an
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
and
judah
was
four
hundred
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
21
6
but
levi
and
benjamin
counted
he
not
among
them
for
the
king’s
word
was
abominable
to
joab
21
7
and
god
was
displeased
with
this
thing
therefore
he
smote
israel
21
8
and
david
said
unto
god
i
have
sinned
greatly
because
i
have
done
this
thing
but
now
i
beseech
thee
do
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant
for
i
have
done
very
foolishly
21
9
and
the
lord
spake
unto
gad
david’s
seer
saying
21
10
go
and
tell
david
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
offer
thee
three
things
choose
thee
one
of
them
that
i
may
do
it
unto
thee
21
11
so
gad
came
to
david
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
choose
thee
21
12
either
three
years’
famine
or
three
months
to
be
destroyed
before
thy
foes
while
that
the
sword
of
thine
enemies
overtaketh
thee
or
else
three
days
the
sword
of
the
lord
even
the
pestilence
in
the
land
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
destroying
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
now
therefore
advise
thyself
what
word
i
shall
bring
again
to
him
that
sent
me
21
13
and
david
said
unto
gad
i
am
in
a
great
strait
let
me
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
lord
for
very
great
are
his
mercies
but
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
21
14
so
the
lord
sent
pestilence
upon
israel
and
there
fell
of
israel
seventy
thousand
men
21
15
and
god
sent
an
angel
unto
jerusalem
to
destroy
it
and
as
he
was
destroying
the
lord
beheld
and
he
repented
him
of
the
evil
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed
it
is
enough
stay
now
thine
hand
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
by
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
21
16
and
david
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
stand
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven
having
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
jerusalem
then
david
and
the
elders
of
israel
who
were
clothed
in
sackcloth
fell
upon
their
faces
21
17
and
david
said
unto
god
is
it
not
i
that
commanded
the
people
to
be
numbered
even
i
it
is
that
have
sinned
and
done
evil
indeed
but
as
for
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thine
hand
i
pray
thee
o
lord
my
god
be
on
me
and
on
my
father’s
house
but
not
on
thy
people
that
they
should
be
plagued
21
18
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
commanded
gad
to
say
to
david
that
david
should
go
up
and
set
up
an
altar
unto
the
lord
in
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
21
19
and
david
went
up
at
the
saying
of
gad
which
he
spake
in
the
name
of
the
lord
21
20
and
ornan
turned
back
and
saw
the
angel
and
his
four
sons
with
him
hid
themselves
now
ornan
was
threshing
wheat
21
21
and
as
david
came
to
ornan
ornan
looked
and
saw
david
and
went
out
of
the
threshingfloor
and
bowed
himself
to
david
with
his
face
to
the
ground
21
22
then
david
said
to
ornan
grant
me
the
place
of
this
threshingfloor
that
i
may
build
an
altar
therein
unto
the
lord
thou
shalt
grant
it
me
for
the
full
price
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people
21
23
and
ornan
said
unto
david
take
it
to
thee
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
eyes
lo
i
give
thee
the
oxen
also
for
burnt
offerings
and
the
threshing
instruments
for
wood
and
the
wheat
for
the
meat
offering
i
give
it
all
21
24
and
king
david
said
to
ornan
nay
but
i
will
verily
buy
it
for
the
full
price
for
i
will
not
take
that
which
is
thine
for
the
lord
nor
offer
burnt
offerings
without
cost
21
25
so
david
gave
to
ornan
for
the
place
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
by
weight
21
26
and
david
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
and
called
upon
the
lord
and
he
answered
him
from
heaven
by
fire
upon
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
21
27
and
the
lord
commanded
the
angel
and
he
put
up
his
sword
again
into
the
sheath
thereof
21
28
at
that
time
when
david
saw
that
the
lord
had
answered
him
in
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
then
he
sacrificed
there
21
29
for
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
which
moses
made
in
the
wilderness
and
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
were
at
that
season
in
the
high
place
at
gibeon
21
30
but
david
could
not
go
before
it
to
enquire
of
god
for
he
was
afraid
because
of
the
sword
of
the
angel
of
the
lord
22
1
then
david
said
this
is
the
house
of
the
lord
god
and
this
is
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
for
israel
22
2
and
david
commanded
to
gather
together
the
strangers
that
were
in
the
land
of
israel
and
he
set
masons
to
hew
wrought
stones
to
build
the
house
of
god
22
3
and
david
prepared
iron
in
abundance
for
the
nails
for
the
doors
of
the
gates
and
for
the
joinings
and
brass
in
abundance
without
weight
22
4
also
cedar
trees
in
abundance
for
the
zidonians
and
they
of
tyre
brought
much
cedar
wood
to
david
22
5
and
david
said
solomon
my
son
is
young
and
tender
and
the
house
that
is
to
be
builded
for
the
lord
must
be
exceeding
magnifical
of
fame
and
of
glory
throughout
all
countries
i
will
therefore
now
make
preparation
for
it
so
david
prepared
abundantly
before
his
death
22
6
then
he
called
for
solomon
his
son
and
charged
him
to
build
an
house
for
the
lord
god
of
israel
22
7
and
david
said
to
solomon
my
son
as
for
me
it
was
in
my
mind
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
22
8
but
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
thou
hast
shed
blood
abundantly
and
hast
made
great
wars
thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
unto
my
name
because
thou
hast
shed
much
blood
upon
the
earth
in
my
sight
22
9
behold
a
son
shall
be
born
to
thee
who
shall
be
a
man
of
rest
and
i
will
give
him
rest
from
all
his
enemies
round
about
for
his
name
shall
be
solomon
and
i
will
give
peace
and
quietness
unto
israel
in
his
days
22
10
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
he
shall
be
my
son
and
i
will
be
his
father
and
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
over
israel
for
ever
22
11
now
my
son
the
lord
be
with
thee
and
prosper
thou
and
build
the
house
of
the
lord
thy
god
as
he
hath
said
of
thee
22
12
only
the
lord
give
thee
wisdom
and
understanding
and
give
thee
charge
concerning
israel
that
thou
mayest
keep
the
law
of
the
lord
thy
god
22
13
then
shalt
thou
prosper
if
thou
takest
heed
to
fulfil
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
the
lord
charged
moses
with
concerning
israel
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
dread
not
nor
be
dismayed
22
14
now
behold
in
my
trouble
i
have
prepared
for
the
house
of
the
lord
an
hundred
thousand
talents
of
gold
and
a
thousand
thousand
talents
of
silver
and
of
brass
and
iron
without
weight
for
it
is
in
abundance
timber
also
and
stone
have
i
prepared
and
thou
mayest
add
thereto
22
15
moreover
there
are
workmen
with
thee
in
abundance
hewers
and
workers
of
stone
and
timber
and
all
manner
of
cunning
men
for
every
manner
of
work
22
16
of
the
gold
the
silver
and
the
brass
and
the
iron
there
is
no
number
arise
therefore
and
be
doing
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
22
17
david
also
commanded
all
the
princes
of
israel
to
help
solomon
his
son
saying
22
18
is
not
the
lord
your
god
with
you
and
hath
he
not
given
you
rest
on
every
side
for
he
hath
given
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
mine
hand
and
the
land
is
subdued
before
the
lord
and
before
his
people
22
19
now
set
your
heart
and
your
soul
to
seek
the
lord
your
god
arise
therefore
and
build
ye
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
god
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
the
holy
vessels
of
god
into
the
house
that
is
to
be
built
to
the
name
of
the
lord
23
1
so
when
david
was
old
and
full
of
days
he
made
solomon
his
son
king
over
israel
23
2
and
he
gathered
together
all
the
princes
of
israel
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
23
3
now
the
levites
were
numbered
from
the
age
of
thirty
years
and
upward
and
their
number
by
their
polls
man
by
man
was
thirty
and
eight
thousand
23
4
of
which
twenty
and
four
thousand
were
to
set
forward
the
work
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
six
thousand
were
officers
and
judges
23
5
moreover
four
thousand
were
porters
and
four
thousand
praised
the
lord
with
the
instruments
which
i
made
said
david
to
praise
therewith
23
6
and
david
divided
them
into
courses
among
the
sons
of
levi
namely
gershon
kohath
and
merari
23
7
of
the
gershonites
were
laadan
and
shimei
23
8
the
sons
of
laadan
the
chief
was
jehiel
and
zetham
and
joel
three
23
9
the
sons
of
shimei
shelomith
and
haziel
and
haran
three
these
were
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
laadan
23
10
and
the
sons
of
shimei
were
jahath
zina
and
jeush
and
beriah
these
four
were
the
sons
of
shimei
23
11
and
jahath
was
the
chief
and
zizah
the
second
but
jeush
and
beriah
had
not
many
sons
therefore
they
were
in
one
reckoning
according
to
their
father’s
house
23
12
the
sons
of
kohath
amram
izhar
hebron
and
uzziel
four
23
13
the
sons
of
amram
aaron
and
moses
and
aaron
was
separated
that
he
should
sanctify
the
most
holy
things
he
and
his
sons
for
ever
to
burn
incense
before
the
lord
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
his
name
for
ever
23
14
now
concerning
moses
the
man
of
god
his
sons
were
named
of
the
tribe
of
levi
23
15
the
sons
of
moses
were
gershom
and
eliezer
23
16
of
the
sons
of
gershom
shebuel
was
the
chief
23
17
and
the
sons
of
eliezer
were
rehabiah
the
chief
and
eliezer
had
none
other
sons
but
the
sons
of
rehabiah
were
very
many
23
18
of
the
sons
of
izhar
shelomith
the
chief
23
19
of
the
sons
of
hebron
jeriah
the
first
amariah
the
second
jahaziel
the
third
and
jekameam
the
fourth
23
20
of
the
sons
of
uzziel
micah
the
first
and
jesiah
the
second
23
21
the
sons
of
merari
mahli
and
mushi
the
sons
of
mahli
eleazar
and
kish
23
22
and
eleazar
died
and
had
no
sons
but
daughters
and
their
brethren
the
sons
of
kish
took
them
23
23
the
sons
of
mushi
mahli
and
eder
and
jeremoth
three
23
24
these
were
the
sons
of
levi
after
the
house
of
their
fathers
even
the
chief
of
the
fathers
as
they
were
counted
by
number
of
names
by
their
polls
that
did
the
work
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
from
the
age
of
twenty
years
and
upward
23
25
for
david
said
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
that
they
may
dwell
in
jerusalem
for
ever
23
26
and
also
unto
the
levites
they
shall
no
more
carry
the
tabernacle
nor
any
vessels
of
it
for
the
service
thereof
23
27
for
by
the
last
words
of
david
the
levites
were
numbered
from
twenty
years
old
and
above
23
28
because
their
office
was
to
wait
on
the
sons
of
aaron
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
courts
and
in
the
chambers
and
in
the
purifying
of
all
holy
things
and
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
god
23
29
both
for
the
shewbread
and
for
the
fine
flour
for
meat
offering
and
for
the
unleavened
cakes
and
for
that
which
is
baked
in
the
pan
and
for
that
which
is
fried
and
for
all
manner
of
measure
and
size
23
30
and
to
stand
every
morning
to
thank
and
praise
the
lord
and
likewise
at
even
23
31
and
to
offer
all
burnt
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
in
the
sabbaths
in
the
new
moons
and
on
the
set
feasts
by
number
according
to
the
order
commanded
unto
them
continually
before
the
lord
23
32
and
that
they
should
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
charge
of
the
holy
place
and
the
charge
of
the
sons
of
aaron
their
brethren
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
24
1
now
these
are
the
divisions
of
the
sons
of
aaron
the
sons
of
aaron
nadab
and
abihu
eleazar
and
ithamar
24
2
but
nadab
and
abihu
died
before
their
father
and
had
no
children
therefore
eleazar
and
ithamar
executed
the
priest’s
office
24
3
and
david
distributed
them
both
zadok
of
the
sons
of
eleazar
and
ahimelech
of
the
sons
of
ithamar
according
to
their
offices
in
their
service
24
4
and
there
were
more
chief
men
found
of
the
sons
of
eleazar
than
of
the
sons
of
ithamar
and
thus
were
they
divided
among
the
sons
of
eleazar
there
were
sixteen
chief
men
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
eight
among
the
sons
of
ithamar
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
24
5
thus
were
they
divided
by
lot
one
sort
with
another
for
the
governors
of
the
sanctuary
and
governors
of
the
house
of
god
were
of
the
sons
of
eleazar
and
of
the
sons
of
ithamar
24
6
and
shemaiah
the
son
of
nethaneel
the
scribe
one
of
the
levites
wrote
them
before
the
king
and
the
princes
and
zadok
the
priest
and
ahimelech
the

of

and

furthermore
david

said
unto

hands
of

and
who
then
is
willing
to
consecrate
his
service
this
day
unto
the
lord
29
6
then
the
chief
of
the
fathers
and
princes
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds
with

to
the
treasure
of
the
house
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
jehiel
the
gershonite
29
9
then
the
people
rejoiced
for
that
they
offered
willingly
because
with
perfect
heart
they
offered
willingly
to
the
lord
and
david
the
king
also
rejoiced
with
great
joy
29
10
wherefore
david
blessed
the
lord
before
all
the
congregation
and
david
said
blessed
be
thou
lord
god
of
israel
our
father
for
ever
and
ever
29
11
thine
o
lord
is
the
greatness
and
the
power
and
the
glory
and
the
victory
and
the
majesty
for
all
that
is
in
the
heaven
and
in
the
earth
is
thine
thine
is
the
kingdom
o
lord
and
thou
art
exalted
as
head
above
all
29
12
both
riches
and
honour
come
of
thee
and
thou
reignest
over
all
and
in
thine
hand
is
power
and
might
and
in
thine
hand
it
is
to
make
great
and
to
give
strength
unto
all
29
13
now
therefore
our
god
we
thank
thee
and
praise
thy
glorious
name
29
14
but
who
am
i
and
what
is
my
people
that
we
should
be
able
to
offer
so
willingly
after
this
sort
for
all
things
come
of
thee
and
of
thine
own
have
we
given
thee
29
15
for
we
are
strangers
before
thee
and
sojourners
as
were
all
our
fathers
our
days
on
the
earth
are
as
a
shadow
and
there
is
none
abiding
29
16
o
lord
our
god
all
this
store
that
we
have
prepared
to
build
thee
an
house
for
thine
holy
name
cometh
of
thine
hand
and
is
all
thine
own
29
17
i
know
also
my
god
that
thou
triest
the
heart
and
hast
pleasure
in
uprightness
as
for
me
in
the
uprightness
of
mine
heart
i
have
willingly
offered
all
these
things
and
now
have
i
seen
with
joy
thy
people
which
are
present
here
to
offer
willingly
unto
thee
29
18
o
lord
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
of
israel
our
fathers
keep
this
for
ever
in
the
imagination
of
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
of
thy
people
and
prepare
their
heart
unto
thee
29
19
and
give
unto
solomon
my
son
a
perfect
heart
to
keep
thy
commandments
thy
testimonies
and
thy
statutes
and
to
do
all
these
things
and
to
build
the
palace
for
the
which
i
have
made
provision
29
20
and
david
said
to
all
the
congregation
now
bless
the
lord
your
god
and
all
the
congregation
blessed
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
bowed
down
their
heads
and
worshipped
the
lord
and
the
king
29
21
and
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
on
the
morrow
after
that
day
even
a
thousand
bullocks
a
thousand
rams
and
a
thousand
lambs
with
their
drink
offerings
and
sacrifices
in
abundance
for
all
israel
29
22
and
did
eat
and
drink
before
the
lord
on
that
day
with
great
gladness
and
they
made
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
the
second
time
and
anointed
him
unto
the
lord
to
be
the
chief
governor
and
zadok
to
be
priest
29
23
then
solomon
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
lord
as
king
instead
of
david
his
father
and
prospered
and
all
israel
obeyed
him
29
24
and
all
the
princes
and
the
mighty
men
and
all
the
sons
likewise
of
king
david
submitted
themselves
unto
solomon
the
king
29
25
and
the
lord
magnified
solomon
exceedingly
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
and
bestowed
upon
him
such
royal
majesty
as
had
not
been
on
any
king
before
him
in
israel
29
26
thus
david
the
son
of
jesse
reigned
over
all
israel
29
27
and
the
time
that
he
reigned
over
israel
was
forty
years
seven
years
reigned
he
in
hebron
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
29
28
and
he
died
in
a
good
old
age
full
of
days
riches
and
honour
and
solomon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
29
29
now
the
acts
of
david
the
king
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
samuel
the
seer
and
in
the
book
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
in
the
book
of
gad
the
seer
29
30
with
all
his
reign
and
his
might
and
the
times
that
went
over
him
and
over
israel
and
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries
the
second
book
of
the
chronicles
1
1
and
solomon
the
son
of
david
was
strengthened
in
his
kingdom
and
the
lord
his
god
was
with
him
and
magnified
him
exceedingly
1
2
then
solomon
spake
unto
all
israel
to
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds
and
to
the
judges
and
to
every
governor
in
all
israel
the
chief
of
the
fathers
1
3
so
solomon
and
all
the
congregation
with
him
went
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
gibeon
for
there
was
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
of
god
which
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
had
made
in
the
wilderness
1
4
but
the
ark
of
god
had
david
brought
up
from
kirjathjearim
to
the
place
which
david
had
prepared
for
it
for
he
had
pitched
a
tent
for
it
at
jerusalem
1
5
moreover
the
brasen
altar
that
bezaleel
the
son
of
uri
the
son
of
hur
had
made
he
put
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
solomon
and
the
congregation
sought
unto
it
1
6
and
solomon
went
up
thither
to
the
brasen
altar
before
the
lord
which
was
at
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
offered
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
upon
it
1
7
in
that
night
did
god
appear
unto
solomon
and
said
unto
him
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
1
8
and
solomon
said
unto
god
thou
hast
shewed
great
mercy
unto
david
my
father
and
hast
made
me
to
reign
in
his
stead
1
9
now
o
lord
god
let
thy
promise
unto
david
my
father
be
established
for
thou
hast
made
me
king
over
a
people
like
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
multitude
1
10
give
me
now
wisdom
and
knowledge
that
i
may
go
out
and
come
in
before
this
people
for
who
can
judge
this
thy
people
that
is
so
great
1
11
and
god
said
to
solomon
because
this
was
in
thine
heart
and
thou
hast
not
asked
riches
wealth
or
honour
nor
the
life
of
thine
enemies
neither
yet
hast
asked
long
life
but
hast
asked
wisdom
and
knowledge
for
thyself
that
thou
mayest
judge
my
people
over
whom
i
have
made
thee
king
1
12
wisdom
and
knowledge
is
granted
unto
thee
and
i
will
give
thee
riches
and
wealth
and
honour
such
as
none
of
the
kings
have
had
that
have
been
before
thee
neither
shall
there
any
after
thee
have
the
like
1
13
then
solomon
came
from
his
journey
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
gibeon
to
jerusalem
from
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
reigned
over
israel
1
14
and
solomon
gathered
chariots
and
horsemen
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
which
he
placed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
with
the
king
at
jerusalem
1
15
and
the
king
made
silver
and
gold
at
jerusalem
as
plenteous
as
stones
and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
vale
for
abundance
1
16
and
solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
egypt
and
linen
yarn
the
king’s
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a
price
1
17
and
they
fetched
up
and
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
a
chariot
for
six
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
so
brought
they
out
horses
for
all
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
for
the
kings
of
syria
by
their
means
2
1
and
solomon
determined
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
and
an
house
for
his
kingdom
2
2
and
solomon
told
out
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
to
bear
burdens
and
fourscore
thousand
to
hew
in
the
mountain
and
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
to
oversee
them
2
3
and
solomon
sent
to
huram
the
king
of
tyre
saying
as
thou
didst
deal
with
david
my
father
and
didst
send
him
cedars
to
build
him
an
house
to
dwell
therein
even
so
deal
with
me
2
4
behold
i
build
an
house
to
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
to
dedicate
it
to
him
and
to
burn
before

sweet
incense
and
for

continual
shewbread
and
for

morning
and
evening
on
the
sabbaths
and
on
the
new
moons
and
on
the
solemn
feasts
of
the
lord
our
god
this
is
an
ordinance
for
ever
to
israel
2
5
and
the
house
which
i
build
is
great
for
great
is
our
god
above
all
gods
2
6
but
who
is
able
to
build
him
an
house
seeing
the
heaven
and

cannot
contain
him
who
am
i
then
that
i
should
build
him
an
house
save
only
to
burn

before
him
2
7
send

now
therefore
a

work
in
gold
and
in

then
huram

huram
said

that

build

and
made
an
hundred
pomegranates
and
put

4
18
thus

made

in
great
abundance
for

19
and

assembled
themselves
unto

5
4
and

and
they
brought

these

and

of
the
lord
unto
his
place
to
the
oracle
of
the
house
into
the
most
holy
place
even
under
the
wings
of
the
cherubims
5

for
the
cherubims
spread
forth
their
wings
over
the
place
of
the
ark
and
the
cherubims
covered
the
ark
and
the
staves
thereof
above
5
9
and
they
drew
out
the
staves
of
the
ark
that
the
ends
of
the
staves
were
seen
from
the
ark
before
the
oracle
but
they
were
not
seen
without
and
there
it
is
unto
this
day
5
10
there
was
nothing
in
the
ark
save
the
two
tables
which
moses
put
therein
at
horeb
when
the
lord
made
a
covenant
with
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
out
of
egypt
5
11
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
were
come
out
of
the
holy
place
(for
all
the
priests
that
were
present
were
sanctified
and
did
not
then
wait
by
course
5
12
also
the
levites
which
were
the
singers
all
of
them
of
asaph
of
heman
of
jeduthun
with
their
sons
and
their
brethren
being
arrayed
in
white
linen
having

and
harps
stood
at
the
east
end
of
the
altar
and
with
them
an
hundred
and
twenty
priests
sounding
with
trumpets
)
5
13
it
came
even
to
pass
as
the
trumpeters
and
singers
were
as
one
to
make
one
sound
to
be
heard
in
praising
and
thanking
the
lord
and
when
they
lifted
up
their
voice
with
the
trumpets
and
cymbals
and
instruments
of
musick
and
praised
the
lord
saying
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
that
then
the
house
was
filled
with
a
cloud
even
the
house
of
the
lord
5
14
so
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
by
reason
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
house
of
god
6
1
then
said
solomon
the
lord
hath
said
that
he
would
dwell
in
the
thick
darkness
6
2
but
i
have
built
an
house
of
habitation
for
thee
and
a
place
for
thy
dwelling
for
ever
6
3
and
the
king
turned
his
face
and
blessed
the
whole
congregation
of
israel
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
stood
6
4
and
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
who
hath
with
his
hands
fulfilled
that
which
he
spake
with
his
mouth
to
my
father
david
saying
6
5
since
the
day
that
i
brought
forth
my
people
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
i
chose
no
city
among
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
build
an
house
in
that
my
name
might
be
there
neither
chose
i
any
man
to
be
a
ruler
over
my
people
israel
6
6
but
i
have
chosen
jerusalem
that
my
name
might
be
there
and
have
chosen
david
to
be
over
my
people
israel
6
7
now
it
was
in
the
heart
of
david
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
6
8
but
the
lord
said
to
david
my
father
forasmuch
as
it
was
in
thine
heart
to
build
an
house
for
my
name
thou
didst
well
in
that
it
was
in
thine
heart
6
9
notwithstanding
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
but
thy
son
which
shall
come
forth
out
of
thy
loins
he
shall
build
the
house
for
my
name
6
10
the
lord
therefore
hath
performed
his
word
that
he
hath
spoken
for
i
am
risen
up
in
the
room
of
david
my
father
and
am
set
on
the
throne
of
israel
as
the
lord
promised
and
have
built
the
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
6
11
and
in
it
have
i
put
the
ark
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
the
lord
that
he
made
with
the
children
of
israel
6
12
and
he
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
6
13
for
solomon
had
made
a
brasen
scaffold
of
five
cubits
long
and
five
cubits
broad
and
three
cubits
high
and
had
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
court
and
upon
it
he
stood
and
kneeled
down
upon
his
knees
before
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven
6
14
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
no
god
like
thee
in
the
heaven
nor
in
the
earth
which
keepest
covenant
and
shewest
mercy
unto
thy
servants
that
walk
before
thee
with
all
their
hearts
6
15
thou
which
hast
kept
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him
and
spakest
with
thy
mouth
and
hast
fulfilled
it
with
thine
hand
as
it
is
this
day
6
16
now
therefore
o
lord
god
of
israel
keep
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
in
my
sight
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
israel
yet
so
that
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
to
walk
in
my
law
as
thou
hast
walked
before
me
6
17
now
then
o
lord
god
of
israel
let
thy
word
be
verified
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
thy
servant
david
6
18
but
will
god
in
very
deed
dwell
with
men
on
the
earth
behold
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
thee
how
much
less
this
house
which
i
have
built
6
19
have
respect
therefore
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
his
supplication
o
lord
my
god
to
hearken
unto
the
cry
and
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
before
thee
6
20
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
upon
this
house
day
and
night
upon
the
place
whereof
thou
hast
said
that
thou
wouldest
put
thy
name
there
to
hearken
unto
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
toward
this
place
6
21
hearken
therefore
unto
the
supplications
of
thy
servant
and
of
thy
people
israel
which
they
shall
make
toward
this
place
hear
thou
from
thy
dwelling
place
even
from
heaven
and
when
thou
hearest
forgive
6
22
if
a
man
sin
against
his
neighbour
and
an
oath
be
laid
upon
him
to
make
him
swear
and
the
oath
come
before
thine
altar
in
this
house
6
23
then
hear
thou
from
heaven
and
do
and
judge
thy
servants
by
requiting
the
wicked
by
recompensing
his
way
upon
his
own
head
and
by
justifying
the
righteous
by
giving
him
according
to
his
righteousness
6
24
and
if
thy
people
israel
be
put
to
the
worse
before
the
enemy
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
and
shall
return
and
confess
thy
name
and
pray
and
make
supplication
before
thee
in
this
house
6
25
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
people
israel
and
bring
them
again
unto
the
land
which
thou
gavest
to
them
and
to
their
fathers
6
26
when
the
heaven
is
shut
up
and
there
is
no
rain
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
yet
if
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
confess
thy
name
and
turn
from
their
sin
when
thou
dost
afflict
them
6
27
then
hear
thou
from
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
servants
and
of
thy
people
israel
when
thou
hast
taught
them
the
good
way
wherein
they
should
walk
and
send
rain
upon
thy
land
which
thou
hast
given
unto
thy
people
for
an
inheritance
6
28
if
there
be
dearth
in
the
land
if
there
be
pestilence
if
there
be
blasting
or
mildew
locusts
or
caterpillers
if
their
enemies
besiege
them
in
the
cities
of
their
land
whatsoever
sore
or
whatsoever
sickness
there
be
6
29
then
what
prayer
or
what
supplication
soever
shall
be
made
of
any
man
or
of
all
thy
people
israel
when
every
one
shall
know
his
own
sore
and
his
own
grief
and
shall
spread
forth
his
hands
in
this
house
6
30
then
hear
thou
from
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
forgive
and
render
unto
every
man
according
unto
all
his
ways
whose
heart
thou
knowest
(for
thou
only
knowest
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
)
6
31
that
they
may
fear
thee
to
walk
in
thy
ways
so
long
as
they
live
in
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
6
32
moreover
concerning
the
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
people
israel
but
is
come
from
a
far
country
for
thy
great
name’s
sake
and
thy
mighty
hand
and
thy
stretched
out
arm
if
they
come
and
pray
in
this
house
6
33
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
even
from
thy
dwelling
place
and
do
according
to
all
that
the
stranger
calleth
to
thee
for
that
all
people
of
the
earth
may
know
thy
name
and
fear
thee
as
doth
thy
people
israel
and
may
know
that
this
house
which
i
have
built
is
called
by
thy
name
6
34
if
thy
people
go
out
to
war
against
their
enemies
by
the
way
that
thou
shalt
send
them
and
they
pray
unto
thee
toward
this
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
6
35
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
and
maintain
their
cause
6
36
if
they
sin
against
thee
(for
there
is
no
man
which
sinneth
not
)
and
thou
be
angry
with
them
and
deliver
them
over
before
their
enemies
and
they
carry
them
away
captives
unto
a
land
far
off
or
near
6
37
yet
if
they
bethink
themselves
in
the
land
whither
they
are
carried
captive
and
turn
and
pray
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
their
captivity
saying
we
have
sinned
we
have
done
amiss
and
have
dealt
wickedly
6
38
if
they
return
to
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
captivity
whither
they
have
carried
them
captives
and
pray
toward
their
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
and
toward
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
toward
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
6
39
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
even
from
thy
dwelling
place
their
prayer
and
their
supplications
and
maintain
their
cause
and
forgive
thy
people
which
have
sinned
against
thee
6
40
now
my
god
let
i
beseech
thee
thine
eyes
be
open
and
let
thine
ears
be
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place
6
41
now
therefore
arise
o
lord
god
into
thy
resting
place
thou
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength
let
thy
priests
o
lord
god
be
clothed
with
salvation
and
let
thy
saints
rejoice
in
goodness
6
42
o
lord
god
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed
remember
the
mercies
of
david
thy
servant
7
1
now
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
the
fire
came
down
from
heaven
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifices
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
house
7
2
and
the
priests
could
not
enter
into
the
house
of
the
lord
because
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
lord’s
house
7
3
and
when
all
the
children
of
israel
saw
how
the
fire
came
down
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
upon
the
house
they
bowed
themselves
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
upon
the
pavement
and
worshipped
and
praised
the
lord
saying
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
7
4
then
the
king
and
all
the
people
offered
sacrifices
before
the
lord
7
5
and
king
solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
twenty
and
two
thousand
oxen
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep
so
the
king
and
all
the
people
dedicated
the
house
of
god
7
6
and
the
priests
waited
on
their
offices
the
levites
also
with
instruments
of
musick
of
the
lord
which
david
the
king
had
made
to
praise
the
lord
because
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
when
david
praised
by
their
ministry
and
the
priests
sounded
trumpets
before
them
and
all
israel
stood
7
7
moreover
solomon
hallowed
the
middle
of
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
of
the
lord
for
there
he
offered
burnt
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
because
the
brasen
altar
which
solomon
had
made
was
not
able
to
receive
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
7
8
also
at
the
same
time
solomon
kept
the
feast
seven
days
and
all
israel
with
him
a
very
great
congregation
from
the
entering
in
of
hamath
unto
the
river
of
egypt
7
9
and
in
the
eighth
day
they
made
a
solemn
assembly
for
they
kept
the
dedication
of
the
altar
seven
days
and
the
feast
seven
days
7
10
and
on
the
three
and
twentieth
day
of
the
seventh
month
he
sent
the
people
away
into
their
tents
glad
and
merry
in
heart
for
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
shewed
unto
david
and
to
solomon
and
to
israel
his
people
7
11
thus
solomon
finished
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king’s
house
and
all
that
came
into
solomon’s
heart
to
make
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
his
own
house
he
prosperously
effected
7
12
and
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
by
night
and
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
have
chosen
this
place
to
myself
for
an
house
of
sacrifice
7
13
if
i
shut
up
heaven
that
there
be
no
rain
or
if
i
command
the
locusts
to
devour
the
land
or
if
i
send
pestilence
among
my
people
7
14
if
my
people
which
are
called
by
my
name
shall
humble
themselves
and
pray
and
seek
my
face
and
turn
from
their
wicked
ways
then
will
i
hear
from
heaven
and
will
forgive
their
sin
and
will
heal
their
land
7
15
now
mine
eyes
shall
be
open
and
mine
ears
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place
7
16
for
now
have
i
chosen
and
sanctified
this
house
that
my
name
may
be
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
7
17
and
as
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
david
thy
father
walked
and
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
shalt
observe
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
7
18
then
will
i
stablish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
according
as
i
have
covenanted
with
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
to
be
ruler
in
israel
7
19
but
if
ye
turn
away
and
forsake
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
which
i
have
set
before
you
and
shall
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
7
20
then
will
i
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
out
of
my
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
sanctified
for
my
name
will
i
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
will
make
it
to
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
nations
7
21
and
this
house
which
is
high
shall
be
an
astonishment
to
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
so
that
he
shall
say
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
unto
this
house
7
22
and
it
shall
be
answered
because
they
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
laid
hold
on
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
he
brought
all
this
evil
upon
them
8
1
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
wherein
solomon
had
built
the
house
of
the
lord
and
his
own
house
8
2
that
the
cities
which
huram
had
restored
to
solomon
solomon
built
them
and
caused
the
children
of
israel
to
dwell
there
8
3
and
solomon
went
to
hamathzobah
and
prevailed
against
it
8
4
and
he
built
tadmor
in
the
wilderness
and
all
the
store
cities
which
he
built
in
hamath
8
5
also
he
built
bethhoron
the
upper
and
bethhoron
the
nether
fenced
cities
with
walls
gates
and
bars
8
6
and
baalath
and
all
the
store
cities
that
solomon
had
and
all
the
chariot
cities
and
the
cities
of
the
horsemen
and
all
that
solomon
desired
to
build
in
jerusalem
and
in
lebanon
and
throughout
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
8
7
as
for
all
the
people
that
were
left
of
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
which
were
not
of
israel
8
8
but
of
their
children
who
were
left
after
them
in
the
land
whom
the
children
of
israel
consumed
not
them
did
solomon
make
to
pay
tribute
until
this
day
8
9
but
of
the
children
of
israel
did
solomon
make
no
servants
for
his
work
but
they
were
men
of
war
and
chief
of
his
captains
and
captains
of
his
chariots
and
horsemen
8
10
and
these
were
the
chief
of
king
solomon’s
officers
even
two
hundred
and
fifty
that
bare
rule
over
the
people
8
11
and
solomon
brought
up
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
out
of
the
city
of
david
unto
the
house
that
he
had
built
for
her
for
he
said
my
wife
shall
not
dwell
in
the
house
of
david
king
of
israel
because
the
places
are
holy
whereunto
the
ark
of
the
lord
hath
come
8
12
then
solomon
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
on
the
altar
of
the
lord
which
he
had
built
before
the
porch
8
13
even
after
a
certain
rate
every
day
offering
according
to
the
commandment
of
moses
on
the
sabbaths
and
on
the
new
moons
and
on
the
solemn
feasts
three
times
in
the
year
even
in
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
and
in
the
feast
of
weeks
and
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles
8
14
and
he
appointed
according
to
the
order
of
david
his
father
the
courses
of
the
priests
to
their
service
and
the
levites
to
their
charges
to
praise
and
minister
before
the
priests
as
the
duty
of
every
day
required
the
porters
also
by
their
courses
at
every
gate
for
so
had
david
the
man
of
god
commanded
8
15
and
they
departed
not
from
the
commandment
of
the
king
unto
the
priests
and
levites
concerning
any
matter
or
concerning
the
treasures
8
16
now
all
the
work
of
solomon
was
prepared
unto
the
day
of
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
until
it
was
finished
so
the
house
of
the
lord
was
perfected
8
17
then
went
solomon
to
eziongeber
and
to
eloth
at
the
sea
side
in
the
land
of
edom
8
18
and
huram
sent
him
by
the
hands
of
his
servants
ships
and
servants
that
had
knowledge
of
the
sea
and
they
went
with
the
servants
of
solomon
to
ophir
and
took
thence
four
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
gold
and
brought
them
to
king
solomon
9
1
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
heard
of
the
fame
of
solomon
she
came
to
prove
solomon
with
hard
questions
at
jerusalem
with
a
very
great
company
and
camels
that
bare
spices
and
gold
in
abundance
and
precious
stones
and
when
she
was
come
to
solomon
she
communed
with
him
of
all
that
was
in
her
heart
9
2
and
solomon
told
her
all
her
questions
and
there
was
nothing
hid
from
solomon
which
he
told
her
not
9
3
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
had
seen
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
the
house
that
he
had
built
9
4
and
the
meat
of
his
table
and
the
sitting
of
his
servants
and
the
attendance
of
his
ministers
and
their
apparel
his
cupbearers
also
and
their
apparel
and
his
ascent
by
which
he
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her
9
5
and
she
said
to
the
king
it
was
a
true
report
which
i
heard
in
mine
own
land
of
thine
acts
and
of
thy
wisdom
9
6
howbeit
i
believed
not
their
words
until
i
came
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
it
and
behold
the
one
half
of
the
greatness
of
thy
wisdom
was
not
told
me
for
thou
exceedest
the
fame
that
i
heard
9
7
happy
are
thy
men
and
happy
are
these
thy
servants
which
stand
continually
before
thee
and
hear
thy
wisdom
9
8
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
delighted
in
thee
to
set
thee
on
his
throne
to
be
king
for
the
lord
thy
god
because
thy
god
loved
israel
to
establish
them
for
ever
therefore
made
he
thee
king
over
them
to
do
judgment
and
justice
9
9
and
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of
gold
and
of
spices
great
abundance
and
precious
stones
neither
was
there
any
such
spice
as
the
queen
of
sheba
gave
king
solomon
9
10
and
the
servants
also
of
huram
and
the
servants
of
solomon
which
brought
gold
from
ophir
brought
algum
trees
and
precious
stones
9
11
and
the
king
made
of
the
algum
trees
terraces
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
to
the
king’s
palace
and
harps
and

gave
to
the
queen

all
her
desire
whatsoever
she
asked
beside
that

9
17
moreover
the

made
a

and
overlaid
it
with

9
21
for

three
years
once
came

9
22
and
king
solomon
passed
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
in
riches
and
wisdom
9
23
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
sought
the
presence
of
solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
that
god
had
put
in
his
heart
9
24
and
they
brought

and
vessels
of
gold
and
raiment
harness
and
spices
horses
and

kings
from
the
river
even
unto
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
to
the
border
of

9
27
and
the

and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
low
plains
in
abundance
9
28
and
they
brought
unto
solomon
horses
out
of
egypt
and
out
of
all
lands
9
29
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
solomon
first
and
last
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
in
the
prophecy
of
ahijah
the
shilonite
and
in
the
visions
of
iddo
the
seer
against
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
9
30
and
solomon
reigned
in
jerusalem
over
all
israel
forty
years
9
31
and
solomon
slept
with
his
fathers
and
he
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
10
1
and
rehoboam
went
to
shechem
for
to
shechem
were
all
israel
come
to
make
him
king
10
2
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
was
in
egypt
whither
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
solomon
the
king
heard
it
that
jeroboam
returned
out
of
egypt
10
3
and
they
sent
and
called
him
so
jeroboam
and
all
israel
came
and
spake
to
rehoboam
saying
10
4
thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous
now
therefore
ease
thou
somewhat
the
grievous
servitude
of
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
that
he
put
upon
us
and
we
will
serve
thee
10
5
and
he
said
unto
them
come
again
unto
me
after
three
days
and
the
people
departed
10
6
and
king
rehoboam
took
counsel
with
the
old
men
that
had
stood
before
solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
lived
saying
what
counsel
give
ye
me
to
return
answer
to
this
people
10
7
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
if
thou
be
kind
to
this
people
and
please
them
and
speak
good
words
to
them
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
ever
10
8
but
he
forsook
the
counsel
which
the
old
men
gave
him
and
took
counsel
with
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
that
stood
before
him
10
9
and
he
said
unto
them
what
advice
give
ye
that
we
may
return
answer
to
this
people
which
have
spoken
to
me
saying
ease
somewhat
the
yoke
that
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
10
10
and
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
spake
unto
him
saying
thus
shalt
thou
answer
the
people
that
spake
unto
thee
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
make
thou
it
somewhat
lighter
for
us
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
my
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father’s
loins
10
11
for
whereas
my
father
put
a
heavy
yoke
upon
you
i
will
put
more
to
your
yoke
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
10
12
so
jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
rehoboam
on
the
third
day
as
the
king
bade
saying
come
again
to
me
on
the
third
day
10
13
and
the
king
answered
them
roughly
and
king
rehoboam
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
men
10
14
and
answered
them
after
the
advice
of
the
young
men
saying
my
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
but
i
will
add
thereto
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
10
15
so
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
for
the
cause
was
of
god
that
the
lord
might
perform
his
word
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
ahijah
the
shilonite
to
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
10
16
and
when
all
israel
saw
that
the
king
would
not
hearken
unto
them
the
people
answered
the
king
saying
what
portion
have
we
in
david
and
we
have
none
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
every
man
to
your
tents
o
israel
and
now
david
see
to
thine
own
house
so
all
israel
went
to
their
tents
10
17
but
as
for
the
children
of
israel
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
rehoboam
reigned
over
them
10
18
then
king
rehoboam
sent
hadoram
that
was
over
the
tribute
and
the
children
of
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
but
king
rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
chariot
to
flee
to
jerusalem
10
19
and
israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
david
unto
this
day
11
1
and
when
rehoboam
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
gathered
of
the
house
of
judah
and
benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men
which
were
warriors
to
fight
against
israel
that
he
might
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
rehoboam
11
2
but
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
shemaiah
the
man
of
god
saying
11
3
speak
unto
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
king
of
judah
and
to
all
israel
in
judah
and
benjamin
saying
11
4
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
go
up
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
return
every
man
to
his
house
for
this
thing
is
done
of
me
and
they
obeyed
the
words
of
the
lord
and
returned
from
going
against
jeroboam
11
5
and
rehoboam
dwelt
in
jerusalem
and
built
cities
for
defence
in
judah
11
6
he
built
even
bethlehem
and
etam
and
tekoa
11
7
and
bethzur
and
shoco
and
adullam
11
8
and
gath
and
mareshah
and
ziph
11
9
and
adoraim
and
lachish
and
azekah
11
10
and
zorah
and
aijalon
and
hebron
which
are
in
judah
and
in
benjamin
fenced
cities
11
11
and
he
fortified
the
strong
holds
and
put
captains
in
them
and
store
of
victual
and
of
oil
and
wine
11
12
and
in
every
several
city
he
put
shields
and
spears
and
made
them
exceeding
strong
having
judah
and
benjamin
on
his
side
11
13
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
that
were
in
all
israel
resorted
to
him
out
of
all
their
coasts
11
14
for
the
levites
left
their
suburbs
and
their
possession
and
came
to
judah
and
jerusalem
for
jeroboam
and
his
sons
had
cast
them
off
from
executing
the
priest’s
office
unto
the
lord
11
15
and
he
ordained
him
priests
for
the
high
places
and
for
the
devils
and
for
the
calves
which
he
had
made
11
16
and
after
them
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
such
as
set
their
hearts
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
israel
came
to
jerusalem
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
11
17
so
they
strengthened
the
kingdom
of
judah
and
made
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
strong
three
years
for
three
years
they
walked
in
the
way
of
david
and
solomon
11
18
and
rehoboam
took
him
mahalath
the
daughter
of
jerimoth
the
son
of
david
to
wife
and
abihail
the
daughter
of
eliab
the
son
of
jesse
11
19
which
bare
him
children
jeush
and
shamariah
and
zaham
11
20
and
after
her
he
took
maachah
the
daughter
of
absalom
which
bare
him
abijah
and
attai
and
ziza
and
shelomith
11
21
and
rehoboam
loved
maachah
the
daughter
of
absalom
above
all
his
wives
and
his
concubines
(for
he
took
eighteen
wives
and
threescore
concubines
and
begat
twenty
and
eight
sons
and
threescore
daughters
)
11
22
and
rehoboam
made
abijah
the
son
of
maachah
the
chief
to
be
ruler
among
his
brethren
for
he
thought
to
make
him
king
11
23
and
he
dealt
wisely
and
dispersed
of
all
his
children
throughout
all
the
countries
of
judah
and
benjamin
unto
every
fenced
city
and
he
gave
them
victual
in
abundance
and
he
desired
many
wives
12
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
rehoboam
had
established
the
kingdom
and
had
strengthened
himself
he
forsook
the
law
of
the
lord
and
all
israel
with
him
12
2
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
rehoboam
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
because
they
had
transgressed
against
the
lord
12
3
with
twelve
hundred
chariots
and
threescore
thousand
horsemen
and
the
people
were
without
number
that
came
with
him
out
of
egypt
the
lubims
the
sukkiims
and
the
ethiopians
12
4
and
he
took
the
fenced
cities
which
pertained
to
judah
and
came
to
jerusalem
12
5
then
came
shemaiah
the
prophet
to
rehoboam
and
to
the
princes
of
judah
that
were
gathered
together
to
jerusalem
because
of
shishak
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
therefore
have
i
also
left
you
in
the
hand
of
shishak
12
6
whereupon
the
princes
of
israel
and
the
king
humbled
themselves
and
they
said
the
lord
is
righteous
12
7
and
when
the
lord
saw
that
they
humbled
themselves
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
shemaiah
saying
they
have
humbled
themselves
therefore
i
will
not
destroy
them
but
i
will
grant
them
some
deliverance
and
my
wrath
shall
not
be
poured
out
upon
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
shishak
12
8
nevertheless
they
shall
be
his
servants
that
they
may
know
my
service
and
the
service
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries
12
9
so
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
and
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king’s
house
he
took
all
he
carried
away
also
the
shields
of
gold
which
solomon
had
made
12
10
instead
of
which
king
rehoboam
made
shields
of
brass
and
committed
them
to
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
that
kept
the
entrance
of
the
king’s
house
12
11
and
when
the
king
entered
into
the
house
of
the
lord
the
guard
came
and
fetched
them
and
brought
them
again
into
the
guard
chamber
12
12
and
when
he
humbled
himself
the
wrath
of
the
lord
turned
from
him
that
he
would
not
destroy
him
altogether
and
also
in
judah
things
went
well
12
13
so
king
rehoboam
strengthened
himself
in
jerusalem
and
reigned
for
rehoboam
was
one
and
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
the
lord
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
put
his
name
there
and
his
mother’s
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
12
14
and
he
did
evil
because
he
prepared
not
his
heart
to
seek
the
lord
12
15
now
the
acts
of
rehoboam
first
and
last
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
shemaiah
the
prophet
and
of
iddo
the
seer
concerning
genealogies
and
there
were
wars
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
continually
12
16
and
rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
and
abijah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
13
1
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
jeroboam
began
abijah
to
reign
over
judah
13
2
he
reigned
three
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
michaiah
the
daughter
of
uriel
of
gibeah
and
there
was
war
between
abijah
and
jeroboam
13
3
and
abijah
set
the
battle
in
array
with
an
army
of
valiant
men
of
war
even
four
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
jeroboam
also
set
the
battle
in
array
against
him
with
eight
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
being
mighty
men
of
valour
13
4
and
abijah
stood
up
upon
mount
zemaraim
which
is
in
mount
ephraim
and
said
hear
me
thou
jeroboam
and
all
israel
13
5
ought
ye
not
to
know
that
the
lord
god
of
israel
gave
the
kingdom
over
israel
to
david
for
ever
even
to
him
and
to
his
sons
by
a
covenant
of
salt
13
6
yet
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
the
servant
of
solomon
the
son
of
david
is
risen
up
and
hath
rebelled
against
his
lord
13
7
and
there
are
gathered
unto
him
vain
men
the
children
of
belial
and
have
strengthened
themselves
against
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
when
rehoboam
was
young
and
tenderhearted
and
could
not
withstand
them
13
8
and
now
ye
think
to
withstand
the
kingdom
of
the
lord
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
david
and
ye
be
a
great
multitude
and
there
are
with
you
golden
calves
which
jeroboam
made
you
for
gods
13
9
have
ye
not
cast
out
the
priests
of
the
lord
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
and
have
made
you
priests
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
so
that
whosoever
cometh
to
consecrate
himself
with
a
young
bullock
and
seven
rams
the
same
may
be
a
priest
of
them
that
are
no
gods
13
10
but
as
for
us
the
lord
is
our
god
and
we
have
not
forsaken
him
and
the
priests
which
minister
unto
the
lord
are
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
wait
upon
their
business
13
11
and
they
burn
unto
the
lord
every
morning
and
every
evening
burnt
sacrifices
and
sweet
incense
the
shewbread
also
set
they
in
order
upon
the
pure
table
and
the
candlestick
of
gold
with
the
lamps
thereof
to
burn
every
evening
for
we
keep
the
charge
of
the
lord
our
god
but
ye
have
forsaken
him
13
12
and
behold
god
himself
is
with
us
for
our
captain
and
his
priests
with
sounding
trumpets
to
cry
alarm
against
you
o
children
of
israel
fight
ye
not
against
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
for
ye
shall
not
prosper
13
13
but
jeroboam
caused
an
ambushment
to
come
about
behind
them
so
they
were
before
judah
and
the
ambushment
was
behind
them
13
14
and
when
judah
looked
back
behold
the
battle
was
before
and
behind
and
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
the
priests
sounded
with
the
trumpets
13
15
then
the
men
of
judah
gave
a
shout
and
as
the
men
of
judah
shouted
it
came
to
pass
that
god
smote
jeroboam
and
all
israel
before
abijah
and
judah
13
16
and
the
children
of
israel
fled
before
judah
and
god
delivered
them
into
their
hand
13
17
and
abijah
and
his
people
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
so
there
fell
down
slain
of
israel
five
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
13
18
thus
the
children
of
israel
were
brought
under
at
that
time
and
the
children
of
judah
prevailed
because
they
relied
upon
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
13
19
and
abijah
pursued
after
jeroboam
and
took
cities
from
him
bethel
with
the
towns
thereof
and
jeshanah
with
the
towns
thereof
and
ephraim
with
the
towns
thereof
13
20
neither
did
jeroboam
recover
strength
again
in
the
days
of
abijah
and
the
lord
struck
him
and
he
died
13
21
but
abijah
waxed
mighty
and
married
fourteen
wives
and
begat
twenty
and
two
sons
and
sixteen
daughters
13
22
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
abijah
and
his
ways
and
his
sayings
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
prophet
iddo
14
1
so
abijah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
his
days
the
land
was
quiet
ten
years
14
2
and
asa
did
that
which
was
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
his
god
14
3
for
he
took
away
the
altars
of
the
strange
gods
and
the
high
places
and
brake
down
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
14
4
and
commanded
judah
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
to
do
the
law
and
the
commandment
14
5
also
he
took
away
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
the
high
places
and
the
images
and
the
kingdom
was
quiet
before
him
14
6
and
he
built
fenced
cities
in
judah
for
the
land
had
rest
and
he
had
no
war
in
those
years
because
the
lord
had
given
him
rest
14
7
therefore
he
said
unto
judah
let
us
build
these
cities
and
make
about
them
walls
and
towers
gates
and
bars
while
the
land
is
yet
before
us
because
we
have
sought
the
lord
our
god
we
have
sought
him
and
he
hath
given
us
rest
on
every
side
so
they
built
and
prospered
14
8
and
asa
had
an
army
of
men
that
bare
targets
and
spears
out
of
judah
three
hundred
thousand
and
out
of
benjamin
that
bare
shields
and
drew
bows
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
all
these
were
mighty
men
of
valour
14
9
and
there
came
out
against
them
zerah
the
ethiopian
with
an
host
of
a
thousand
thousand
and
three
hundred
chariots
and
came
unto
mareshah
14
10
then
asa
went
out
against
him
and
they
set
the
battle
in
array
in
the
valley
of
zephathah
at
mareshah
14
11
and
asa
cried
unto
the
lord
his
god
and
said
lord
it
is
nothing
with
thee
to
help
whether
with
many
or
with
them
that
have
no
power
help
us
o
lord
our
god
for
we
rest
on
thee
and
in
thy
name
we
go
against
this
multitude
o
lord
thou
art
our
god
let
no
man
prevail
against
thee
14
12
so
the
lord
smote
the
ethiopians
before
asa
and
before
judah
and
the
ethiopians
fled
14
13
and
asa
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
pursued
them
unto
gerar
and
the
ethiopians
were
overthrown
that
they
could
not
recover
themselves
for
they
were
destroyed
before
the
lord
and
before
his
host
and
they
carried
away
very
much
spoil
14
14
and
they
smote
all
the
cities
round
about
gerar
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
they
spoiled
all
the
cities
for
there
was
exceeding
much
spoil
in
them
14
15
they
smote
also
the
tents
of
cattle
and
carried
away
sheep
and
camels
in
abundance
and
returned
to
jerusalem
15
1
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
azariah
the
son
of
oded
15
2
and
he
went
out
to
meet
asa
and
said
unto
him
hear
ye
me
asa
and
all
judah
and
benjamin
the
lord
is
with
you
while
ye
be
with
him
and
if
ye
seek
him
he
will
be
found
of
you
but
if
ye
forsake
him
he
will
forsake
you
15
3
now
for
a
long
season
israel
hath
been
without
the
true
god
and
without
a
teaching
priest
and
without
law
15
4
but
when
they
in
their
trouble
did
turn
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
sought
him
he
was
found
of
them
15
5
and
in
those
times
there
was
no
peace
to
him
that
went
out
nor
to
him
that
came
in
but
great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries
15
6
and
nation
was
destroyed
of
nation
and
city
of
city
for
god
did
vex
them
with
all
adversity
15
7
be
ye
strong
therefore
and
let
not
your
hands
be
weak
for
your
work
shall
be
rewarded
15
8
and
when
asa
heard
these
words
and
the
prophecy
of
oded
the
prophet
he
took
courage
and
put
away
the
abominable
idols
out
of
all
the
land
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
out
of
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
from
mount
ephraim
and
renewed
the
altar
of
the
lord
that
was
before
the
porch
of
the
lord
15
9
and
he
gathered
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
the
strangers
with
them
out
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
and
out
of
simeon
for
they
fell
to
him
out
of
israel
in
abundance
when
they
saw
that
the
lord
his
god
was
with
him
15
10
so
they
gathered
themselves
together
at
jerusalem
in
the
third
month
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
15
11
and
they
offered
unto
the
lord
the
same
time
of
the
spoil
which
they
had
brought
seven
hundred
oxen
and
seven
thousand
sheep
15
12
and
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
15
13
that
whosoever
would
not
seek
the
lord
god
of
israel
should
be
put
to
death
whether
small
or
great
whether
man
or
woman
15
14
and
they
sware
unto
the
lord
with
a
loud
voice
and
with
shouting
and
with
trumpets
and
with
cornets
15
15
and
all
judah
rejoiced
at
the
oath
for
they
had
sworn
with
all
their
heart
and
sought
him
with
their
whole
desire
and
he
was
found
of
them
and
the
lord
gave
them
rest
round
about
15
16
and
also
concerning
maachah
the
mother
of
asa
the
king
he
removed
her
from
being
queen
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove
and
asa
cut
down
her
idol
and
stamped
it
and
burnt
it
at
the
brook
kidron
15
17
but
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
out
of
israel
nevertheless
the
heart
of
asa
was
perfect
all
his
days
15
18
and
he
brought
into
the
house
of
god
the
things
that
his
father
had
dedicated
and
that
he
himself
had
dedicated
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
15
19
and
there
was
no
more
war
unto
the
five
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
16
1
in
the
six
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
baasha
king
of
israel
came
up
against
judah
and
built
ramah
to
the
intent
that
he
might
let
none
go
out
or
come
in
to
asa
king
of
judah
16
2
then
asa
brought
out
silver
and
gold
out
of
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
of
the
king’s
house
and
sent
to
benhadad
king
of
syria
that
dwelt
at
damascus
saying
16
3
there
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee
as
there
was
between
my
father
and
thy
father
behold
i
have
sent
thee
silver
and
gold
go
break
thy
league
with
baasha
king
of
israel
that
he
may
depart
from
me
16
4
and
benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
asa
and
sent
the
captains
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
israel
and
they
smote
ijon
and
dan
and
abelmaim
and
all
the
store
cities
of
naphtali
16
5
and
it
came
to
pass
when
baasha
heard
it
that
he
left
off
building
of
ramah
and
let
his
work
cease
16
6
then
asa
the
king
took
all
judah
and
they
carried
away
the
stones
of
ramah
and
the
timber
thereof
wherewith
baasha
was
building
and
he
built
therewith
geba
and
mizpah
16
7
and
at
that
time
hanani
the
seer
came
to
asa
king
of
judah
and
said
unto
him
because
thou
hast
relied
on
the
king
of
syria
and
not
relied
on
the
lord
thy
god
therefore
is
the
host
of
the
king
of
syria
escaped
out
of
thine
hand
16
8
were
not
the
ethiopians
and
the
lubims
a
huge
host
with
very
many
chariots
and
horsemen
yet
because
thou
didst
rely
on
the
lord
he
delivered
them
into
thine
hand
16
9
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
run
to
and
fro
throughout
the
whole
earth
to
shew
himself
strong
in
the
behalf
of
them
whose
heart
is
perfect
toward
him
herein
thou
hast
done
foolishly
therefore
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
have
wars
16
10
then
asa
was
wroth
with
the
seer
and
put
him
in
a
prison
house
for
he
was
in
a
rage
with
him
because
of
this
thing
and
asa
oppressed
some
of
the
people
the
same
time
16
11
and
behold
the
acts
of
asa
first
and
last
lo
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
16
12
and
asa
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
his
reign
was
diseased
in
his
feet
until
his
disease
was
exceeding
great
yet
in
his
disease
he
sought
not
to
the
lord
but
to
the
physicians
16
13
and
asa
slept
with
his
fathers
and
died
in
the
one
and
fortieth
year
of
his
reign
16
14
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own
sepulchres
which
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
city
of
david
and
laid
him
in
the
bed
which
was
filled
with
sweet
odours
and
divers
kinds
of
spices
prepared
by
the
apothecaries’
art
and
they
made
a
very
great
burning
for
him
17
1
and
jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
strengthened
himself
against
israel
17
2
and
he
placed
forces
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
and
set
garrisons
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
of
ephraim
which
asa
his
father
had
taken
17
3
and
the
lord
was
with
jehoshaphat
because
he
walked
in
the
first
ways
of
his
father
david
and
sought
not
unto
baalim
17
4
but
sought
to
the
lord
god
of
his
father
and
walked
in
his
commandments
and
not
after
the
doings
of
israel
17
5
therefore
the
lord
stablished
the
kingdom
in
his
hand
and
all
judah
brought
to
jehoshaphat
presents
and
he
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance
17
6
and
his
heart
was
lifted
up
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
moreover
he
took
away
the
high
places
and
groves
out
of
judah
17
7
also
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
sent
to
his
princes
even
to
benhail
and
to
obadiah
and
to
zechariah
and
to
nethaneel
and
to
michaiah
to
teach
in
the
cities
of
judah
17
8
and
with
them
he
sent
levites
even
shemaiah
and
nethaniah
and
zebadiah
and
asahel
and
shemiramoth
and
jehonathan
and
adonijah
and
tobijah
and
tobadonijah
levites
and
with
them
elishama
and
jehoram
priests
17
9
and
they
taught
in
judah
and
had
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
with
them
and
went
about
throughout
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
taught
the
people
17
10
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
fell
upon
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
lands
that
were
round
about
judah
so
that
they
made
no
war
against
jehoshaphat
17
11
also
some
of
the
philistines
brought
jehoshaphat
presents
and
tribute
silver
and
the
arabians
brought
him
flocks
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
rams
and
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
he
goats
17
12
and
jehoshaphat
waxed
great
exceedingly
and
he
built
in
judah
castles
and
cities
of
store
17
13
and
he
had
much
business
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
men
of
war
mighty
men
of
valour
were
in
jerusalem
17
14
and
these
are
the
numbers
of
them
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
of
judah
the
captains
of
thousands
adnah
the
chief
and
with
him
mighty
men
of
valour
three
hundred
thousand
17
15
and
next
to
him
was
jehohanan
the
captain
and
with
him
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
17
16
and
next
him
was
amasiah
the
son
of
zichri
who
willingly
offered
himself
unto
the
lord
and
with
him
two
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
17
17
and
of
benjamin
eliada
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
with
him
armed
men
with
bow
and
shield
two
hundred
thousand
17
18
and
next
him
was
jehozabad
and
with
him
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
ready
prepared
for
the
war
17
19
these
waited
on
the
king
beside
those
whom
the
king
put
in
the
fenced
cities
throughout
all
judah
18
1
now
jehoshaphat
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance
and
joined
affinity
with
ahab
18
2
and
after
certain
years
he
went
down
to
ahab
to
samaria
and
ahab
killed
sheep
and
oxen
for
him
in
abundance
and
for
the
people
that
he
had
with
him
and
persuaded
him
to
go
up
with
him
to
ramothgilead
18
3
and
ahab
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
ramothgilead
and
he
answered
him
i
am
as
thou
art
and
my
people
as
thy
people
and
we
will
be
with
thee
in
the
war
18
4
and
jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
enquire
i
pray
thee
at
the
word
of
the
lord
to
day
18
5
therefore
the
king
of
israel
gathered
together
of
prophets
four
hundred
men
and
said
unto
them
shall
we
go
to
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
they
said
go
up
for
god
will
deliver
it
into
the
king’s
hand
18
6
but
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
besides
that
we
might
enquire
of
him
18
7
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
there
is
yet
one
man
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
but
i
hate
him
for
he
never
prophesied
good
unto
me
but
always
evil
the
same
is
micaiah
the
son
of
imla
and
jehoshaphat
said
let
not
the
king
say
so
18
8
and
the
king
of
israel
called
for
one
of
his
officers
and
said
fetch
quickly
micaiah
the
son
of
imla
18
9
and
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
sat
either
of
them
on
his
throne
clothed
in
their
robes
and
they
sat
in
a
void
place
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
samaria
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them
18
10
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
had
made
him
horns
of
iron
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
with
these
thou
shalt
push
syria
until
they
be
consumed
18
11
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so
saying
go
up
to
ramothgilead
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
18
12
and
the
messenger
that
went
to
call
micaiah
spake
to
him
saying
behold
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
to
the
king
with
one
assent
let
thy
word
therefore
i
pray
thee
be
like
one
of
theirs
and
speak
thou
good
18
13
and
micaiah
said
as
the
lord
liveth
even
what
my
god
saith
that
will
i
speak
18
14
and
when
he
was
come
to
the
king
the
king
said
unto
him
micaiah
shall
we
go
to
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
he
said
go
ye
up
and
prosper
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand
18
15
and
the
king
said
to
him
how
many
times
shall
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
say
nothing
but
the
truth
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
lord
18
16
then
he
said
i
did
see
all
israel
scattered
upon
the
mountains
as
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
and
the
lord
said
these
have
no
master
let
them
return
therefore
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace
18
17
and
the
king
of
israel
said
to
jehoshaphat
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
not
prophesy
good
unto
me
but
evil
18
18
again
he
said
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
i
saw
the
lord
sitting
upon
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
18
19
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
entice
ahab
king
of
israel
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
ramothgilead
and
one
spake
saying
after
this
manner
and
another
saying
after
that
manner
18
20
then
there
came
out
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
entice
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
18
21
and
he
said
i
will
go
out
and
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
the
lord
said
thou
shalt
entice
him
and
thou
shalt
also
prevail
go
out
and
do
even
so
18
22
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
against
thee
18
23
then
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
came
near
and
smote
micaiah
upon
the
cheek
and
said
which
way
went
the
spirit
of
the
lord
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee
18
24
and
micaiah
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
on
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself
18
25
then
the
king
of
israel
said
take
ye
micaiah
and
carry
him
back
to
amon
the
governor
of
the
city
and
to
joash
the
king’s
son
18
26
and
say
thus
saith
the
king
put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction
until
i
return
in
peace
18
27
and
micaiah
said
if
thou
certainly
return
in
peace
then
hath
not
the
lord
spoken
by
me
and
he
said
hearken
all
ye
people
18
28
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
went
up
to
ramothgilead
18
29
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
i
will
disguise
myself
and
i
will
go
to
the
battle
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes
so
the
king
of
israel
disguised
himself
and
they
went
to
the
battle
18
30
now
the
king
of
syria
had
commanded
the
captains
of
the
chariots
that
were
with
him
saying
fight
ye
not
with
small
or
great
save
only
with
the
king
of
israel
18
31
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
jehoshaphat
that
they
said
it
is
the
king
of
israel
therefore
they
compassed
about
him
to
fight
but
jehoshaphat
cried
out
and
the
lord
helped
him
and
god
moved
them
to
depart
from
him
18
32
for
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
israel
they
turned
back
again
from
pursuing
him
18
33
and
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture
and
smote
the
king
of
israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness
therefore
he
said
to
his
chariot
man
turn
thine
hand
that
thou
mayest
carry
me
out
of
the
host
for
i
am
wounded
18
34
and
the
battle
increased
that
day
howbeit
the
king
of
israel
stayed
himself
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
syrians
until
the
even
and
about
the
time
of
the
sun
going
down
he
died
19
1
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
returned
to
his
house
in
peace
to
jerusalem
19
2
and
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
the
seer
went
out
to
meet
him
and
said
to
king
jehoshaphat
shouldest
thou
help
the
ungodly
and
love
them
that
hate
the
lord
therefore
is
wrath
upon
thee
from
before
the
lord
19
3
nevertheless
there
are
good
things
found
in
thee
in
that
thou
hast
taken
away
the
groves
out
of
the
land
and
hast
prepared
thine
heart
to
seek
god
19
4
and
jehoshaphat
dwelt
at
jerusalem
and
he
went
out
again
through
the
people
from
beersheba
to
mount
ephraim
and
brought
them
back
unto
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
19
5
and
he
set
judges
in
the
land
throughout
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
city
by
city
19
6
and
said
to
the
judges
take
heed
what
ye
do
for
ye
judge
not
for
man
but
for
the
lord
who
is
with
you
in
the
judgment
19
7
wherefore
now
let
the
fear
of
the
lord
be
upon
you
take
heed
and
do
it
for
there
is
no
iniquity
with
the
lord
our
god
nor
respect
of
persons
nor
taking
of
gifts
19
8
moreover
in
jerusalem
did
jehoshaphat
set
of
the
levites
and
of
the
priests
and
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
for
the
judgment
of
the
lord
and
for
controversies
when
they
returned
to
jerusalem
19
9
and
he
charged
them
saying
thus
shall
ye
do
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
faithfully
and
with
a
perfect
heart
19
10
and
what
cause
soever
shall
come
to
you
of
your
brethren
that
dwell
in
your
cities
between
blood
and
blood
between
law
and
commandment
statutes
and
judgments
ye
shall
even
warn
them
that
they
trespass
not
against
the
lord
and
so
wrath
come
upon
you
and
upon
your
brethren
this
do
and
ye
shall
not
trespass
19
11
and
behold
amariah
the
chief
priest
is
over
you
in
all
matters
of
the
lord
and
zebadiah
the
son
of
ishmael
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
judah
for
all
the
king’s
matters
also
the
levites
shall
be
officers
before
you
deal
courageously
and
the
lord
shall
be
with
the
good
20
1
it
came
to
pass
after
this
also
that
the
children
of
moab
and
the
children
of
ammon
and
with
them
other
beside
the
ammonites
came
against
jehoshaphat
to
battle
20
2
then
there
came
some
that
told
jehoshaphat
saying
there
cometh
a
great
multitude
against
thee
from
beyond
the
sea
on
this
side
syria
and
behold
they
be
in
hazazontamar
which
is
engedi
20
3
and
jehoshaphat
feared
and
set
himself
to
seek
the
lord
and
proclaimed
a
fast
throughout
all
judah
20
4
and
judah
gathered
themselves
together
to
ask
help
of
the
lord
even
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
they
came
to
seek
the
lord
20
5
and
jehoshaphat
stood
in
the
congregation
of
judah
and
jerusalem
in
the
house
of
the
lord
before
the
new
court
20
6
and
said
o
lord
god
of
our
fathers
art
not
thou
god
in
heaven
and
rulest
not
thou
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
heathen
and
in
thine
hand
is
there
not
power
and
might
so
that
none
is
able
to
withstand
thee
20
7
art
not
thou
our
god
who
didst
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
before
thy
people
israel
and
gavest
it
to
the
seed
of
abraham
thy
friend
for
ever
20
8
and
they
dwelt
therein
and
have
built
thee
a
sanctuary
therein
for
thy
name
saying
20
9
if
when
evil
cometh
upon
us
as
the
sword
judgment
or
pestilence
or
famine
we
stand
before
this
house
and
in
thy
presence
(for
thy
name
is
in
this
house
)
and
cry
unto
thee
in
our
affliction
then
thou
wilt
hear
and
help
20
10
and
now
behold
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
and
mount
seir
whom
thou
wouldest
not
let
israel
invade
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
they
turned
from
them
and
destroyed
them
not
20
11
behold
i
say
how
they
reward
us
to
come
to
cast
us
out
of
thy
possession
which
thou
hast
given
us
to
inherit
20
12
o
our
god
wilt
thou
not
judge
them
for
we
have
no
might
against
this
great
company
that
cometh
against
us
neither
know
we
what
to
do
but
our
eyes
are
upon
thee
20
13
and
all
judah
stood
before
the
lord
with
their
little
ones
their
wives
and
their
children
20
14
then
upon
jahaziel
the
son
of
zechariah
the
son
of
benaiah
the
son
of
jeiel
the
son
of
mattaniah
a
levite
of
the
sons
of
asaph
came
the
spirit
of
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
20
15
and
he
said
hearken
ye
all
judah
and
ye
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
thou
king
jehoshaphat
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
you
be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
by
reason
of
this
great
multitude
for
the
battle
is
not
yours
but
god’s
20
16
to
morrow
go
ye
down
against
them
behold
they
come
up
by
the
cliff
of
ziz
and
ye
shall
find
them
at
the
end
of
the
brook
before
the
wilderness
of
jeruel
20
17
ye
shall
not
need
to
fight
in
this
battle
set
yourselves
stand
ye
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
with
you
o
judah
and
jerusalem
fear
not
nor
be
dismayed
to
morrow
go
out
against
them
for
the
lord
will
be
with
you
20
18
and
jehoshaphat
bowed
his
head
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
all
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
fell
before
the
lord
worshipping
the
lord
20
19
and
the
levites
of
the
children
of
the
kohathites
and
of
the
children
of
the
korhites
stood
up
to
praise
the
lord
god
of
israel
with
a
loud
voice
on
high
20
20
and
they
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
tekoa
and
as
they
went
forth
jehoshaphat
stood
and
said
hear
me
o
judah
and
ye
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
believe
in
the
lord
your
god
so
shall
ye
be
established
believe
his
prophets
so
shall
ye
prosper
20
21
and
when
he
had
consulted
with
the
people
he
appointed
singers
unto
the
lord
and
that
should
praise
the
beauty
of
holiness
as
they
went
out
before
the
army
and
to
say
praise
the
lord
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
20
22
and
when
they
began
to
sing
and
to
praise
the
lord
set
ambushments
against
the
children
of
ammon
moab
and
mount
seir
which
were
come
against
judah
and
they
were
smitten
20
23
for
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
stood
up
against
the
inhabitants
of
mount
seir
utterly
to
slay
and
destroy
them
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
the
inhabitants
of
seir
every
one
helped
to
destroy
another
20
24
and
when
judah
came
toward
the
watch
tower
in
the
wilderness
they
looked
unto
the
multitude
and
behold
they
were
dead
bodies
fallen
to
the
earth
and
none
escaped
20
25
and
when
jehoshaphat
and
his
people
came
to
take
away
the
spoil
of
them
they
found
among
them
in
abundance
both
riches
with
the
dead
bodies
and
precious
jewels
which
they
stripped
off
for
themselves
more
than
they
could
carry
away
and
they
were
three
days
in
gathering
of
the
spoil
it
was
so
much
20
26
and
on
the
fourth
day
they
assembled
themselves
in
the
valley
of
berachah
for
there
they
blessed
the
lord
therefore
the
name
of
the
same
place
was
called
the
valley
of
berachah
unto
this
day
20
27
then
they
returned
every
man
of
judah
and
jerusalem
and
jehoshaphat
in
the
forefront
of
them
to
go
again
to
jerusalem
with
joy
for
the
lord
had
made
them
to
rejoice
over
their
enemies
20
28
and
they
came
to
jerusalem
with
psalteries
and
harps
and
trumpets
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
20
29
and
the
fear
of
god
was
on
all
the
kingdoms
of
those
countries
when
they
had
heard
that
the
lord
fought
against
the
enemies
of
israel
20
30
so
the
realm
of
jehoshaphat
was
quiet
for
his
god
gave
him
rest
round
about
20
31
and
jehoshaphat
reigned
over
judah
he
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
azubah
the
daughter
of
shilhi
20
32
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
asa
his
father
and
departed
not
from
it
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
20
33
howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
for
as
yet
the
people
had
not
prepared
their
hearts
unto
the
god
of
their
fathers
20
34
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoshaphat
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
who
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
20
35
and
after
this
did
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
join
himself
with
ahaziah
king
of
israel
who
did
very
wickedly
20
36
and
he
joined
himself
with
him
to
make
ships
to
go
to
tarshish
and
they
made
the
ships
in
eziongaber
20

then
eliezer
the
son
of
dodavah
of
mareshah
prophesied
against
jehoshaphat
saying
because
thou
hast
joined
thyself
with
ahaziah
the
lord
hath
broken
thy
works
and
the
ships
were
broken
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
to
tarshish
21
1
now
jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
21
2
and
he
had
brethren
the
sons
of
jehoshaphat
azariah
and
jehiel
and
zechariah
and
azariah
and
michael
and
shephatiah
all
these
were
the
sons
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
israel
21
3
and
their
father
gave
them
great
gifts
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
of
precious
things
with
fenced
cities
in
judah
but
the
kingdom
gave
he
to
jehoram
because
he
was
the
firstborn
21
4
now
when
jehoram
was
risen
up
to
the
kingdom
of
his
father
he
strengthened
himself
and
slew
all
his
brethren
with
the
sword
and
divers
also
of
the
princes
of
israel
21
5
jehoram
was
thirty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
jerusalem
21
6
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
like
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
he
had
the
daughter
of
ahab
to
wife
and
he
wrought
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
21
7
howbeit
the
lord
would
not
destroy
the
house
of
david
because
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
david
and
as
he
promised
to
give
a
light
to
him
and
to
his
sons
for
ever
21
8
in
his
days
the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
dominion
of
judah
and
made
themselves
a
king
21
9
then
jehoram
went
forth
with
his
princes
and
all
his
chariots
with
him
and
he
rose
up
by
night
and
smote
the
edomites
which
compassed
him
in
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots
21
10
so
the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
unto
this
day
the
same
time
also
did
libnah
revolt
from
under
his
hand
because
he
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
21
11
moreover
he
made
high
places
in
the
mountains
of
judah
and
caused
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
commit
fornication
and
compelled
judah
thereto
21
12
and
there
came
a
writing
to
him
from
elijah
the
prophet
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
david
thy
father
because
thou
hast
not
walked
in
the
ways
of
jehoshaphat
thy
father
nor
in
the
ways
of
asa
king
of
judah
21
13
but
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
hast
made
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
go
a
whoring
like
to
the
whoredoms
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
also
hast
slain
thy
brethren
of
thy
father’s
house
which
were
better
than
thyself
21
14
behold
with
a
great
plague
will
the
lord
smite
thy
people
and
thy
children
and
thy
wives
and
all
thy
goods
21
15
and
thou
shalt
have
great
sickness
by
disease
of
thy
bowels
until
thy
bowels
fall
out
by
reason
of
the
sickness
day
by
day
21
16
moreover
the
lord
stirred
up
against
jehoram
the
spirit
of
the
philistines
and
of
the
arabians
that
were
near
the
ethiopians
21
17
and
they
came
up
into
judah
and
brake
into
it
and
carried
away
all
the
substance
that
was
found
in
the
king’s
house
and
his
sons
also
and
his
wives
so
that
there
was
never
a
son
left
him
save
jehoahaz
the
youngest
of
his
sons
21
18
and
after
all
this
the
lord
smote
him
in
his
bowels
with
an
incurable
disease
21
19
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
process
of
time
after
the
end
of
two
years
his
bowels
fell
out
by
reason
of
his
sickness
so
he
died
of
sore
diseases
and
his
people
made
no
burning
for
him
like
the
burning
of
his
fathers
21
20
thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
in
jerusalem
eight
years
and
departed
without
being
desired
howbeit
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
but
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
22
1
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
made
ahaziah
his
youngest
son
king
in
his
stead
for
the
band
of
men
that
came
with
the
arabians
to
the
camp
had
slain
all
the
eldest
so
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
reigned
22
2
forty
and
two
years
old
was
ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
athaliah
the
daughter
of
omri
22
3
he
also
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
house
of
ahab
for
his
mother
was
his
counsellor
to
do
wickedly
22
4
wherefore
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
the
house
of
ahab
for
they
were
his
counsellors
after
the
death
of
his
father
to
his
destruction
22
5
he
walked
also
after
their
counsel
and
went
with
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
to
war
against
hazael
king
of
syria
at
ramothgilead
and
the
syrians
smote
joram
22
6
and
he
returned
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
because
of
the
wounds
which
were
given
him
at
ramah
when
he
fought
with
hazael
king
of
syria
and
azariah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
went
down
to
see
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
at
jezreel
because
he
was
sick
22
7
and
the
destruction
of
ahaziah
was
of
god
by
coming
to
joram
for
when
he
was
come
he
went
out
with
jehoram
against
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
whom
the
lord
had
anointed
to
cut
off
the
house
of
ahab
22
8
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jehu
was
executing
judgment
upon
the
house
of
ahab
and
found
the
princes
of
judah
and
the
sons
of
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
that
ministered
to
ahaziah
he
slew
them
22
9
and
he
sought
ahaziah
and
they
caught
him
(for
he
was
hid
in
samaria
)
and
brought
him
to
jehu
and
when
they
had
slain
him
they
buried
him
because
said
they
he
is
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
who
sought
the
lord
with
all
his
heart
so
the
house
of
ahaziah
had
no
power
to
keep
still
the
kingdom
22
10
but
when
athaliah
the
mother
of
ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
of
the
house
of
judah
22
11
but
jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
the
king
took
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king’s
sons
that
were
slain
and
put
him
and
his
nurse
in
a
bedchamber
so
jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
king
jehoram
the
wife
of
jehoiada
the
priest
(for
she
was
the
sister
of
ahaziah
)
hid
him
from
athaliah
so
that
she
slew
him
not
22
12
and
he
was
with
them
hid
in
the
house
of
god
six
years
and
athaliah
reigned
over
the
land
23
1
and
in
the
seventh
year
jehoiada
strengthened
himself
and
took
the
captains
of
hundreds
azariah
the
son
of
jeroham
and
ishmael
the
son
of
jehohanan
and
azariah
the
son
of
obed
and
maaseiah
the
son
of
adaiah
and
elishaphat
the
son
of
zichri
into
covenant
with
him
23
2
and
they
went
about
in
judah
and
gathered
the
levites
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
and
they
came
to
jerusalem
23
3
and
all
the
congregation
made
a
covenant
with
the
king
in
the
house
of
god
and
he
said
unto
them
behold
the
king’s
son
shall
reign
as
the
lord
hath
said
of
the
sons
of
david
23
4
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
a
third
part
of
you
entering
on
the
sabbath
of
the
priests
and
of
the
levites
shall
be
porters
of
the
doors
23
5
and
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
king’s
house
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
of
the
foundation
and
all
the
people
shall
be
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
23
6
but
let
none
come
into
the
house
of
the
lord
save
the
priests
and
they
that
minister
of
the
levites
they
shall
go
in
for
they
are
holy
but
all
the
people
shall
keep
the
watch
of
the
lord
23
7
and
the
levites
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
whosoever
else
cometh
into
the
house
he
shall
be
put
to
death
but
be
ye
with
the
king
when
he
cometh
in
and
when
he
goeth
out
23
8
so
the
levites
and
all
judah
did
according
to
all
things
that
jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded
and
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath
with
them
that
were
to
go
out
on
the
sabbath
for
jehoiada
the
priest
dismissed
not
the
courses
23
9
moreover
jehoiada
the
priest
delivered
to
the
captains
of
hundreds
spears
and
bucklers
and
shields
that
had
been
king
david’s
which
were
in
the
house
of
god
23
10
and
he
set
all
the
people
every
man
having
his
weapon
in
his
hand
from
the
right
side
of
the
temple
to
the
left
side
of
the
temple
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple
by
the
king
round
about
23
11
then
they
brought
out
the
king’s
son
and
put
upon
him
the
crown
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
made
him
king
and
jehoiada
and
his
sons
anointed
him
and
said
god
save
the
king
23
12
now
when
athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
running
and
praising
the
king
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
house
of
the
lord
23
13
and
she
looked
and
behold
the
king
stood
at
his
pillar
at
the
entering
in
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpets
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
sounded
with
trumpets
also
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick
and
such
as
taught
to
sing
praise
then
athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
said
treason
treason
23
14
then
jehoiada
the
priest
brought
out
the
captains
of
hundreds
that
were
set
over
the
host
and
said
unto
them
have
her
forth
of
the
ranges
and
whoso
followeth
her
let
him
be
slain
with
the
sword
for
the
priest
said
slay
her
not
in
the
house
of
the
lord
23
15
so
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
when
she
was
come
to
the
entering
of
the
horse
gate
by
the
king’s
house
they
slew
her
there
23
16
and
jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
him
and
between
all
the
people
and
between
the
king
that
they
should
be
the
lord’s
people
23
17
then
all
the
people
went
to
the
house
of
baal
and
brake
it
down
and
brake
his
altars
and
his
images
in
pieces
and
slew
mattan
the
priest
of
baal
before
the
altars
23
18
also
jehoiada
appointed
the
offices
of
the
house
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
the
priests
the
levites
whom
david
had
distributed
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
offer
the
burnt
offerings
of
the
lord
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
with
rejoicing
and
with
singing
as
it
was
ordained
by
david
23
19
and
he
set
the
porters
at
the
gates
of
the
house
of
the
lord
that
none
which
was
unclean
in
any
thing
should
enter
in
23
20
and
he
took
the
captains
of
hundreds
and
the
nobles
and
the
governors
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
came
through
the
high
gate
into
the
king’s
house
and
set
the
king
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
23
21
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
after
that
they
had
slain
athaliah
with
the
sword
24
1
joash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
forty
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
zibiah
of
beersheba
24
2
and
joash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
the
days
of
jehoiada
the
priest
24
3
and
jehoiada
took
for
him
two
wives
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
24
4
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
joash
was
minded
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
24
5
and
he
gathered
together
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
said
to
them
go
out
unto
the
cities
of
judah
and
gather
of
all
israel
money
to
repair
the
house
of
your
god
from
year
to
year
and
see
that
ye
hasten
the
matter
howbeit
the
levites
hastened
it
not
24
6
and
the
king
called
for
jehoiada
the
chief
and
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
not
required
of
the
levites
to
bring
in
out
of
judah
and
out
of
jerusalem
the
collection
according
to
the
commandment
of
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
and
of
the
congregation
of
israel
for
the
tabernacle
of
witness
24
7
for
the
sons
of
athaliah
that
wicked
woman
had
broken
up
the
house
of
god
and
also
all
the
dedicated
things
of
the
house
of
the
lord
did
they
bestow
upon
baalim
24
8
and
at
the
king’s
commandment
they
made
a
chest
and
set
it
without
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
lord
24
9
and
they
made
a
proclamation
through
judah
and
jerusalem
to
bring
in
to
the
lord
the
collection
that
moses
the
servant
of
god
laid
upon
israel
in
the
wilderness
24
10
and
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
and
brought
in
and
cast
into
the
chest
until
they
had
made
an
end
24
11
now
it
came
to
pass
that
at
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
king’s
office
by
the
hand
of
the
levites
and
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
the
king’s
scribe
and
the
high
priest’s
officer
came
and
emptied
the
chest
and
took
it
and
carried
it
to
his
place
again
thus
they
did
day
by
day
and
gathered
money
in
abundance
24
12
and
the
king
and
jehoiada
gave
it
to
such
as
did
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hired
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
and
also
such
as
wrought
iron
and
brass
to
mend
the
house
of
the
lord
24
13
so
the
workmen
wrought
and
the
work
was
perfected
by
them
and
they
set
the
house
of
god
in
his
state
and
strengthened
it
24
14
and
when
they
had
finished
it
they
brought
the
rest
of
the
money
before
the
king
and
jehoiada
whereof
were
made
vessels
for
the
house
of
the
lord
even
vessels
to
minister
and
to
offer
withal
and
spoons
and
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
they
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
house
of
the
lord
continually
all
the
days
of
jehoiada
24
15
but
jehoiada
waxed
old
and
was
full
of
days
when
he
died
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
was
he
when
he
died
24
16
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
among
the
kings
because
he
had
done
good
in
israel
both
toward
god
and
toward
his
house
24
17
now
after
the
death
of
jehoiada
came
the
princes
of
judah
and
made
obeisance
to
the
king
then
the
king
hearkened
unto
them
24
18
and
they
left
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
served
groves
and
idols
and
wrath
came
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
for
this
their
trespass
24
19
yet
he
sent
prophets
to
them
to
bring
them
again
unto
the
lord
and
they
testified
against
them
but
they
would
not
give
ear
24
20
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
zechariah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
priest
which
stood
above
the
people
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
god
why
transgress
ye
the
commandments
of
the
lord
that
ye
cannot
prosper
because
ye
have
forsaken
the
lord
he
hath
also
forsaken
you
24
21
and
they
conspired
against
him
and
stoned
him
with
stones
at
the
commandment
of
the
king
in
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
lord
24
22
thus
joash
the
king
remembered
not
the
kindness
which
jehoiada
his
father
had
done
to
him
but
slew
his
son
and
when
he
died
he
said
the
lord
look
upon
it
and
require
it
24
23
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
the
host
of
syria
came
up
against
him
and
they
came
to
judah
and
jerusalem
and
destroyed
all
the
princes
of
the
people
from
among
the
people
and
sent
all
the
spoil
of
them
unto
the
king
of
damascus
24
24
for
the
army
of
the
syrians
came
with
a
small
company
of
men
and
the
lord
delivered
a
very
great
host
into
their
hand
because
they
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
so
they
executed
judgment
against
joash
24
25
and
when
they
were
departed
from
him
(for
they
left
him
in
great
diseases
)
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
for
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
jehoiada
the
priest
and
slew
him
on
his
bed
and
he
died
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
but
they
buried
him
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
24
26
and
these
are
they
that
conspired
against
him
zabad
the
son
of
shimeath
an
ammonitess
and
jehozabad
the
son
of
shimrith
a
moabitess
24
27
now
concerning
his
sons
and
the
greatness
of
the
burdens
laid
upon
him
and
the
repairing
of
the
house
of
god
behold
they
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
book
of
the
kings
and
amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
25
1
amaziah
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
jehoaddan
of
jerusalem
25
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
not
with
a
perfect
heart
25
3
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
kingdom
was
established
to
him
that
he
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
father
25
4
but
he
slew
not
their
children
but
did
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
in
the
book
of
moses
where
the
lord
commanded
saying
the
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
fathers
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
sin
25
5
moreover
amaziah
gathered
judah
together
and
made
them
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
hundreds
according
to
the
houses
of
their
fathers
throughout
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
he
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
above
and
found
them
three
hundred
thousand
choice
men
able
to
go
forth
to
war
that
could
handle
spear
and
shield
25
6
he
hired
also
an
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
out
of
israel
for
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
25
7
but
there
came
a
man
of
god
to
him
saying
o
king
let
not
the
army
of
israel
go
with
thee
for
the
lord
is
not
with
israel
to
wit
with
all
the
children
of
ephraim
25
8
but
if
thou
wilt
go
do
it
be
strong
for
the
battle
god
shall
make
thee
fall
before
the
enemy
for
god
hath
power
to
help
and
to
cast
down
25
9
and
amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
god
but
what
shall
we
do
for
the
hundred
talents
which
i
have
given
to
the
army
of
israel
and
the
man
of
god
answered
the
lord
is
able
to
give
thee
much
more
than
this
25
10
then
amaziah
separated
them
to
wit
the
army
that
was
come
to
him
out
of
ephraim
to
go
home
again
wherefore
their
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
judah
and
they
returned
home
in
great
anger
25
11
and
amaziah
strengthened
himself
and
led
forth
his
people
and
went
to
the
valley
of
salt
and
smote
of
the
children
of
seir
ten
thousand
25
12
and
other
ten
thousand
left
alive
did
the
children
of
judah
carry
away
captive
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
rock
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
rock
that
they
all
were
broken
in
pieces
25
13
but
the
soldiers
of
the
army
which
amaziah
sent
back
that
they
should
not
go
with
him
to
battle
fell
upon
the
cities
of
judah
from
samaria
even
unto
bethhoron
and
smote
three
thousand
of
them
and
took
much
spoil
25
14
now
it
came
to
pass
after
that
amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
of
the
edomites
that
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
children
of
seir
and
set
them
up
to
be
his
gods
and
bowed
down
himself
before
them
and
burned
incense
unto
them
25
15
wherefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
amaziah
and
he
sent
unto
him
a
prophet
which
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
sought
after
the
gods
of
the
people
which
could
not
deliver
their
own
people
out
of
thine
hand
25
16
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
talked
with
him
that
the
king
said
unto
him
art
thou
made
of
the
king’s
counsel
forbear
why
shouldest
thou
be
smitten
then
the
prophet
forbare
and
said
i
know
that
god
hath
determined
to
destroy
thee
because
thou
hast
done
this
and
hast
not
hearkened
unto
my
counsel
25
17
then
amaziah
king
of
judah
took
advice
and
sent
to
joash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
the
son
of
jehu
king
of
israel
saying
come
let
us
see
one
another
in
the
face
25
18
and
joash
king
of
israel
sent
to
amaziah
king
of
judah
saying
the
thistle
that
was
in
lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
lebanon
saying
give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
lebanon
and
trode
down
the
thistle
25
19
thou
sayest
lo
thou
hast
smitten
the
edomites
and
thine
heart
lifteth
thee
up
to
boast
abide
now
at
home
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thine
hurt
that
thou
shouldest
fall
even
thou
and
judah
with
thee
25
20
but
amaziah
would
not
hear
for
it
came
of
god
that
he
might
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
because
they
sought
after
the
gods
of
edom
25
21
so
joash
the
king
of
israel
went
up
and
they
saw
one
another
in
the
face
both
he
and
amaziah
king
of
judah
at
bethshemesh
which
belongeth
to
judah
25
22
and
judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
and
they
fled
every
man
to
his
tent
25
23
and
joash
the
king
of
israel
took
amaziah
king
of
judah
the
son
of
joash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
at
bethshemesh
and
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
ephraim
to
the
corner
gate
four
hundred
cubits
25
24
and
he
took
all
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
all
the
vessels
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
god
with
obededom
and
the
treasures
of
the
king’s
house
the
hostages
also
and
returned
to
samaria
25
25
and
amaziah
the
son
of
joash
king
of
judah
lived
after
the
death
of
joash
son
of
jehoahaz
king
of
israel
fifteen
years
25
26
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
amaziah
first
and
last
behold
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
25
27
now
after
the
time
that
amaziah
did
turn
away
from
following
the
lord
they
made
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
jerusalem
and
he
fled
to
lachish
but
they
sent
to
lachish
after
him
and
slew
him
there
25
28
and
they
brought
him
upon
horses
and
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
judah
26
1
then
all
the
people
of
judah
took
uzziah
who
was
sixteen
years
old
and
made
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
amaziah
26
2
he
built
eloth
and
restored
it
to
judah
after
that
the
king
slept
with
his
fathers
26
3
sixteen
years
old
was
uzziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
two
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
jecoliah
of
jerusalem
26
4
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
father
amaziah
did
26
5
and
he
sought
god
in
the
days
of
zechariah
who
had
understanding
in
the
visions
of
god
and
as
long
as
he
sought
the
lord
god
made
him
to
prosper
26
6
and
he
went
forth
and
warred
against
the
philistines
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
gath
and
the
wall
of
jabneh
and
the
wall
of
ashdod
and
built
cities
about
ashdod
and
among
the
philistines
26
7
and
god
helped
him
against
the
philistines
and
against
the
arabians
that
dwelt
in
gurbaal
and
the
mehunims
26
8
and
the
ammonites
gave
gifts
to
uzziah
and
his
name
spread
abroad
even
to
the
entering
in
of
egypt
for
he
strengthened
himself
exceedingly
26
9
moreover
uzziah
built
towers
in
jerusalem
at
the
corner
gate
and
at
the
valley
gate
and
at
the
turning
of
the
wall
and
fortified
them
26
10
also
he
built
towers
in
the
desert
and
digged
many
wells
for
he
had
much
cattle
both
in
the
low
country
and
in
the
plains
husbandmen
also
and
vine
dressers
in
the
mountains
and
in
carmel
for
he
loved
husbandry
26
11
moreover
uzziah
had
an
host
of
fighting
men
that
went
out
to
war
by
bands
according
to
the
number
of
their
account
by
the
hand
of
jeiel
the
scribe
and
maaseiah
the
ruler
under
the
hand
of
hananiah
one
of
the
king’s
captains
26
12
the
whole
number
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
mighty
men
of
valour
were
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
26
13
and
under
their
hand
was
an
army
three
hundred
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
five
hundred
that
made
war
with
mighty
power
to
help
the
king
against
the
enemy
26
14
and
uzziah
prepared
for
them
throughout
all
the
host
shields
and
spears
and
helmets
and
habergeons
and
bows
and
slings
to
cast
stones
26
15
and
he
made
in
jerusalem
engines
invented
by
cunning
men
to
be
on
the
towers
and
upon
the
bulwarks
to
shoot
arrows
and
great
stones
withal
and
his
name
spread
far
abroad
for
he
was
marvellously
helped
till
he
was
strong
26
16
but
when
he
was
strong
his
heart
was
lifted
up
to
his
destruction
for
he
transgressed
against
the
lord
his
god
and
went
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
to
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
of
incense
26
17
and
azariah
the
priest
went
in
after
him
and
with
him
fourscore
priests
of
the
lord
that
were
valiant
men
26
18
and
they
withstood
uzziah
the
king
and
said
unto
him
it
appertaineth
not
unto
thee
uzziah
to
burn
incense
unto
the
lord
but
to
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
that
are
consecrated
to
burn
incense
go
out
of
the
sanctuary
for
thou
hast
trespassed
neither
shall
it
be
for
thine
honour
from
the
lord
god
26
19
then
uzziah
was
wroth
and
had
a
censer
in
his
hand
to
burn
incense
and
while
he
was
wroth
with
the
priests
the
leprosy
even
rose
up
in
his
forehead
before
the
priests
in
the
house
of
the
lord
from
beside
the
incense
altar
26
20
and
azariah
the
chief
priest
and
all
the
priests
looked
upon
him
and
behold
he
was
leprous
in
his
forehead
and
they
thrust
him
out
from
thence
yea
himself
hasted
also
to
go
out
because
the
lord
had
smitten
him
26
21
and
uzziah
the
king
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
death
and
dwelt
in
a
several
house
being
a
leper
for
he
was
cut
off
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
jotham
his
son
was
over
the
king’s
house
judging
the
people
of
the
land
26
22
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
uzziah
first
and
last
did
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
write
26
23
so
uzziah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
field
of
the
burial
which
belonged
to
the
kings
for
they
said
he
is
a
leper
and
jotham
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
27
1
jotham
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother’s
name
also
was
jerushah
the
daughter
of
zadok
27
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
father
uzziah
did
howbeit
he
entered
not
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
the
people
did
yet
corruptly
27
3
he
built
the
high
gate
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
on
the
wall
of
ophel
he
built
much
27
4
moreover
he
built
cities
in
the
mountains
of
judah
and
in
the
forests
he
built
castles
and
towers
27
5
he
fought
also
with
the
king
of
the
ammonites
and
prevailed
against
them
and
the
children
of
ammon
gave
him
the
same
year
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
ten
thousand
measures
of
wheat
and
ten
thousand
of
barley
so
much
did
the
children
of
ammon
pay
unto
him
both
the
second
year
and
the
third
27
6
so
jotham
became
mighty
because
he
prepared
his
ways
before
the
lord
his
god
27
7
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jotham
and
all
his
wars
and
his
ways
lo
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
27
8
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
27
9
and
jotham
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
ahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
28
1
ahaz
was
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
but
he
did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
david
his
father
28
2
for
he
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
made
also
molten
images
for

moreover
he
burnt
incense
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
and
burnt
his
children
in
the
fire
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
28
4
he
sacrificed
also
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places
and
on
the
hills
and
under
every
green
tree
28
5
wherefore
the
lord
his
god
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
and
they
smote
him
and
carried
away
a
great
multitude
of
them
captives
and
brought
them
to
damascus
and
he
was
also
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
israel
who
smote
him
with
a
great
slaughter
28
6
for
pekah
the
son
of
remaliah
slew
in
judah
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
in
one
day
which
were
all
valiant
men
because
they
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
28
7
and
zichri
a
mighty
man
of
ephraim
slew
maaseiah
the
king’s
son
and
azrikam
the
governor
of
the
house
and
elkanah
that
was
next
to
the
king
28
8
and
the
children
of
israel
carried
away
captive
of
their
brethren
two
hundred
thousand
women
sons
and
daughters
and
took
also
away
much
spoil
from
them
and
brought
the
spoil
to
samaria
28
9
but
a
prophet
of
the
lord
was
there
whose
name
was
oded
and
he
went
out
before
the
host
that
came
to
samaria
and
said
unto
them
behold
because
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
was
wroth
with
judah
he
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand
and
ye
have
slain
them
in
a
rage
that
reacheth
up
unto
heaven
28
10
and
now
ye
purpose
to
keep
under
the
children
of
judah
and
jerusalem
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
unto
you
but
are
there
not
with
you
even
with
you
sins
against
the
lord
your
god
28
11
now
hear
me
therefore
and
deliver
the
captives
again
which
ye
have
taken
captive
of
your
brethren
for
the
fierce
wrath
of
the
lord
is
upon
you
28
12
then
certain
of
the
heads
of
the
children
of
ephraim
azariah
the
son
of
johanan
berechiah
the
son
of
meshillemoth
and
jehizkiah
the
son
of
shallum
and
amasa
the
son
of
hadlai
stood
up
against
them
that
came
from
the
war
28
13
and
said
unto
them
ye
shall
not
bring
in
the
captives
hither
for
whereas
we
have
offended
against
the
lord
already
ye
intend
to
add
more
to
our
sins
and
to
our
trespass
for
our
trespass
is
great
and
there
is
fierce
wrath
against
israel
28
14
so
the
armed
men
left
the
captives
and
the
spoil
before
the
princes
and
all
the
congregation
28
15
and
the
men
which
were
expressed
by
name
rose
up
and
took
the
captives
and
with
the
spoil
clothed
all
that
were
naked
among
them
and
arrayed
them
and
shod
them
and
gave
them
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
anointed
them
and
carried
all
the
feeble
of
them
upon
asses
and
brought
them
to
jericho
the
city
of
palm
trees
to
their
brethren
then
they
returned
to
samaria
28
16
at
that
time
did
king
ahaz
send
unto
the
kings
of
assyria
to
help
him
28
17
for
again
the
edomites
had
come
and
smitten
judah
and
carried
away
captives
28
18
the
philistines
also
had
invaded
the
cities
of
the
low
country
and
of
the
south
of
judah
and
had
taken
bethshemesh
and
ajalon
and
gederoth
and
shocho
with
the
villages
thereof
and
timnah
with
the
villages
thereof
gimzo
also
and
the
villages
thereof
and
they
dwelt
there
28
19
for
the
lord
brought
judah
low
because
of
ahaz
king
of
israel
for
he
made
judah
naked
and
transgressed
sore
against
the
lord
28
20
and
tilgathpilneser
king
of
assyria
came
unto
him
and
distressed
him
but
strengthened
him
not
28
21
for
ahaz
took
away
a
portion
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
out
of
the
house
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes
and
gave
it
unto
the
king
of
assyria
but
he
helped
him
not
28
22
and
in
the
time
of
his
distress
did
he
trespass
yet
more
against
the
lord
this
is
that
king
ahaz
28
23
for
he
sacrificed
unto
the
gods
of
damascus
which
smote
him
and
he
said
because
the
gods
of
the
kings
of
syria
help
them
therefore
will
i
sacrifice
to
them
that
they
may
help
me
but
they
were
the
ruin
of
him
and
of
all
israel
28
24
and
ahaz
gathered
together
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
and
cut
in
pieces
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
and
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
made
him
altars
in
every
corner
of
jerusalem
28
25
and
in
every
several
city
of
judah
he
made
high
places
to
burn
incense
unto
other
gods
and
provoked
to
anger
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
28
26
now
the
rest
of
his
acts
and
of
all
his
ways
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
28
27
and
ahaz
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
even
in
jerusalem
but
they
brought
him
not
into
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
hezekiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
29
1
hezekiah
began
to
reign
when
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
and
he
reigned
nine
and
twenty
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
abijah
the
daughter
of
zechariah
29
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
david
his
father
had
done
29
3
he
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
in
the
first
month
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
repaired
them
29
4
and
he
brought
in
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
gathered
them
together
into
the
east
street
29
5
and
said
unto
them
hear
me
ye
levites
sanctify
now
yourselves
and
sanctify
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
and
carry
forth
the
filthiness
out
of
the
holy
place
29
6
for
our
fathers
have
trespassed
and
done
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
our
god
and
have
forsaken
him
and
have
turned
away
their
faces
from
the
habitation
of
the
lord
and
turned
their
backs
29
7
also
they
have
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
porch
and
put
out
the
lamps
and
have
not
burned
incense
nor
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
holy
place
unto
the
god
of
israel
29
8
wherefore
the
wrath
of
the
lord
was
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
and
he
hath
delivered
them
to
trouble
to
astonishment
and
to
hissing
as
ye
see
with
your
eyes
29
9
for
lo
our
fathers
have
fallen
by
the
sword
and
our
sons
and
our
daughters
and
our
wives
are
in
captivity
for
this
29
10
now
it
is
in
mine
heart
to
make
a
covenant
with
the
lord
god
of
israel
that
his
fierce
wrath
may
turn
away
from
us
29
11
my
sons
be
not
now
negligent
for
the
lord
hath
chosen
you
to
stand
before
him
to
serve
him
and
that
ye
should
minister
unto
him
and
burn
incense
29
12
then
the
levites
arose
mahath
the
son
of
amasai
and
joel
the
son
of
azariah
of
the
sons
of
the
kohathites
and
of
the
sons
of
merari
kish
the
son
of
abdi
and
azariah
the
son
of
jehalelel
and
of
the
gershonites
joah
the
son
of
zimmah
and
eden
the
son
of
joah
29
13
and
of
the
sons
of
elizaphan
shimri
and
jeiel
and
of
the
sons
of
asaph
zechariah
and
mattaniah
29
14
and
of
the
sons
of
heman
jehiel
and
shimei
and
of
the
sons
of
jeduthun
shemaiah
and
uzziel
29
15
and
they
gathered
their
brethren
and
sanctified
themselves
and
came
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king
by
the
words
of
the
lord
to
cleanse
the
house
of
the
lord
29
16
and
the
priests
went
into
the
inner
part
of
the
house
of
the
lord
to
cleanse
it
and
brought
out
all
the
uncleanness
that
they
found
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
into
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
levites
took
it
to
carry
it
out
abroad
into
the
brook
kidron
29
17
now
they
began
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
to
sanctify
and
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
month
came
they
to
the
porch
of
the
lord
so
they
sanctified
the
house
of
the
lord
in
eight
days
and
in
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
they
made
an
end
29
18
then
they
went
in
to
hezekiah
the
king
and
said
we
have
cleansed
all
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
with
all
the
vessels
thereof
and
the
shewbread
table
with
all
the
vessels
thereof
29
19
moreover
all
the
vessels
which
king
ahaz
in
his
reign
did
cast
away
in
his
transgression
have
we
prepared
and
sanctified
and
behold
they
are
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
29
20
then
hezekiah
the
king
rose
early
and
gathered
the
rulers
of
the
city
and
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
29
21
and
they
brought
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
and
seven
lambs
and
seven
he
goats
for
a
sin
offering
for
the
kingdom
and
for
the
sanctuary
and
for
judah
and
he
commanded
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
to
offer
them
on
the
altar
of
the
lord
29
22
so
they
killed
the
bullocks
and
the
priests
received
the
blood
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
altar
likewise
when
they
had
killed
the
rams
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
they
killed
also
the
lambs
and
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
29
23
and
they
brought
forth
the
he
goats
for
the
sin
offering
before
the
king
and
the
congregation
and
they
laid
their
hands
upon
them
29
24
and
the
priests
killed
them
and
they
made
reconciliation
with
their
blood
upon
the
altar
to
make
an
atonement
for
all
israel
for
the
king
commanded
that
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
should
be
made
for
all
israel
29
25
and
he
set
the
levites
in
the
house
of
the
lord
with
cymbals
with
psalteries
and
with
harps
according
to
the
commandment
of
david
and
of
gad
the
king’s
seer
and
nathan
the
prophet
for
so
was
the
commandment
of
the
lord
by
his
prophets
29
26
and
the
levites
stood
with
the
instruments
of
david
and
the
priests
with
the
trumpets
29
27
and
hezekiah
commanded
to
offer
the
burnt
offering
upon
the
altar
and
when
the
burnt
offering
began
the
song
of
the
lord
began
also
with
the
trumpets
and
with
the
instruments
ordained
by
david
king
of
israel
29
28
and
all
the
congregation
worshipped
and
the
singers
sang
and
the
trumpeters
sounded
and
all
this
continued
until
the
burnt
offering
was
finished
29
29
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
king
and
all
that
were
present
with
him
bowed
themselves
and
worshipped
29
30
moreover
hezekiah
the
king
and
the
princes
commanded
the
levites
to
sing
praise
unto
the
lord
with
the
words
of
david
and
of
asaph
the
seer
and
they
sang
praises
with
gladness
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
29
31
then
hezekiah
answered
and
said
now
ye
have
consecrated
yourselves
unto
the
lord
come
near
and
bring
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
congregation
brought
in
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
and
as
many
as
were
of
a
free
heart
burnt
offerings
29
32
and
the
number
of
the
burnt
offerings
which
the
congregation
brought
was
threescore
and
ten
bullocks
an
hundred
rams
and
two
hundred
lambs
all
these
were
for
a
burnt
offering
to
the
lord
29
33
and
the
consecrated
things
were
six
hundred
oxen
and
three
thousand
sheep
29
34
but
the
priests
were
too
few
so
that
they
could
not
flay
all
the
burnt
offerings
wherefore
their
brethren
the
levites
did
help
them
till
the
work
was
ended
and
until
the
other
priests
had
sanctified
themselves
for
the
levites
were
more
upright
in
heart
to
sanctify
themselves
than
the
priests
29
35
and
also
the
burnt
offerings
were
in
abundance
with
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
and
the
drink
offerings
for
every
burnt
offering
so
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
was
set
in
order
29
36
and
hezekiah
rejoiced
and
all
the
people
that
god
had
prepared
the
people
for
the
thing
was
done
suddenly
30
1
and
hezekiah
sent
to
all
israel
and
judah
and
wrote
letters
also
to
ephraim
and
manasseh
that
they
should
come
to
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
30
2
for
the
king
had
taken
counsel
and
his
princes
and
all
the
congregation
in
jerusalem
to
keep
the
passover
in
the
second
month
30
3
for
they
could
not
keep
it
at
that
time
because
the
priests
had
not
sanctified
themselves
sufficiently
neither
had
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
to
jerusalem
30
4
and
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
all
the
congregation
30
5
so
they
established
a
decree
to
make
proclamation
throughout
all
israel
from
beersheba
even
to
dan
that
they
should
come
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
at
jerusalem
for
they
had
not
done
it
of
a
long
time
in
such
sort
as
it
was
written
30
6
so
the
posts
went
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
throughout
all
israel
and
judah
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king
saying
ye
children
of
israel
turn
again
unto
the
lord
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
israel
and
he
will
return
to
the
remnant
of
you
that
are
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
assyria
30
7
and
be
not
ye
like
your
fathers
and
like
your
brethren
which
trespassed
against
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
who
therefore
gave
them
up
to
desolation
as
ye
see
30
8
now
be
ye
not
stiffnecked
as
your
fathers
were
but
yield
yourselves
unto
the
lord
and
enter
into
his
sanctuary
which
he
hath
sanctified
for
ever
and
serve
the
lord
your
god
that
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
may
turn
away
from
you
30
9
for
if
ye
turn
again
unto
the
lord
your
brethren
and
your
children
shall
find
compassion
before
them
that
lead
them
captive
so
that
they
shall
come
again
into
this
land
for
the
lord
your
god
is
gracious
and
merciful
and
will
not
turn
away
his
face
from
you
if
ye
return
unto
him
30
10
so
the
posts
passed
from
city
to
city
through
the
country
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
even
unto
zebulun
but
they
laughed
them
to
scorn
and
mocked
them
30
11
nevertheless
divers
of
asher
and
manasseh
and
of
zebulun
humbled
themselves
and
came
to
jerusalem
30
12
also
in
judah
the
hand
of
god
was
to
give
them
one
heart
to
do
the
commandment
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes
by
the
word
of
the
lord
30
13
and
there
assembled
at
jerusalem
much
people
to
keep
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
in
the
second
month
a
very
great
congregation
30
14
and
they
arose
and
took
away
the
altars
that
were
in
jerusalem
and
all
the
altars
for
incense
took
they
away
and
cast
them
into
the
brook
kidron
30
15
then
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
second
month
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
were
ashamed
and
sanctified
themselves
and
brought
in
the
burnt
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
30
16
and
they
stood
in
their
place
after
their
manner
according
to
the
law
of
moses
the
man
of
god
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
which
they
received
of
the
hand
of
the
levites
30
17
for
there
were
many
in
the
congregation
that
were
not
sanctified
therefore
the
levites
had
the
charge
of
the
killing
of
the
passovers
for
every
one
that
was
not
clean
to
sanctify
them
unto
the
lord
30
18
for
a
multitude
of
the
people
even
many
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
issachar
and
zebulun
had
not
cleansed
themselves
yet
did
they
eat
the
passover
otherwise
than
it
was
written
but
hezekiah
prayed
for
them
saying
the
good
lord
pardon
every
one
30
19
that
prepareth
his
heart
to
seek
god
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
though
he
be
not
cleansed
according
to
the
purification
of
the
sanctuary
30
20
and
the
lord
hearkened
to
hezekiah
and
healed
the
people
30
21
and
the
children
of
israel
that
were
present
at
jerusalem
kept
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
with
great
gladness
and
the
levites
and
the
priests
praised
the
lord
day
by
day
singing
with
loud
instruments
unto
the
lord
30
22
and
hezekiah
spake
comfortably
unto
all
the
levites
that
taught
the
good
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
they
did
eat
throughout
the
feast
seven
days
offering
peace
offerings
and
making
confession
to
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
30
23
and
the
whole
assembly
took
counsel
to
keep
other
seven
days
and
they
kept
other
seven
days
with
gladness
30
24
for
hezekiah
king
of
judah
did
give
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
seven
thousand
sheep
and
the
princes
gave
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
ten
thousand
sheep
and
a
great
number
of
priests
sanctified
themselves
30
25
and
all
the
congregation
of
judah
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
the
congregation
that
came
out
of
israel
and
the
strangers
that
came
out
of
the
land
of
israel
and
that
dwelt
in
judah
rejoiced
30
26
so
there
was
great
joy
in
jerusalem
for
since
the
time
of
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
of
israel
there
was
not
the
like
in
jerusalem
30
27
then
the
priests
the
levites
arose
and
blessed
the
people
and
their
voice
was
heard
and
their
prayer
came
up
to
his
holy
dwelling
place
even
unto
heaven
31
1
now
when
all
this
was
finished
all
israel
that
were
present
went
out
to
the
cities
of
judah
and
brake
the
images
in
pieces
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
threw
down
the
high
places
and
the
altars
out
of
all
judah
and
benjamin
in
ephraim
also
and
manasseh
until
they
had
utterly
destroyed
them
all
then
all
the
children
of
israel
returned
every
man
to
his
possession
into
their
own
cities
31
2
and
hezekiah
appointed
the
courses
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
after
their
courses
every
man
according
to
his
service
the
priests
and
levites
for
burnt
offerings
and
for
peace
offerings
to
minister
and
to
give
thanks
and
to
praise
in
the
gates
of
the
tents
of
the
lord
31
3
he
appointed
also
the
king’s
portion
of
his
substance
for
the
burnt
offerings
to
wit
for
the
morning
and
evening
burnt
offerings
and
the
burnt
offerings
for
the
sabbaths
and
for
the
new
moons
and
for
the
set
feasts
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
lord
31
4
moreover
he
commanded
the
people
that
dwelt
in
jerusalem
to
give
the
portion
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
that
they
might
be
encouraged
in
the
law
of
the
lord
31
5
and
as
soon
as
the
commandment
came
abroad
the
children
of
israel
brought
in
abundance
the
firstfruits
of
corn
wine
and
oil
and
honey
and
of
all
the
increase
of
the
field
and
the
tithe
of
all
things
brought
they
in
abundantly
31
6
and
concerning
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
they
also
brought
in
the
tithe
of
oxen
and
sheep
and
the
tithe
of
holy
things
which
were
consecrated
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
laid
them
by
heaps
31
7
in
the
third
month
they
began
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
heaps
and
finished
them
in
the
seventh
month
31
8
and
when
hezekiah
and
the
princes
came
and
saw
the
heaps
they
blessed
the
lord
and
his
people
israel
31
9
then
hezekiah
questioned
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
concerning
the
heaps
31
10
and
azariah
the
chief
priest
of
the
house
of
zadok
answered
him
and
said
since
the
people
began
to
bring
the
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
we
have
had
enough
to
eat
and
have
left
plenty
for
the
lord
hath
blessed
his
people
and
that
which
is
left
is
this
great
store
31
11
then
hezekiah
commanded
to
prepare
chambers
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
prepared
them
31
12
and
brought
in
the
offerings
and
the
tithes
and
the
dedicated
things
faithfully
over
which
cononiah
the
levite
was
ruler
and
shimei
his
brother
was
the
next
31
13
and
jehiel
and
azaziah
and
nahath
and
asahel
and
jerimoth
and
jozabad
and
eliel
and
ismachiah
and
mahath
and
benaiah
were
overseers
under
the
hand
of
cononiah
and
shimei
his
brother
at
the
commandment
of
hezekiah
the
king
and
azariah
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
god
31
14
and
kore
the
son
of
imnah
the
levite
the
porter
toward
the
east
was
over
the
freewill
offerings
of
god
to
distribute
the
oblations
of
the
lord
and
the
most
holy
things
31
15
and
next
him
were
eden
and
miniamin
and
jeshua
and
shemaiah
amariah
and
shecaniah
in
the
cities
of
the
priests
in
their
set
office
to
give
to
their
brethren
by
courses
as
well
to
the
great
as
to
the
small
31
16
beside
their
genealogy
of
males
from
three
years
old
and
upward
even
unto
every
one
that
entereth
into
the
house
of
the
lord
his
daily
portion
for
their
service
in
their
charges
according
to
their
courses
31
17
both
to
the
genealogy
of
the
priests
by
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
the
levites
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
in
their
charges
by
their
courses
31
18
and
to
the
genealogy
of
all
their
little
ones
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
through
all
the
congregation
for
in
their
set
office
they
sanctified
themselves
in
holiness
31
19
also
of
the
sons
of
aaron
the
priests
which
were
in
the
fields
of
the
suburbs
of
their
cities
in
every
several
city
the
men
that
were
expressed
by
name
to
give
portions
to
all
the
males
among
the
priests
and
to
all
that
were
reckoned
by
genealogies
among
the
levites
31
20
and
thus
did
hezekiah
throughout
all
judah
and
wrought
that
which
was
good
and
right
and
truth
before
the
lord
his
god
31
21
and
in
every
work
that
he
began
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
god
and
in
the
law
and
in
the
commandments
to
seek
his
god
he
did
it
with
all
his
heart
and
prospered
32
1
after
these
things
and
the
establishment
thereof
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
came
and
entered
into
judah
and
encamped
against
the
fenced
cities
and
thought
to
win
them
for
himself
32
2
and
when
hezekiah
saw
that
sennacherib
was
come
and
that
he
was
purposed
to
fight
against
jerusalem
32
3
he
took
counsel
with
his
princes
and
his
mighty
men
to
stop
the
waters
of
the
fountains
which
were
without
the
city
and
they
did
help
him
32
4
so
there
was
gathered
much
people
together
who
stopped
all
the
fountains
and
the
brook
that
ran
through
the
midst
of
the
land
saying
why
should
the
kings
of
assyria
come
and
find
much
water
32
5
also
he
strengthened
himself
and
built
up
all
the
wall
that
was
broken
and
raised
it
up
to
the
towers
and
another
wall
without
and
repaired
millo
in
the
city
of
david
and
made
darts
and
shields
in
abundance
32
6
and
he
set
captains
of
war
over
the
people
and
gathered
them
together
to
him
in
the
street
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
spake
comfortably
to
them
saying
32
7
be
strong
and
courageous
be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
for
the
king
of
assyria
nor
for
all
the
multitude
that
is
with
him
for
there
be
more
with
us
than
with
him
32
8
with
him
is
an
arm
of
flesh
but
with
us
is
the
lord
our
god
to
help
us
and
to
fight
our
battles
and
the
people
rested
themselves
upon
the
words
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
32
9
after
this
did
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
send
his
servants
to
jerusalem
(but
he
himself
laid
siege
against
lachish
and
all
his
power
with
him
)
unto
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
unto
all
judah
that
were
at
jerusalem
saying
32
10
thus
saith
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
whereon
do
ye
trust
that
ye
abide
in
the
siege
in
jerusalem
32
11
doth
not
hezekiah
persuade
you
to
give
over
yourselves
to
die
by
famine
and
by
thirst
saying
the
lord
our
god
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
32
12
hath
not
the
same
hezekiah
taken
away
his
high
places
and
his
altars
and
commanded
judah
and
jerusalem
saying
ye
shall
worship
before
one
altar
and
burn
incense
upon
it
32
13
know
ye
not
what
i
and
my
fathers
have
done
unto
all
the
people
of
other
lands
were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
those
lands
any
ways
able
to
deliver
their
lands
out
of
mine
hand
32
14
who
was
there
among
all
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
my
fathers
utterly
destroyed
that
could
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
that
your
god
should
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand
32
15
now
therefore
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
nor
persuade
you
on
this
manner
neither
yet
believe
him
for
no
god
of
any
nation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
and
out
of
the
hand
of
my
fathers
how
much
less
shall
your
god
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand
32
16
and
his
servants
spake
yet
more
against
the
lord
god
and
against
his
servant
hezekiah
32
17
he
wrote
also
letters
to
rail
on
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
to
speak
against
him
saying
as
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
have
not
delivered
their
people
out
of
mine
hand
so
shall
not
the
god
of
hezekiah
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
32
18
then
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews’
speech
unto
the
people
of
jerusalem
that
were
on
the
wall
to
affright
them
and
to
trouble
them
that
they
might
take
the
city
32
19
and
they
spake
against
the
god
of
jerusalem
as
against
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
earth
which
were
the
work
of
the
hands
of
man
32
20
and
for
this
cause
hezekiah
the
king
and
the
prophet
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
prayed
and
cried
to
heaven
32
21
and
the
lord
sent
an
angel
which
cut
off
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
the
leaders
and
captains
in
the
camp
of
the
king
of
assyria
so
he
returned
with
shame
of
face
to
his
own
land
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
of
his
god
they
that
came
forth
of
his
own
bowels
slew
him
there
with
the
sword
32
22
thus
the
lord
saved
hezekiah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
from
the
hand
of
sennacherib
the
king
of
assyria
and
from
the
hand
of
all
other
and
guided
them
on
every
side
32
23
and
many
brought
gifts
unto
the
lord
to
jerusalem
and
presents
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
so
that
he
was
magnified
in
the
sight
of
all
nations
from
thenceforth
32
24
in
those
days
hezekiah
was
sick
to
the
death
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
he
spake
unto
him
and
he
gave
him
a
sign
32
25
but
hezekiah
rendered
not
again
according
to
the
benefit
done
unto
him
for
his
heart
was
lifted
up
therefore
there
was
wrath
upon
him
and
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
32
26
notwithstanding
hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
pride
of
his
heart
both
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
so
that
the
wrath
of
the
lord
came
not
upon
them
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
32
27
and
hezekiah
had
exceeding
much
riches
and
honour
and
he
made
himself
treasuries
for
silver
and
for
gold
and
for
precious
stones
and
for
spices
and
for
shields
and
for
all
manner
of
pleasant
jewels
32
28
storehouses
also
for
the
increase
of
corn
and
wine
and
oil
and
stalls
for
all
manner
of
beasts
and
cotes
for
flocks
32
29
moreover
he
provided
him
cities
and
possessions
of
flocks
and
herds
in
abundance
for
god
had
given
him
substance
very
much
32
30
this
same
hezekiah
also
stopped
the
upper
watercourse
of
gihon
and
brought
it
straight
down
to
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
david
and
hezekiah
prospered
in
all
his
works
32
31
howbeit
in
the
business
of
the
ambassadors
of
the
princes
of
babylon
who
sent
unto
him
to
enquire
of
the
wonder
that
was
done
in
the
land
god
left
him
to
try
him
that
he
might
know
all
that
was
in
his
heart
32
32
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
hezekiah
and
his
goodness
behold
they
are
written
in
the
vision
of
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
and
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
32
33
and
hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
chiefest
of
the
sepulchres
of
the
sons
of
david
and
all
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
did
him
honour
at
his
death
and
manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
33
1
manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
33
2
but
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
unto
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
33
3
for
he
built
again
the
high
places
which
hezekiah
his
father
had
broken
down
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
baalim
and
made
groves
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
them
33
4
also
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
lord
whereof
the
lord
had
said
in
jerusalem
shall
my
name
be
for
ever
33
5
and
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
33
6
and
he
caused
his
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
also
he
observed
times
and
used
enchantments
and
used
witchcraft
and
dealt
with
a
familiar
spirit
and
with
wizards
he
wrought
much
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
33
7
and
he
set
a
carved
image
the
idol
which
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
god
of
which
god
had
said
to
david
and
to
solomon
his
son
in
this
house
and
in
jerusalem
which
i
have
chosen
before
all
the
tribes
of
israel
will
i
put
my
name
for
ever
33
8
neither
will
i
any
more
remove
the
foot
of
israel
from
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
appointed
for
your
fathers
so
that
they
will
take
heed
to
do
all
that
i
have
commanded
them
according
to
the
whole
law
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
by
the
hand
of
moses
33
9
so
manasseh
made
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
err
and
to
do
worse
than
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
destroyed
before
the
children
of
israel
33
10
and
the
lord
spake
to
manasseh
and
to
his
people
but
they
would
not
hearken
33
11
wherefore
the
lord
brought
upon
them
the
captains
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
assyria
which
took
manasseh
among
the
thorns
and
bound
him
with
fetters
and
carried
him
to
babylon
33
12
and
when
he
was
in
affliction
he
besought
the
lord
his
god
and
humbled
himself
greatly
before
the
god
of
his
fathers
33
13
and
prayed
unto
him
and
he
was
intreated
of
him
and
heard
his
supplication
and
brought
him
again
to
jerusalem
into
his
kingdom
then
manasseh
knew
that
the
lord
he
was
god
33
14
now
after
this
he
built
a
wall
without
the
city
of
david
on
the
west
side
of
gihon
in
the
valley
even
to
the
entering
in
at
the
fish
gate
and
compassed
about
ophel
and
raised
it
up
a
very
great
height
and
put
captains
of
war
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
33
15
and
he
took
away
the
strange
gods
and
the
idol
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
altars
that
he
had
built
in
the
mount
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
jerusalem
and
cast
them
out
of
the
city
33
16
and
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
lord
and
sacrificed
thereon
peace
offerings
and
thank
offerings
and
commanded
judah
to
serve
the
lord
god
of
israel
33
17
nevertheless
the
people
did
sacrifice
still
in
the
high
places
yet
unto
the
lord
their
god
only
33
18
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
manasseh
and
his
prayer
unto
his
god
and
the
words
of
the
seers
that
spake
to
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
33
19
his
prayer
also
and
how
god
was
intreated
of
him
and
all
his
sins
and
his
trespass
and
the
places
wherein
he
built
high
places
and
set
up
groves
and
graven
images
before
he
was
humbled
behold
they
are
written
among
the
sayings
of
the
seers
33
20
so
manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own
house
and
amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
33
21
amon
was
two
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
two
years
in
jerusalem
33
22
but
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
did
manasseh
his
father
for
amon
sacrificed
unto
all
the
carved
images
which
manasseh
his
father
had
made
and
served
them
33
23
and
humbled
not
himself
before
the
lord
as
manasseh
his
father
had
humbled
himself
but
amon
trespassed
more
and
more
33
24
and
his
servants
conspired
against
him
and
slew
him
in
his
own
house
33
25
but
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
amon
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead
34
1
josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
in
jerusalem
one
and
thirty
years
34
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
david
his
father
and
declined
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
34
3
for
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign
while
he
was
yet
young
he
began
to
seek
after
the
god
of
david
his
father
and
in
the
twelfth
year
he
began
to
purge
judah
and
jerusalem
from
the
high
places
and
the
groves
and
the
carved
images
and
the
molten
images
34
4
and
they
brake
down
the
altars
of
baalim
in
his
presence
and
the
images
that
were
on
high
above
them
he
cut
down
and
the
groves
and
the
carved
images
and
the
molten
images
he
brake
in
pieces
and
made
dust
of
them
and
strowed
it
upon
the
graves
of
them
that
had
sacrificed
unto
them
34
5
and
he
burnt
the
bones
of
the
priests
upon
their
altars
and
cleansed
judah
and
jerusalem
34
6
and
so
did
he
in
the
cities
of
manasseh
and
ephraim
and
simeon
even
unto
naphtali
with
their
mattocks
round
about
34
7
and
when
he
had
broken
down
the
altars
and
the
groves
and
had
beaten
the
graven
images
into
powder
and
cut
down
all
the
idols
throughout
all
the
land
of
israel
he
returned
to
jerusalem
34
8
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
when
he
had
purged
the
land
and
the
house
he
sent
shaphan
the
son
of
azaliah
and
maaseiah
the
governor
of
the
city
and
joah
the
son
of
joahaz
the
recorder
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
his
god
34
9
and
when
they
came
to
hilkiah
the
high
priest
they
delivered
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
god
which
the
levites
that
kept
the
doors
had
gathered
of
the
hand
of
manasseh
and
ephraim
and
of
all
the
remnant
of
israel
and
of
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
they
returned
to
jerusalem
34
10
and
they
put
it
in
the
hand
of
the
workmen
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
gave
it
to
the
workmen
that
wrought
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
repair
and
amend
the
house
34
11
even
to
the
artificers
and
builders
gave
they
it
to
buy
hewn
stone
and
timber
for
couplings
and
to
floor
the
houses
which
the
kings
of
judah
had
destroyed
34
12
and
the
men
did
the
work
faithfully
and
the
overseers
of
them
were
jahath
and
obadiah
the
levites
of
the
sons
of
merari
and
zechariah
and
meshullam
of
the
sons
of
the
kohathites
to
set
it
forward
and
other
of
the
levites
all
that
could
skill
of
instruments
of
musick
34
13
also
they
were
over
the
bearers
of
burdens
and
were
overseers
of
all
that
wrought
the
work
in
any
manner
of
service
and
of
the
levites
there
were
scribes
and
officers
and
porters
34
14
and
when
they
brought
out
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
hilkiah
the
priest
found
a
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
given
by
moses
34
15
and
hilkiah
answered
and
said
to
shaphan
the
scribe
i
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hilkiah
delivered
the
book
to
shaphan
34
16
and
shaphan
carried
the
book
to
the
king
and
brought
the
king
word
back
again
saying
all
that
was
committed
to
thy
servants
they
do
it
34
17
and
they
have
gathered
together
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
the
overseers
and
to
the
hand
of
the
workmen
34
18
then
shaphan
the
scribe
told
the
king
saying
hilkiah
the
priest
hath
given
me
a
book
and
shaphan
read
it
before
the
king
34
19
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
law
that
he
rent
his
clothes
34
20
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
and
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
abdon
the
son
of
micah
and
shaphan
the
scribe
and
asaiah
a
servant
of
the
king’s
saying
34
21
go
enquire
of
the
lord
for
me
and
for
them
that
are
left
in
israel
and
in
judah
concerning
the
words
of
the
book
that
is
found
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
lord
that
is
poured
out
upon
us
because
our
fathers
have
not
kept
the
word
of
the
lord
to
do
after
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
34
22
and
hilkiah
and
they
that
the
king
had
appointed
went
to
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
the
son
of
tikvath
the
son
of
hasrah
keeper
of
the
wardrobe
(now
she
dwelt
in
jerusalem
in
the
college
)
and
they
spake
to
her
to
that
effect
34
23
and
she
answered
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
tell
ye
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me
34
24
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
the
book
which
they
have
read
before
the
king
of
judah
34
25
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place
and
shall
not
be
quenched
34
26
and
as
for
the
king
of
judah
who
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
lord
so
shall
ye
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
concerning
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
34
27
because
thine
heart
was
tender
and
thou
didst
humble
thyself
before
god
when
thou
heardest
his
words
against
this
place
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
humbledst
thyself
before
me
and
didst
rend
thy
clothes
and
weep
before
me
i
have
even
heard
thee
also
saith
the
lord
34
28
behold
i
will
gather
thee
to
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
to
thy
grave
in
peace
neither
shall
thine
eyes
see
all
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
so
they
brought
the
king
word
again
34
29
then
the
king
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
judah
and
jerusalem
34
30
and
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
the
people
great
and
small
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
34
31
and
the
king
stood
in
his
place
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
to
walk
after
the
lord
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
to
perform
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
are
written
in
this
book
34
32
and
he
caused
all
that
were
present
in
jerusalem
and
benjamin
to
stand
to
it
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
did
according
to
the
covenant
of
god
the
god
of
their
fathers
34
33
and
josiah
took
away
all
the
abominations
out
of
all
the
countries
that
pertained
to
the
children
of
israel
and
made
all
that
were
present
in
israel
to
serve
even
to
serve
the
lord
their
god
and
all
his
days
they
departed
not
from
following
the
lord
the
god
of
their
fathers
35
1
moreover
josiah
kept
a
passover
unto
the
lord
in
jerusalem
and
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month
35
2
and
he
set
the
priests
in
their
charges
and
encouraged
them
to
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
35
3
and
said
unto
the
levites
that
taught
all
israel
which
were
holy
unto
the
lord
put
the
holy
ark
in
the
house
which
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
of
israel
did
build
it
shall
not
be
a
burden
upon
your
shoulders
serve
now
the
lord
your
god
and
his
people
israel
35
4
and
prepare
yourselves
by
the
houses
of
your
fathers
after
your
courses
according
to
the
writing
of
david
king
of
israel
and
according
to
the
writing
of
solomon
his
son
35
5
and
stand
in
the
holy
place
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
families
of
the
fathers
of
your
brethren
the
people
and
after
the
division
of
the
families
of
the
levites
35
6
so
kill
the
passover
and
sanctify
yourselves
and
prepare
your
brethren
that
they
may
do
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
moses
35
7
and
josiah
gave
to
the
people
of
the
flock
lambs
and
kids
all
for
the
passover
offerings
for
all
that
were
present
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
and
three
thousand
bullocks
these
were
of
the
king’s
substance
35
8
and
his
princes
gave
willingly
unto
the
people
to
the
priests
and
to
the
levites
hilkiah
and
zechariah
and
jehiel
rulers
of
the
house
of
god
gave
unto
the
priests
for
the
passover
offerings
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
small
cattle
and
three
hundred
oxen
35
9
conaniah
also
and
shemaiah
and
nethaneel
his

and
hashabiah
and
jeiel
and
jozabad
chief
of
the
levites
gave
unto
the
levites
for
passover
offerings
five
thousand
small
cattle
and
five
hundred
oxen
35
10
so
the
service
was
prepared
and
the
priests
stood
in
their
place
and
the
levites
in
their
courses
according
to
the
king’s
commandment
35
11
and
they
killed
the
passover
and
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
from
their
hands
and
the
levites
flayed
them
35
12
and
they
removed
the
burnt
offerings
that
they
might
give
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
families
of
the
people
to
offer
unto
the
lord
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
moses
and
so
did
they
with
the
oxen
35
13
and
they
roasted
the
passover
with
fire
according
to
the
ordinance
but
the
other
holy
offerings
sod
they
in
pots
and
in
caldrons
and
in
pans
and
divided
them
speedily
among
all
the
people
35
14
and
afterward
they
made
ready
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
because
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
were
busied
in
offering
of
burnt
offerings
and
the
fat
until
night
therefore
the
levites
prepared
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
35
15
and
the
singers
the
sons
of
asaph
were
in
their
place
according
to
the
commandment
of
david
and
asaph
and
heman
and
jeduthun
the
king’s

and
the
porters
waited
at
every
gate
they
might
not
depart
from
their
service
for
their
brethren
the
levites
prepared
for
them
35
16
so
all
the
service
of
the
lord
was
prepared
the
same
day
to
keep
the
passover
and
to
offer
burnt
offerings
upon

according
to

commandment
of
king
josiah
35
17
and
the
children
of
israel
that
were
present
kept
the
passover
at
that
time
and
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
35
18
and
there
was
no
passover
like
to
that
kept
in
israel
from
the
days
of
samuel
the
prophet
neither
did
all
the
kings
of
israel
keep
such
a
passover
as
josiah
kept
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
judah
and
israel
that
were
present
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
35
19
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
josiah
was
this
passover
kept
35
20
after
all
this
when
josiah
had
prepared
the
temple
necho
king
of
egypt
came
up
to
fight
against
charchemish
by
euphrates
and
josiah
went
out
against
him
35
21
but
he
sent
ambassadors
to
him
saying
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
thou
king
of
judah
i
come
not
against
thee
this
day
but
against
the
house
wherewith
i
have
war
for
god
commanded
me
to
make
haste
forbear
thee
from
meddling
with
god
who
is
with
me
that
he
destroy
thee
not
35
22
nevertheless
josiah
would
not
turn
his
face
from
him
but
disguised
himself
that
he
might
fight
with
him
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
necho
from
the
mouth
of
god
and
came
to
fight
in
the
valley
of
megiddo
35
23
and
the
archers
shot
at
king
josiah
and
the
king
said
to
his
servants
have
me
away
for
i
am
sore
wounded
35
24
his
servants
therefore
took
him
out
of
that
chariot
and
put
him
in
the
second
chariot
that
he
had
and
they
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
he
died
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
sepulchres
of
his
fathers
and
all
judah
and
jerusalem
mourned
for
josiah
35
25
and
jeremiah
lamented
for
josiah
and
all
the
singing
men
and
the
singing
women
spake
of
josiah
in
their
lamentations
to
this
day
and
made
them
an
ordinance
in
israel
and
behold
they
are
written
in
the
lamentations
35
26
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
josiah
and
his
goodness
according
to
that
which
was
written
in
the
law
of
the
lord
35
27
and
his
deeds
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
36
1
then
the
people
of
the
land
took
jehoahaz
the
son
of
josiah
and
made
him
king
in
his
father’s
stead
in
jerusalem
36
2
jehoahaz
was
twenty
and
three
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
three
months
in
jerusalem
36
3
and
the
king
of
egypt
put
him
down
at
jerusalem
and
condemned
the
land
in
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
a
talent
of
gold
36
4
and
the
king
of
egypt
made
eliakim
his
brother
king
over
judah
and
jerusalem
and
turned
his
name
to
jehoiakim
and
necho
took
jehoahaz
his
brother
and
carried
him
to
egypt
36
5
jehoiakim
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
jerusalem
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
his
god
36
6
against
him
came
up
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
bound
him
in
fetters
to
carry
him
to
babylon
36
7
nebuchadnezzar
also
carried
of
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
lord
to
babylon
and
put
them
in
his
temple
at
babylon
36
8
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoiakim
and
his
abominations
which
he
did
and
that
which
was
found
in
him
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
and
jehoiachin
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
36
9
jehoiachin
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
three
months
and
ten
days
in
jerusalem
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
36
10
and
when
the
year
was
expired
king
nebuchadnezzar
sent
and
brought
him
to
babylon
with
the
goodly
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
made
zedekiah
his
brother
king
over
judah
and
jerusalem
36
11
zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
eleven
years
in
jerusalem
36
12
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
his
god
and
humbled
not
himself
before
jeremiah
the
prophet
speaking
from
the
mouth
of
the
lord
36
13
and
he
also
rebelled
against
king
nebuchadnezzar
who
had
made
him
swear
by
god
but
he
stiffened
his
neck
and
hardened
his
heart
from
turning
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
36
14
moreover
all
the
chief
of
the
priests
and
the
people
transgressed
very
much
after
all
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
and
polluted
the
house
of
the
lord
which
he
had
hallowed
in
jerusalem
36
15
and
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
sent
to
them
by
his
messengers
rising
up
betimes
and
sending
because
he
had
compassion
on
his
people
and
on
his
dwelling
place
36
16
but
they
mocked
the
messengers
of
god
and
despised
his
words
and
misused
his
prophets
until
the
wrath
of
the
lord
arose
against
his
people
till
there
was
no
remedy
36
17
therefore
he
brought
upon
them
the
king
of
the
chaldees
who
slew
their
young
men
with
the
sword
in
the
house
of
their
sanctuary
and
had
no
compassion
upon
young
man
or
maiden
old
man
or
him
that
stooped
for
age
he
gave
them
all
into
his
hand
36
18
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
great
and
small
and
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king
and
of
his
princes
all
these
he
brought
to
babylon
36
19
and
they
burnt
the
house
of
god
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
jerusalem
and
burnt
all
the
palaces
thereof
with
fire
and
destroyed
all
the
goodly
vessels
thereof
36
20
and
them
that
had
escaped
from
the
sword
carried
he
away
to
babylon
where
they
were
servants
to
him
and
his
sons
until
the
reign
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
36
21
to
fulfil
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
until
the
land
had
enjoyed
her
sabbaths
for
as
long
as
she
lay
desolate
she
kept
sabbath
to
fulfil
threescore
and
ten
years
36
22
now
in
the
first
year
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
the
word
of
the
lord
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
might
be
accomplished
the
lord
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
he
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
his
kingdom
and
put
it
also
in
writing
saying
36
23
thus
saith
cyrus
king
of
persia
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
hath
the
lord
god
of
heaven
given
me
and
he
hath
charged
me
to
build
him
an
house
in
jerusalem
which
is
in
judah
who
is
there
among
you
of
all
his
people
the
lord
his
god
be
with
him
and
let
him
go
up
ezra
1
1
now
in
the
first
year
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
might
be
fulfilled
the
lord
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
he
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
his
kingdom
and
put
it
also
in
writing
saying
1
2
thus
saith
cyrus
king
of
persia
the
lord
god
of
heaven
hath
given
me
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
he
hath
charged
me
to
build
him
an
house
at
jerusalem
which
is
in
judah
1
3
who
is
there
among
you
of
all
his
people
his
god
be
with
him
and
let
him
go
up
to
jerusalem
which
is
in
judah
and
build
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
(he
is
the
god
)
which
is
in
jerusalem
1
4
and
whosoever
remaineth
in
any
place
where
he
sojourneth
let
the
men
of
his
place
help
him
with
silver
and
with
gold
and
with
goods
and
with
beasts
beside
the
freewill
offering
for
the
house
of
god
that
is
in
jerusalem
1
5
then
rose
up
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
with
all
them
whose
spirit
god
had
raised
to
go
up
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
which
is
in
jerusalem
1
6
and
all
they
that
were
about
them
strengthened
their
hands
with
vessels
of
silver
with
gold
with
goods
and
with
beasts
and
with
precious
things
beside
all
that
was
willingly
offered
1
7
also
cyrus
the
king
brought
forth
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
lord
which
nebuchadnezzar
had
brought
forth
out
of
jerusalem
and
had
put
them
in
the
house
of
his
gods
1
8
even
those
did
cyrus
king
of
persia
bring
forth
by
the
hand
of
mithredath
the
treasurer
and
numbered
them
unto
sheshbazzar
the
prince
of

all
these
did
sheshbazzar
bring
up
with

were
brought
up

and
they
set

from

but
the

was
not

they

now

from

years
old
and
upward
to
set
forward
the

of
the

then
stood

together
to

in
the
house
of
god
the
sons
of
henadad
with
their
sons
and
their
brethren
the
levites
3
10
and
when
the
builders
laid
the
foundation
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
they
set
the
priests
in
their
apparel
with
trumpets
and
the
levites
the
sons
of
asaph
with
cymbals
to
praise
the
lord
after
the
ordinance
of
david
king
of
israel
3
11
and
they
sang
together
by
course
in
praising
and
giving
thanks
unto
the
lord
because
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
toward
israel
and
all
the
people
shouted
with
a
great
shout
when
they
praised
the
lord
because
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
lord
was
laid
3
12
but
many
of
the
priests
and
levites
and
chief
of
the
fathers
who
were
ancient
men
that
had
seen
the
first
house
when
the
foundation
of
this
house
was
laid
before
their
eyes
wept
with
a
loud
voice
and
many
shouted
aloud
for
joy
3
13
so
that
the
people
could
not
discern
the
noise
of
the
shout
of
joy
from
the
noise
of
the
weeping
of
the
people
for
the
people
shouted
with
a
loud
shout
and
the
noise
was
heard
afar
off
4
1
now
when
the
adversaries
of
judah
and
benjamin
heard
that
the
children
of
the
captivity
builded
the
temple
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
4
2
then
they
came
to
zerubbabel
and
to
the
chief
of
the
fathers
and
said
unto
them
let
us
build
with
you
for
we
seek
your
god
as
ye
do
and
we
do
sacrifice
unto
him
since
the
days
of
esarhaddon
king
of
assur
which
brought
us
up
hither
4
3
but
zerubbabel
and
jeshua
and
the
rest
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
said
unto
them
ye
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
to
build
an
house
unto
our
god
but
we
ourselves
together
will
build
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
as
king
cyrus
the
king
of
persia
hath
commanded
us
4
4
then
the
people
of
the
land
weakened
the
hands
of
the
people
of
judah
and
troubled
them
in
building
4
5
and
hired
counsellors
against
them
to
frustrate
their
purpose
all
the
days
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
even
until
the
reign
of
darius
king
of
persia
4
6
and
in
the
reign
of
ahasuerus
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
wrote
they
unto
him
an
accusation
against
the
inhabitants
of
judah
and
jerusalem
4
7
and
in
the
days
of
artaxerxes
wrote
bishlam
mithredath
tabeel
and
the
rest
of
their
companions
unto
artaxerxes
king
of
persia
and
the
writing
of
the
letter
was
written
in
the
syrian
tongue
and
interpreted
in
the
syrian
tongue
4
8
rehum
the
chancellor
and
shimshai
the
scribe
wrote
a
letter
against
jerusalem
to
artaxerxes
the
king
in
this
sort
4
9
then
wrote
rehum
the
chancellor
and
shimshai
the
scribe
and
the
rest
of
their
companions
the
dinaites
the
apharsathchites
the
tarpelites
the
apharsites
the
archevites
the
babylonians
the
susanchites
the
dehavites
and
the
elamites
4
10
and
the
rest
of
the
nations
whom
the
great
and
noble
asnapper
brought
over
and
set
in
the
cities
of
samaria
and
the
rest
that
are
on
this
side
the
river
and
at
such
a
time
4
11
this
is
the
copy
of
the
letter
that
they
sent
unto
him
even
unto
artaxerxes
the
king
thy
servants
the
men
on
this
side
the
river
and
at
such
a
time
4
12
be
it
known
unto
the
king
that
the
jews
which
came
up
from
thee
to
us
are
come
unto
jerusalem
building
the
rebellious
and
the
bad
city
and
have
set
up
the
walls
thereof
and
joined
the
foundations
4
13
be
it
known
now
unto
the
king
that
if
this
city
be
builded
and
the
walls
set
up
again
then
will
they
not
pay
toll
tribute
and
custom
and
so
thou
shalt
endamage
the
revenue
of
the
kings
4
14
now
because
we
have
maintenance
from
the
king’s
palace
and
it
was
not
meet
for
us
to
see
the
king’s
dishonour
therefore
have
we
sent
and
certified
the
king
4
15
that
search
may
be
made
in
the
book
of
the
records
of
thy
fathers
so
shalt
thou
find
in
the
book
of
the
records
and
know
that
this
city
is
a
rebellious
city
and
hurtful
unto
kings
and
provinces
and
that
they
have
moved
sedition
within
the
same
of
old
time
for
which
cause
was
this
city
destroyed
4
16
we
certify
the
king
that
if
this
city
be
builded
again
and
the
walls
thereof
set
up
by
this
means
thou
shalt
have
no
portion
on
this
side
the
river
4
17
then
sent
the
king
an
answer
unto
rehum
the
chancellor
and
to
shimshai
the
scribe
and
to
the
rest
of
their
companions
that
dwell
in
samaria
and
unto
the
rest
beyond
the
river
peace
and
at
such
a
time
4
18
the
letter
which
ye
sent
unto
us
hath
been
plainly
read
before
me
4
19
and
i
commanded
and
search
hath
been
made
and
it
is
found
that
this
city
of
old
time
hath
made
insurrection
against
kings
and
that
rebellion
and
sedition
have
been
made
therein
4
20
there
have
been
mighty
kings
also
over
jerusalem
which
have
ruled
over
all
countries
beyond
the
river
and
toll
tribute
and
custom
was
paid
unto
them
4
21
give
ye
now
commandment
to
cause
these
men
to
cease
and
that
this
city
be
not
builded
until
another
commandment
shall
be
given
from
me
4
22
take
heed
now
that
ye
fail
not
to
do
this
why
should
damage
grow
to
the
hurt
of
the
kings
4
23
now
when
the
copy
of
king
artaxerxes’
letter
was
read
before
rehum
and
shimshai
the
scribe
and
their
companions
they
went
up
in
haste
to
jerusalem
unto
the
jews
and
made
them
to
cease
by
force
and
power
4
24
then
ceased
the
work
of
the
house
of
god
which
is
at
jerusalem
so
it
ceased
unto
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
darius
king
of
persia
5
1
then
the
prophets
haggai
the
prophet
and
zechariah
the
son
of
iddo
prophesied
unto
the
jews
that
were
in
judah
and
jerusalem
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
israel
even
unto
them
5
2
then
rose
up
zerubbabel
the
son
of
shealtiel
and
jeshua
the
son
of
jozadak
and
began
to
build
the
house
of
god
which
is
at
jerusalem
and
with
them
were
the
prophets
of
god
helping
them
5
3
at
the
same
time
came
to
them
tatnai
governor
on
this
side
the
river
and
shetharboznai
and
their
companions
and
said
thus
unto
them
who
hath
commanded
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
make
up
this
wall
5
4
then
said
we
unto
them
after
this
manner
what
are
the
names
of
the
men
that
make
this
building
5
5
but
the
eye
of
their
god
was
upon
the
elders
of
the
jews
that
they
could
not
cause
them
to
cease
till
the
matter
came
to
darius
and
then
they
returned
answer
by
letter
concerning
this
matter
5
6
the
copy
of
the
letter
that
tatnai
governor
on
this
side
the
river
and
shetharboznai
and
his
companions
the
apharsachites
which
were
on
this
side
the
river
sent
unto
darius
the
king
5
7
they
sent
a
letter
unto
him
wherein
was
written
thus
unto
darius
the
king
all
peace
5
8
be
it
known
unto
the
king
that
we
went
into
the
province
of
judea
to
the
house
of
the
great
god
which
is
builded
with
great
stones
and
timber
is
laid
in
the
walls
and
this
work
goeth
fast
on
and
prospereth
in
their
hands
5
9
then
asked
we
those
elders
and
said
unto
them
thus
who
commanded
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
make
up
these
walls
5
10
we
asked
their
names
also
to
certify
thee
that
we
might
write
the
names
of
the
men
that
were
the
chief
of
them
5
11
and
thus
they
returned
us
answer
saying
we
are
the
servants
of
the
god
of
heaven
and
earth
and
build
the
house
that
was
builded
these
many
years
ago
which
a
great
king
of
israel
builded
and
set
up
5
12
but
after
that
our
fathers
had
provoked
the
god
of
heaven
unto
wrath
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
the
chaldean
who
destroyed
this
house
and
carried
the
people
away
into
babylon
5
13
but
in
the
first
year
of
cyrus
the
king
of
babylon
the
same
king
cyrus
made
a
decree
to
build
this
house
of
god
5
14
and
the
vessels
also
of
gold
and
silver
of
the
house
of
god
which
nebuchadnezzar
took
out
of
the
temple
that
was
in
jerusalem
and
brought
them
into
the
temple
of
babylon
those
did
cyrus
the
king
take
out
of
the
temple
of
babylon
and
they
were
delivered
unto
one
whose
name
was
sheshbazzar
whom
he
had
made
governor
5
15
and
said
unto
him
take
these
vessels
go
carry
them
into
the
temple
that
is
in
jerusalem
and
let
the
house
of
god
be
builded
in
his
place
5
16
then
came
the
same
sheshbazzar
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
god
which
is
in
jerusalem
and
since
that
time
even
until
now
hath
it
been
in
building
and
yet
it
is
not
finished
5
17
now
therefore
if
it
seem
good
to
the
king
let
there
be
search
made
in
the
king’s
treasure
house
which
is
there
at
babylon
whether
it
be
so
that
a
decree
was
made
of
cyrus
the
king
to
build
this
house
of
god
at
jerusalem
and
let
the
king
send
his
pleasure
to
us
concerning
this
matter
6
1
then
darius
the
king
made
a
decree
and
search
was
made
in
the
house
of

where
the

were
laid

with

of

and
a

and
let

and
also
let

and
i
sent

i
told

what
they
should
say
unto

the

at
the
place
casiphia
that
they
should
bring
unto

ministers
for
the
house
of
our
god
8
18
and
by
the
good
hand
of
our
god
upon
us
they
brought
us
a
man
of
understanding
of
the
sons
of
mahli
the

the

two
hundred
and
twenty
nethinims
all
of
them
were
expressed
by
name
8
21
then
i
proclaimed
a
fast
there
at
the
river
of
ahava
that
we
might
afflict
ourselves
before
our
god
to
seek
of
him
a
right
way
for
us
and
for
our
little
ones
and
for
all
our
substance
8
22
for
i
was
ashamed
to
require
of
the
king
a
band
of
soldiers
and
horsemen
to
help
us
against
the
enemy
in
the
way
because
we
had
spoken
unto
the
king
saying
the
hand
of
our
god
is
upon
all
them
for
good
that
seek
him
but
his
power
and
his
wrath
is
against
all
them
that
forsake
him
8
23
so
we
fasted
and
besought
our
god
for
this
and
he
was
intreated
of
us
8
24
then
i
separated
twelve
of
the
chief
of
the
priests
sherebiah
hashabiah
and
ten
of
their
brethren
with
them
8
25
and
weighed
unto
them
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
even
the
offering
of
the
house
of
our
god
which
the
king
and
his
counsellors
and
his
lords
and
all
israel
there
present
had
offered
8
26
i
even
weighed
unto
their
hand
six
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
silver
and
silver
vessels
an
hundred
talents
and
of
gold
an
hundred
talents
8
27
also
twenty
basons
of
gold
of
a
thousand
drams
and
two
vessels
of
fine
copper
precious
as
gold
8
28
and
i
said
unto
them
ye
are
holy
unto
the
lord
the
vessels
are
holy
also
and
the
silver
and
the
gold
are
a
freewill
offering
unto
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
8
29
watch
ye
and
keep
them
until
ye
weigh
them
before
the
chief
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
at
jerusalem
in
the
chambers
of
the
house
of
the
lord
8
30
so
took
the
priests
and
the
levites
the
weight
of
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
to
bring
them
to
jerusalem
unto
the
house
of
our
god
8
31
then
we
departed
from
the
river
of
ahava
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
first
month
to
go
unto
jerusalem
and
the
hand
of
our
god
was
upon
us
and
he
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
of
such
as
lay
in
wait
by
the
way
8
32
and
we
came
to
jerusalem
and
abode
there
three
days
8
33
now
on
the
fourth
day
was
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
weighed
in
the
house
of
our
god
by
the
hand
of
meremoth
the
son
of
uriah
the
priest
and
with
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
phinehas
and
with
them
was
jozabad
the
son
of
jeshua
and
noadiah
the
son
of
binnui
levites
8
34
by
number
and
by
weight
of
every
one
and
all
the
weight
was
written
at
that
time
8
35
also
the
children
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
which
were
come
out
of
the
captivity
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
god
of
israel
twelve
bullocks
for
all
israel
ninety
and
six
rams
seventy
and
seven
lambs
twelve
he
goats
for
a
sin
offering
all
this
was
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
8
36
and
they
delivered
the
king’s
commissions
unto
the
king’s
lieutenants
and
to
the
governors
on
this
side
the
river
and
they
furthered
the
people
and
the
house
of
god
9
1
now
when
these
things
were
done
the
princes
came
to
me
saying
the
people
of
israel
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
have
not
separated
themselves
from
the
people
of
the
lands
doing
according
to
their
abominations
even
of
the
canaanites
the
hittites
the
perizzites
the
jebusites
the
ammonites
the
moabites
the
egyptians
and
the
amorites
9
2
for
they
have
taken
of
their
daughters
for
themselves
and
for
their
sons
so
that
the
holy
seed
have
mingled
themselves
with
the
people
of
those
lands
yea
the
hand
of
the
princes
and
rulers
hath
been
chief
in
this
trespass
9
3
and
when
i
heard
this
thing
i
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle
and
plucked
off
the
hair
of
my
head
and
of
my
beard
and
sat
down
astonied
9
4
then
were
assembled
unto
me
every
one
that
trembled
at
the
words
of
the
god
of
israel
because
of
the
transgression
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
and
i
sat
astonied
until
the
evening
sacrifice
9
5
and
at
the
evening
sacrifice
i
arose
up
from
my
heaviness
and
having
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
spread
out
my
hands
unto
the
lord
my
god
9
6
and
said
o
my
god
i
am
ashamed
and
blush
to
lift
up
my
face
to
thee
my
god
for
our
iniquities
are
increased
over
our
head
and
our
trespass
is
grown
up
unto
the
heavens
9
7
since
the
days
of
our
fathers
have
we
been
in
a
great
trespass
unto
this
day
and
for
our
iniquities
have
we
our
kings
and
our
priests
been
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
the
lands
to
the
sword
to
captivity
and
to
a
spoil
and
to
confusion
of
face
as
it
is
this
day
9
8
and
now
for
a
little
space
grace
hath
been
shewed
from
the
lord
our
god
to
leave
us
a
remnant
to
escape
and
to
give
us
a
nail
in
his
holy
place
that
our
god
may
lighten
our
eyes
and
give
us
a
little
reviving
in
our
bondage
9
9
for
we
were
bondmen
yet
our
god
hath
not
forsaken
us
in
our
bondage
but
hath
extended
mercy
unto
us
in
the
sight
of
the
kings
of
persia
to
give
us
a
reviving
to
set
up
the
house
of
our
god
and
to
repair
the
desolations
thereof
and
to
give
us
a
wall
in
judah
and
in
jerusalem
9
10
and
now
o
our
god
what
shall
we
say
after
this
for
we
have
forsaken
thy
commandments
9
11
which
thou
hast
commanded
by
thy
servants
the
prophets
saying
the
land
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
it
is
an
unclean
land
with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of
the
lands
with
their
abominations
which
have
filled
it
from
one
end
to
another
with
their
uncleanness
9
12
now
therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons
nor
seek
their
peace
or
their
wealth
for
ever
that
ye
may
be
strong
and
eat
the
good
of
the
land
and
leave
it
for
an
inheritance
to
your
children
for
ever
9
13
and
after
all
that
is
come
upon
us
for
our
evil
deeds
and
for
our
great
trespass
seeing
that
thou
our
god
hast
punished
us
less
than
our
iniquities
deserve
and
hast
given
us
such
deliverance
as
this
9
14
should
we
again
break
thy
commandments
and
join
in
affinity
with
the
people
of
these
abominations
wouldest
not
thou
be
angry
with
us
till
thou
hadst
consumed
us
so
that
there
should
be
no
remnant
nor
escaping
9
15
o
lord
god
of
israel
thou
art
righteous
for
we
remain
yet
escaped
as
it
is
this
day
behold
we
are
before
thee
in
our
trespasses
for
we
cannot
stand
before
thee
because
of
this
10
1
now
when
ezra
had
prayed
and
when
he
had
confessed
weeping
and
casting
himself
down
before
the
house
of
god
there
assembled
unto
him
out
of
israel
a
very
great
congregation
of
men
and
women
and
children
for
the
people
wept
very
sore
10
2
and
shechaniah
the
son
of
jehiel
one
of
the
sons
of
elam
answered
and
said
unto
ezra
we
have
trespassed
against
our
god
and
have
taken
strange
wives
of
the
people
of
the
land
yet
now
there
is
hope
in
israel
concerning
this
thing
10
3
now
therefore
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
our
god
to
put
away
all
the
wives
and
such
as
are
born
of
them
according
to
the
counsel
of
my
lord
and
of
those
that
tremble
at
the
commandment
of
our
god
and
let
it
be
done
according
to
the
law
10
4
arise
for
this
matter
belongeth
unto
thee
we
also
will
be
with
thee
be
of
good
courage
and
do
it
10
5
then
arose
ezra
and
made
the
chief
priests
the
levites
and
all
israel
to
swear
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
word
and
they
sware
10
6
then
ezra
rose
up
from
before
the
house
of
god
and
went
into
the
chamber
of
johanan
the
son
of
eliashib
and
when
he
came
thither
he
did
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
for
he
mourned
because
of
the
transgression
of
them
that
had
been
carried
away
10
7
and
they
made
proclamation
throughout
judah
and
jerusalem
unto
all
the
children
of
the
captivity
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
unto
jerusalem
10
8
and
that
whosoever
would
not
come
within
three
days
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
princes
and
the
elders
all
his
substance
should
be
forfeited
and
himself
separated
from
the
congregation
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
10
9
then
all
the
men
of
judah
and
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
unto
jerusalem
within
three
days
it
was
the
ninth
month
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
month
and
all
the
people
sat
in
the
street
of
the
house
of
god
trembling
because
of
this
matter
and
for
the
great
rain
10
10
and
ezra
the
priest
stood
up
and
said
unto
them
ye
have
transgressed
and
have
taken
strange
wives
to
increase
the
trespass
of
israel
10
11
now
therefore
make
confession
unto
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
and
do
his
pleasure
and
separate
yourselves
from
the
people
of
the
land
and
from
the
strange
wives
10
12
then
all
the
congregation
answered
and
said
with
a
loud
voice
as
thou
hast
said
so
must
we
do
10
13
but
the
people
are
many
and
it
is
a
time
of
much
rain
and
we
are
not
able
to
stand
without
neither
is
this
a
work
of
one
day
or
two
for
we
are
many
that
have
transgressed
in
this
thing
10
14
let
now
our
rulers
of
all
the
congregation
stand
and
let
all
them
which
have
taken
strange
wives
in
our
cities
come
at
appointed
times
and
with
them
the
elders
of
every
city
and
the
judges
thereof
until
the
fierce
wrath
of
our
god
for
this
matter
be
turned
from
us
10
15
only
jonathan
the
son
of
asahel
and
jahaziah
the
son
of
tikvah
were
employed
about
this
matter
and
meshullam
and
shabbethai
the
levite
helped
them
10
16
and
the
children
of
the
captivity
did
so
and
ezra
the
priest
with
certain
chief
of
the
fathers
after
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
all
of
them
by
their
names
were
separated
and
sat
down
in
the
first
day
of
the
tenth
month
to
examine
the
matter
10
17
and
they
made
an
end
with
all
the
men
that
had
taken
strange
wives
by
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
10
18

whom
they
had
children
the
book
of
nehemiah
1
1
the
words
of
nehemiah
the
son
of
hachaliah
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
chisleu
in
the
twentieth
year
as
i
was
in
shushan
the
palace
1
2
that
hanani
one
of
my
brethren
came
he
and
certain
men
of
judah
and
i
asked
them
concerning
the
jews
that
had
escaped
which
were
left
of
the
captivity
and
concerning
jerusalem
1
3
and
they
said
unto
me
the
remnant
that
are
left
of
the
captivity
there
in
the
province
are
in
great
affliction
and
reproach
the
wall
of
jerusalem
also
is
broken
down
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire
1
4
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
heard
these
words
that
i
sat
down
and
wept
and
mourned
certain
days
and
fasted
and
prayed
before
the
god
of
heaven
1
5
and
said
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
god
of
heaven
the
great
and
terrible
god
that
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
for
them
that
love
him
and
observe
his
commandments
1
6
let
thine
ear
now
be
attentive
and
thine
eyes
open
that
thou
mayest
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
which
i
pray
before
thee
now
day
and
night
for
the
children
of
israel
thy
servants
and
confess
the
sins
of
the
children
of
israel
which
we
have
sinned
against
thee
both
i
and
my
father’s
house
have
sinned
1
7
we
have
dealt
very
corruptly
against
thee
and
have
not
kept
the
commandments
nor
the
statutes
nor
the
judgments
which
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
moses
1
8
remember
i
beseech
thee
the
word
that
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
moses
saying
if
ye
transgress
i
will
scatter
you
abroad
among
the
nations
1
9
but
if
ye
turn
unto
me
and
keep
my
commandments
and
do
them
though
there
were
of
you
cast
out
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
heaven
yet
will
i
gather
them
from
thence
and
will
bring
them
unto
the
place
that
i
have
chosen
to
set
my
name
there
1
10
now
these
are
thy
servants
and
thy
people
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
by
thy
great
power
and
by
thy
strong
hand
1
11
o
lord
i
beseech
thee
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name
and
prosper
i
pray
thee
thy
servant
this
day
and
grant
him
mercy
in
the
sight
of
this
man
for
i
was
the
king’s
cupbearer
2
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
nisan
in
the
twentieth
year
of
artaxerxes
the
king
that
wine
was
before
him
and
i
took
up
the
wine
and
gave
it
unto
the
king
now
i
had
not
been
beforetime
sad
in
his
presence
2
2
wherefore
the
king
said
unto
me
why
is
thy
countenance
sad
seeing
thou
art
not
sick
this
is
nothing
else
but
sorrow
of
heart
then
i
was
very
sore
afraid
2
3
and
said
unto
the
king
let
the
king
live
for
ever
why
should
not
my
countenance
be
sad
when
the
city
the
place
of
my
fathers’
sepulchres
lieth
waste
and
the
gates
thereof
are
consumed
with
fire
2
4
then
the
king
said
unto
me
for
what
dost
thou
make
request
so
i
prayed
to
the
god
of
heaven
2
5
and
i
said
unto
the
king
if
it
please
the
king
and
if
thy
servant
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
that
thou
wouldest
send
me
unto
judah
unto
the
city
of
my
fathers’
sepulchres
that
i
may
build
it
2
6
and
the
king
said
unto
me
(the
queen
also
sitting
by
him
)
for
how
long
shall
thy
journey
be
and
when
wilt
thou
return
so
it
pleased
the
king
to
send
me
and
i
set
him
a
time
2
7
moreover
i
said
unto
the
king
if
it
please
the
king
let
letters
be
given
me
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river
that
they
may
convey
me
over
till
i
come
into
judah
2
8
and
a
letter
unto
asaph
the
keeper
of
the
king’s
forest
that
he
may
give
me
timber
to
make
beams
for
the
gates
of
the
palace
which
appertained
to
the
house
and
for
the
wall
of
the
city
and
for
the
house
that
i
shall
enter
into
and
the
king
granted
me
according
to
the
good
hand
of
my
god
upon
me
2
9
then
i
came
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river
and
gave
them
the
king’s
letters
now
the
king
had
sent
captains
of
the
army
and
horsemen
with
me
2
10
when
sanballat
the
horonite
and
tobiah
the
servant
the
ammonite
heard
of
it
it
grieved
them
exceedingly
that
there
was
come
a
man
to
seek
the
welfare
of
the
children
of
israel
2
11
so
i
came
to
jerusalem
and
was
there
three
days
2
12
and
i
arose
in
the
night
i
and
some
few
men
with
me
neither
told
i
any
man
what
my
god
had
put
in
my
heart
to
do
at
jerusalem
neither
was
there
any
beast
with
me
save
the
beast
that
i
rode
upon
2
13
and
i
went
out
by
night
by
the
gate
of
the
valley
even
before
the
dragon
well
and
to
the
dung
port
and
viewed
the
walls
of
jerusalem
which
were
broken
down
and
the
gates
thereof
were
consumed
with
fire
2
14
then
i
went
on
to
the
gate
of
the
fountain
and
to
the
king’s
pool
but
there
was
no
place
for
the
beast
that
was
under
me
to
pass
2
15
then
went
i
up
in
the
night
by
the
brook
and
viewed
the
wall
and
turned
back
and
entered
by
the
gate
of
the
valley
and
so
returned
2
16
and
the
rulers
knew
not
whither
i
went
or
what
i
did
neither
had
i
as
yet
told
it
to
the
jews
nor
to
the
priests
nor
to
the
nobles
nor
to
the
rulers
nor
to
the
rest
that
did
the
work
2
17
then
said
i
unto
them
ye
see
the
distress
that
we
are
in
how
jerusalem
lieth
waste
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire
come
and
let
us
build
up
the
wall
of
jerusalem
that
we
be
no
more
a
reproach
2
18
then
i
told
them
of
the
hand
of
my
god
which
was
good
upon
me
as
also
the
king’s
words
that
he
had
spoken
unto
me
and
they
said
let
us
rise
up
and
build
so
they
strengthened
their
hands
for
this
good
work

19

the
servant

it
they
laughed
us

and
despised
us
and
said
what
is
this
thing
that
ye
do
will
ye
rebel
against
the
king
2
20
then
answered
i
them
and
said
unto
them
the
god
of
heaven
he
will
prosper
us
therefore
we
his
servants
will
arise
and
build
but
ye
have
no
portion
nor
right
nor
memorial
in
jerusalem

4
1
but
it
came
to
pass
that
when
sanballat
heard
that
we
builded
the
wall
he
was
wroth
and
took
great
indignation
and
mocked
the
jews
4
2
and
he
spake
before
his
brethren
and
the
army
of
samaria
and
said
what
do
these
feeble
jews
will
they
fortify
themselves
will
they
sacrifice
will
they
make
an
end
in
a
day
will
they
revive
the
stones
out
of
the
heaps
of
the
rubbish
which
are
burned
4
3
now
tobiah
the
ammonite
was
by
him
and
he
said
even
that
which
they
build
if
a
fox
go
up
he
shall
even
break
down
their
stone
wall
4
4
hear
o
our
god
for
we
are
despised
and
turn
their
reproach
upon
their
own
head
and
give
them
for
a
prey
in
the
land
of
captivity
4
5
and
cover
not
their
iniquity
and
let
not
their
sin
be
blotted
out
from
before
thee
for
they
have
provoked
thee
to
anger
before
the
builders
4
6
so
built
we
the
wall
and
all
the
wall
was
joined
together
unto
the
half
thereof
for
the
people
had
a
mind
to
work
4
7
but
it
came
to
pass
that
when
sanballat
and
tobiah
and
the
arabians
and
the
ammonites
and
the
ashdodites
heard
that
the
walls
of
jerusalem
were
made
up
and
that
the
breaches
began
to
be
stopped
then
they
were
very
wroth
4
8
and
conspired
all
of
them
together
to
come
and
to
fight
against
jerusalem
and
to
hinder
it
4
9
nevertheless
we
made
our
prayer
unto
our
god
and
set
a
watch
against
them
day
and
night
because
of
them
4
10
and
judah
said
the
strength
of
the
bearers
of
burdens
is
decayed
and
there
is
much
rubbish
so
that
we
are
not
able
to
build
the
wall
4
11
and
our
adversaries
said
they
shall
not
know
neither
see
till
we
come
in
the
midst
among
them
and
slay
them
and
cause
the
work
to
cease
4
12
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
jews
which
dwelt
by
them
came
they
said
unto
us
ten
times
from
all
places
whence
ye
shall
return
unto
us
they
will
be
upon
you
4
13
therefore
set
i
in
the
lower
places
behind
the
wall
and
on
the
higher
places
i
even
set
the
people
after
their
families
with
their
swords
their
spears
and
their
bows
4
14
and
i
looked
and
rose
up
and
said
unto
the
nobles
and
to
the
rulers
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people
be
not
ye
afraid
of
them
remember
the
lord
which
is
great
and
terrible
and
fight
for
your
brethren
your
sons
and
your
daughters
your
wives
and
your
houses
4
15
and
it
came
to
pass
when
our
enemies
heard
that
it
was
known
unto
us
and
god
had
brought
their
counsel
to
nought
that
we
returned
all
of
us
to
the
wall
every
one
unto
his
work
4
16
and
it
came
to
pass
from
that
time
forth
that
the
half
of
my
servants
wrought
in
the
work
and
the
other
half
of
them
held
both
the
spears
the
shields
and
the
bows
and
the
habergeons
and
the
rulers
were
behind
all
the
house
of
judah
4
17
they
which
builded
on
the
wall
and
they
that
bare
burdens
with
those
that
laded
every
one
with
one
of
his
hands
wrought
in
the
work
and
with
the
other
hand
held
a
weapon
4
18
for
the
builders
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
by
his
side
and
so
builded
and
he
that
sounded
the
trumpet
was
by
me
4
19
and
i
said
unto
the
nobles
and
to
the
rulers
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people
the
work
is
great
and
large
and
we
are
separated
upon
the
wall
one
far
from
another
4
20
in
what
place
therefore
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
resort
ye
thither
unto
us
our
god
shall
fight
for
us
4
21
so
we
laboured
in
the
work
and
half
of
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
of
the
morning
till
the
stars
appeared
4
22
likewise
at
the
same
time
said
i
unto
the
people
let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
jerusalem
that
in
the
night
they
may
be
a
guard
to
us
and
labour
on
the
day
4
23
so
neither
i
nor
my
brethren
nor
my
servants
nor
the
men
of
the
guard
which
followed
me
none
of
us
put
off
our
clothes
saving
that
every
one
put
them
off
for
washing
5
1
and
there
was
a
great
cry
of
the
people
and
of
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
jews
5
2
for
there
were
that
said
we
our
sons
and
our
daughters
are
many
therefore
we
take
up
corn
for
them
that
we
may
eat
and
live
5
3
some
also
there
were
that
said
we
have
mortgaged
our
lands
vineyards
and
houses
that
we
might
buy
corn
because
of
the
dearth
5
4
there
were
also
that
said
we
have
borrowed
money
for
the
king’s
tribute
and
that
upon
our
lands
and
vineyards
5
5
yet
now
our
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
our
brethren
our
children
as
their
children
and
lo
we
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
and
our
daughters
to
be
servants
and
some
of
our
daughters
are
brought
unto
bondage
already
neither
is
it
in
our
power
to
redeem
them
for
other
men
have
our
lands
and
vineyards
5
6
and
i
was
very
angry
when
i
heard
their
cry
and
these
words
5
7
then
i
consulted
with
myself
and
i
rebuked
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
said
unto
them
ye
exact
usury
every
one
of
his
brother
and
i
set
a
great
assembly
against
them
5
8
and
i
said
unto
them
we
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
jews
which
were
sold
unto
the
heathen
and
will
ye
even
sell
your
brethren
or
shall
they
be
sold
unto
us
then
held
they
their
peace
and
found
nothing
to
answer
5
9
also
i
said
it
is
not
good
that
ye
do
ought
ye
not
to
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
god
because
of
the
reproach
of
the
heathen
our
enemies
5
10
i
likewise
and
my
brethren
and
my
servants
might
exact
of
them
money
and
corn
i
pray
you
let
us
leave
off
this
usury
5
11
restore
i
pray
you
to
them
even
this
day
their
lands
their
vineyards
their
oliveyards
and
their
houses
also
the
hundredth
part
of
the
money
and
of
the
corn
the
wine
and
the
oil
that
ye
exact
of
them
5
12
then
said
they
we
will
restore
them
and
will
require
nothing
of
them
so
will
we
do
as
thou
sayest
then
i
called
the
priests
and
took
an
oath
of
them
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
promise
5
13
also
i
shook
my
lap
and
said
so
god
shake
out
every
man
from
his
house
and
from
his
labour
that
performeth
not
this
promise
even
thus
be
he
shaken
out
and
emptied
and
all
the
congregation
said
amen
and
praised
the
lord
and
the
people
did
according
to
this
promise
5
14
moreover
from
the
time
that
i
was
appointed
to
be
their
governor
in
the
land
of
judah
from
the
twentieth
year
even
unto
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
the
king
that
is
twelve
years
i
and
my
brethren
have
not
eaten
the
bread
of
the
governor
5
15
but
the
former
governors
that
had
been
before
me
were
chargeable
unto
the
people
and
had
taken
of
them
bread
and
wine
beside
forty
shekels
of
silver
yea
even
their
servants
bare
rule
over
the
people
but
so
did
not
i
because
of
the
fear
of
god
5
16
yea
also
i
continued
in
the
work
of
this
wall
neither
bought
we
any
land
and
all
my
servants
were
gathered
thither
unto
the
work
5
17
moreover
there
were
at
my
table
an
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
jews
and
rulers
beside
those
that
came
unto
us
from
among
the
heathen
that
are
about
us
5
18
now
that
which
was
prepared
for
me
daily
was
one
ox
and
six
choice
sheep
also
fowls
were
prepared
for
me
and
once
in
ten
days
store
of
all
sorts
of
wine
yet
for
all
this
required
not
i
the
bread
of
the
governor
because
the
bondage
was
heavy
upon
this
people
5
19
think
upon
me
my
god
for
good
according
to
all
that
i
have
done
for
this

now
it
came
to
pass
when
sanballat
and
tobiah
and
geshem
the
arabian
and
the
rest
of
our
enemies
heard
that
i
had
builded
the
wall
and
that
there
was
no
breach
left
therein
(though
at
that
time
i
had
not
set
up
the
doors
upon
the
gates
)
6
2
that
sanballat
and
geshem
sent
unto
me
saying
come
let
us
meet
together
in
some
one
of
the
villages
in
the
plain
of
ono
but
they
thought
to
do
me
mischief
6
3
and
i
sent
messengers
unto
them
saying
i
am
doing
a
great
work
so
that
i
cannot
come
down
why
should
the
work
cease
whilst
i
leave
it
and
come
down
to
you
6
4
yet
they
sent
unto
me
four
times
after
this
sort
and
i
answered
them
after
the
same
manner
6
5
then
sent
sanballat
his
servant
unto
me
in
like
manner
the
fifth
time
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
6
6
wherein
was
written
it
is
reported
among
the
heathen
and
gashmu
saith
it
that
thou
and
the
jews
think
to
rebel
for
which
cause
thou
buildest
the
wall
that
thou
mayest
be
their
king
according
to
these
words
6
7
and
thou
hast
also
appointed
prophets
to
preach
of
thee
at
jerusalem
saying
there
is
a
king
in
judah
and
now
shall
it
be
reported
to
the
king
according
to
these
words
come
now
therefore
and
let
us
take
counsel
together
6
8
then
i
sent
unto
him
saying
there
are
no
such
things
done
as
thou
sayest
but
thou
feignest
them
out
of
thine
own
heart
6
9
for
they
all
made
us
afraid
saying
their
hands
shall
be
weakened
from
the
work
that
it
be
not
done
now
therefore
o
god
strengthen
my
hands
6
10
afterward
i
came
unto
the
house
of
shemaiah
the
son
of
delaiah
the
son
of
mehetabeel
who
was
shut
up
and
he
said
let
us
meet
together
in
the
house
of
god
within
the
temple
and
let
us
shut
the
doors
of
the
temple
for
they
will
come
to
slay
thee
yea
in
the
night
will
they
come
to
slay
thee
6
11
and
i
said
should
such
a
man
as
i
flee
and
who
is
there
that
being
as
i
am
would
go
into
the
temple
to
save
his
life
i
will
not
go
in
6
12
and
lo
i
perceived
that
god
had
not
sent
him
but
that
he
pronounced
this
prophecy
against
me
for
tobiah
and
sanballat
had
hired
him
6
13
therefore
was
he
hired
that
i
should
be
afraid
and
do
so
and
sin
and
that
they
might
have
matter
for
an
evil
report
that
they
might
reproach
me
6
14
my
god
think
thou
upon
tobiah
and
sanballat
according
to
these
their
works
and
on
the
prophetess
noadiah
and
the
rest
of
the
prophets
that
would
have
put
me
in
fear
6
15
so
the
wall
was
finished
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
day
of
the
month
elul
in
fifty
and
two
days
6
16
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
all
our
enemies
heard
thereof
and
all
the
heathen
that
were
about
us
saw
these
things
they
were
much
cast
down
in
their
own
eyes
for
they
perceived
that
this
work
was
wrought
of
our
god
6
17
moreover
in
those
days
the
nobles
of
judah
sent
many
letters
unto
tobiah
and
the
letters
of
tobiah
came
unto
them
6
18
for
there
were
many
in
judah
sworn
unto
him
because
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
shechaniah
the
son
of
arah
and
his
son
johanan
had
taken
the
daughter
of
meshullam
the
son
of
berechiah
6
19
also
they
reported
his
good
deeds
before
me
and
uttered
my
words
to
him
and
tobiah
sent
letters
to
put
me
in
fear
7
1
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
wall
was
built
and
i
had
set
up
the
doors
and
the
porters
and
the
singers
and
the
levites
were
appointed
7
2
that
i
gave
my
brother
hanani
and
hananiah
the
ruler
of
the
palace
charge
over
jerusalem
for
he
was
a
faithful
man
and
feared
god
above
many
7
3
and
i
said
unto
them
let
not
the
gates
of
jerusalem
be
opened
until
the
sun
be
hot
and
while
they
stand
by
let
them
shut
the
doors
and
bar
them
and
appoint
watches
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
every
one
in
his
watch
and
every
one
to
be
over
against
his
house
7
4
now
the
city
was
large
and
great
but
the
people
were
few
therein
and
the
houses
were
not
builded
7
5
and
my
god
put
into
mine
heart
to
gather
together
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
that
they
might
be
reckoned
by
genealogy
and
i
found
a
register
of
the
genealogy
of
them
which
came
up
at
the
first
and
found
written
therein
7
6
these
are
the
children
of
the
province
that
went
up
out
of
the
captivity
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
whom
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
and
came
again
to
jerusalem

to
judah

the
porters
and
the
singers
and
some
of
the
people
and
the
nethinims
and
all
israel
dwelt
in

cities
and
when
the
seventh
month
came
the
children
of
israel
were
in
their
cities
8
1
and
all
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
as
one
man
into
the
street
that
was
before
the
water
gate
and
they
spake
unto
ezra
the
scribe
to
bring
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
which
the
lord
had
commanded
to
israel
8
2
and
ezra
the
priest
brought
the
law
before
the
congregation
both
of
men
and
women
and
all
that
could
hear
with
understanding
upon
the
first
day
of
the
seventh
month
8
3
and
he
read
therein
before
the
street
that
was
before
the
water
gate
from
the
morning
until
midday
before
the
men
and
the
women
and
those
that
could
understand
and
the
ears
of
all
the
people
were
attentive
unto
the
book
of
the
law
8
4
and
ezra
the
scribe
stood
upon
a
pulpit
of
wood
which
they
had
made
for
the
purpose
and
beside
him
stood
mattithiah
and
shema
and
anaiah
and
urijah
and
hilkiah
and
maaseiah
on
his
right
hand
and
on

pedaiah
and
mishael
and
malchiah
and

and

zechariah

8
5
and
ezra
opened
the
book
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
(for
he
was
above
all
the
people
)
and
when
he
opened
it
all
the
people
stood
up
8
6
and
ezra
blessed
the
lord
the
great
god
and
all
the
people
answered
amen
amen
with
lifting
up
their
hands
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
the
lord
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
8

also
jeshua
and
bani
and
sherebiah
jamin
akkub
shabbethai
hodijah
maaseiah
kelita
azariah
jozabad
hanan
pelaiah
and
the
levites
caused
the
people
to
understand
the
law
and
the
people
stood
in
their
place
8
8
so
they
read
in
the
book
in
the
law
of
god
distinctly
and
gave
the
sense
and
caused
them
to
understand
the
reading
8
9
and
nehemiah
which
is
the
tirshatha
and
ezra
the
priest
the
scribe
and
the
levites
that
taught
the
people
said
unto
all
the
people
this
day
is
holy
unto
the
lord
your
god
mourn
not
nor
weep
for
all
the
people
wept
when
they
heard
the
words
of
the
law
8
10
then
he
said
unto
them
go
your
way
eat
the
fat
and
drink
the
sweet
and
send
portions
unto
them
for
whom
nothing
is
prepared
for
this
day
is
holy
unto
our
lord
neither
be
ye
sorry
for
the
joy
of
the
lord
is
your
strength
8
11
so
the
levites
stilled
all
the
people
saying
hold
your
peace
for
the
day
is
holy
neither
be
ye
grieved
8
12
and
all
the
people
went
their
way
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
send
portions
and
to
make
great
mirth
because
they
had
understood
the
words
that
were
declared
unto
them
8
13
and
on
the
second
day
were
gathered
together
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
all
the
people
the
priests
and
the
levites
unto
ezra
the
scribe
even
to
understand
the
words
of
the
law
8
14
and
they
found
written
in
the
law
which
the
lord
had
commanded
by
moses
that
the
children
of
israel
should
dwell
in
booths
in
the
feast
of
the
seventh
month
8
15
and
that
they
should
publish
and
proclaim
in
all
their
cities
and
in
jerusalem
saying
go
forth
unto
the
mount
and
fetch
olive

and
myrtle
branches
and
palm
branches
and
branches
of
thick
trees
to
make
booths
as
it
is
written
8

so
the
people
went
forth
and
brought
them
and
made
themselves
booths
every
one
upon
the
roof
of
his
house
and
in
their

and
in

and
in
the

and
in

of
ephraim
8
17
and
all
the
congregation
of
them
that
were
come
again
out
of
the
captivity
made
booths
and
sat
under
the
booths
for
since
the
days
of
jeshua
the
son
of
nun
unto
that
day
had
not
the
children
of
israel
done
so
and
there
was
very
great
gladness
8
18
also
day
by
day
from
the
first
day
unto
the
last
day
he
read
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
god
and
they
kept
the
feast
seven
days
and
on
the
eighth
day
was
a
solemn
assembly
according
unto
the
manner
9
1
now
in
the
twenty
and
fourth
day
of
this
month
the
children
of
israel
were
assembled
with
fasting
and
with
sackclothes
and
earth
upon
them
9
2
and
the
seed
of
israel
separated
themselves
from
all
strangers
and
stood
and
confessed
their
sins
and
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
9
3
and
they
stood
up
in
their
place
and
read
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
their
god
one
fourth
part
of
the
day
and
another
fourth
part
they
confessed
and
worshipped
the
lord
their
god
9

then
stood
up
upon
the
stairs
of
the
levites
jeshua
and
bani
kadmiel
shebaniah
bunni
sherebiah
bani
and
chenani
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
unto
the
lord
their
god
9
5
then
the
levites
jeshua
and
kadmiel
bani
hashabniah
sherebiah
hodijah
shebaniah
and
pethahiah
said
stand
up
and
bless
the
lord
your
god
for
ever
and
ever
and
blessed
be
thy
glorious
name
which
is
exalted
above
all
blessing
and
praise
9
6
thou
even
thou
art
lord
alone
thou
hast
made
heaven
the
heaven
of
heavens
with
all
their
host
the
earth
and
all
things
that
are
therein
the
seas
and
all
that
is
therein
and
thou
preservest
them
all
and
the
host
of
heaven
worshippeth
thee
9
7
thou
art
the
lord
the
god
who
didst
choose
abram
and
broughtest
him
forth
out
of
ur
of
the
chaldees
and
gavest
him
the
name
of
abraham
9
8
and
foundest
his
heart
faithful
before
thee
and
madest
a
covenant
with
him
to
give
the
land
of
the
canaanites
the
hittites
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
jebusites
and
the
girgashites
to
give
it
i
say
to
his
seed
and
hast
performed
thy
words
for
thou
art
righteous
9
9
and
didst
see
the
affliction
of
our
fathers
in
egypt
and
heardest
their
cry
by
the
red
sea
9
10
and
shewedst
signs
and
wonders
upon
pharaoh
and
on
all
his
servants
and
on
all
the
people
of
his
land
for
thou
knewest
that
they
dealt
proudly
against
them
so
didst
thou
get
thee
a
name
as
it
is
this
day
9
11
and
thou
didst
divide
the
sea
before
them
so
that
they
went
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
on
the
dry
land
and
their
persecutors
thou
threwest
into
the
deeps
as
a
stone
into
the
mighty
waters
9
12
moreover
thou
leddest
them
in
the
day
by
a
cloudy
pillar
and
in
the
night
by
a
pillar
of
fire
to
give
them
light
in
the
way
wherein
they
should
go
9
13
thou
camest
down
also
upon
mount
sinai
and
spakest
with
them
from
heaven
and
gavest
them
right
judgments
and
true
laws
good
statutes
and
commandments
9
14
and
madest
known
unto
them
thy
holy
sabbath
and
commandedst
them
precepts
statutes
and
laws
by
the
hand
of
moses
thy
servant
9
15
and
gavest
them
bread
from
heaven
for
their
hunger
and
broughtest
forth
water
for
them
out
of
the
rock
for
their
thirst
and
promisedst
them
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
thou
hadst
sworn
to
give
them
9
16
but
they
and
our
fathers
dealt
proudly
and
hardened
their
necks
and
hearkened
not
to
thy
commandments
9
17
and
refused
to
obey
neither
were
mindful
of
thy
wonders
that
thou
didst
among
them
but
hardened
their
necks
and
in
their
rebellion
appointed
a
captain
to
return
to
their
bondage
but
thou
art
a
god
ready
to
pardon
gracious
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
forsookest
them
not
9
18
yea
when
they
had
made
them
a
molten
calf
and
said
this
is
thy
god
that
brought
thee
up
out
of
egypt
and
had
wrought
great
provocations
9
19
yet
thou
in
thy
manifold
mercies
forsookest
them
not
in
the
wilderness
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
departed
not
from
them
by
day
to
lead
them
in
the
way
neither
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
to
shew
them
light
and
the
way
wherein
they
should
go
9
20
thou
gavest
also
thy
good
spirit
to
instruct
them
and
withheldest
not
thy
manna
from
their
mouth
and
gavest
them
water
for
their
thirst
9
21
yea
forty
years
didst
thou
sustain
them
in
the
wilderness
so
that
they
lacked
nothing
their
clothes
waxed
not
old
and
their
feet
swelled
not
9
22
moreover
thou
gavest
them
kingdoms
and
nations
and
didst
divide
them
into
corners
so
they
possessed
the
land
of
sihon
and
the
land
of
the
king
of
heshbon
and
the
land
of
og
king
of
bashan
9
23
their
children
also
multipliedst
thou
as
the
stars
of
heaven
and
broughtest
them
into
the
land
concerning
which
thou
hadst
promised
to
their
fathers
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
it
9
24
so
the
children
went
in
and
possessed
the
land
and
thou
subduedst
before
them
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
the
canaanites
and
gavest
them
into
their
hands
with
their
kings
and
the
people
of
the
land
that
they
might
do
with
them
as
they
would
9
25
and
they
took
strong
cities
and
a
fat
land
and
possessed
houses
full
of
all
goods
wells
digged
vineyards
and
oliveyards
and
fruit
trees
in
abundance
so
they
did
eat
and
were
filled
and
became
fat
and
delighted
themselves
in
thy
great
goodness
9
26
nevertheless
they
were
disobedient
and
rebelled
against
thee
and
cast
thy
law
behind
their
backs
and
slew
thy
prophets
which
testified
against
them
to
turn
them
to
thee
and
they
wrought
great
provocations
9
27
therefore
thou
deliveredst
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
who
vexed
them
and
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
when
they
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
them
from
heaven
and
according
to
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
gavest
them
saviours
who
saved
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
9
28
but
after
they
had
rest
they
did
evil
again
before
thee
therefore
leftest
thou
them
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
so
that
they
had
the
dominion
over
them
yet
when
they
returned
and
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
them
from
heaven
and
many
times
didst
thou
deliver
them
according
to
thy
mercies
9
29
and
testifiedst
against
them
that
thou
mightest
bring
them
again
unto
thy
law
yet
they
dealt
proudly
and
hearkened
not
unto
thy
commandments
but
sinned
against
thy
judgments
(which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
)
and
withdrew
the
shoulder
and
hardened
their
neck
and
would
not
hear
9
30
yet
many
years
didst
thou
forbear
them
and
testifiedst
against
them
by
thy
spirit
in
thy
prophets
yet
would
they
not
give
ear
therefore
gavest
thou
them
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
lands
9
31
nevertheless
for
thy
great
mercies’
sake
thou
didst
not
utterly
consume
them
nor
forsake
them
for
thou
art
a
gracious
and
merciful
god
9
32
now
therefore
our
god
the
great
the
mighty
and
the
terrible
god
who
keepest
covenant
and
mercy
let
not
all
the
trouble
seem
little
before
thee
that
hath
come
upon
us
on
our
kings
on
our
princes
and
on
our
priests
and
on
our
prophets
and
on
our
fathers
and
on
all
thy
people
since
the
time
of
the
kings
of
assyria
unto
this
day
9
33
howbeit
thou
art
just
in
all
that
is
brought
upon
us
for
thou
hast
done
right
but
we
have
done
wickedly
9
34
neither
have
our
kings
our
princes
our
priests
nor
our
fathers
kept
thy
law
nor
hearkened
unto
thy
commandments
and
thy
testimonies
wherewith
thou
didst
testify
against
them
9
35
for
they
have
not
served
thee
in
their
kingdom
and
in
thy
great
goodness
that
thou
gavest
them
and
in
the
large
and
fat
land
which
thou
gavest
before
them
neither
turned
they
from
their
wicked
works
9
36
behold
we
are
servants
this
day
and
for
the
land
that
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
to
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
good
thereof
behold
we
are
servants
in
it
9
37
and
it
yieldeth
much
increase
unto
the
kings
whom
thou
hast
set
over
us
because
of
our
sins
also
they
have
dominion
over
our
bodies
and
over
our
cattle
at
their
pleasure
and
we
are
in
great
distress
9
38
and
because
of
all
this
we
make
a
sure
covenant
and
write
it
and
our
princes
levites
and

seal

it

not

and
if

bring

we

not

and
that
we
would
leave
the

the

10
32
also
we
made

for
us
to

yearly
with
the
third

for

and
the

also
and
the
children
rejoiced
so
that
the
joy
of

was
heard

afar
off

44
and
at
that
time
were
some
appointed
over
the
chambers
for
the
treasures
for
the
offerings
for
the
firstfruits
and
for
the
tithes
to
gather
into
them
out
of
the
fields
of
the
cities
the
portions
of
the
law
for
the
priests
and
levites
for
judah
rejoiced
for
the
priests
and
for
the
levites
that
waited
12
45
and
both
the
singers
and
the
porters
kept
the
ward
of
their
god
and
the
ward
of
the
purification
according
to
the
commandment
of
david
and
of
solomon
his
son
12
46
for
in
the
days
of
david
and
asaph
of
old
there
were
chief
of
the
singers
and
songs
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
unto
god
12
47
and
all
israel
in
the
days
of
zerubbabel
and
in
the
days
of
nehemiah
gave
the
portions
of
the
singers
and
the
porters
every
day
his
portion
and
they
sanctified
holy
things
unto
the
levites
and
the
levites
sanctified
them
unto
the
children
of
aaron
13
1
on
that
day
they
read
in
the
book
of
moses
in
the
audience
of
the
people
and
therein
was
found
written
that
the
ammonite
and
the
moabite
should
not
come
into
the
congregation
of
god
for
ever
13
2
because
they
met
not
the
children
of
israel
with
bread
and
with
water
but
hired
balaam
against
them
that
he
should
curse
them
howbeit
our
god
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing
13
3
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
heard
the
law
that
they
separated
from
israel
all
the
mixed
multitude
13
4
and
before
this
eliashib
the
priest
having
the
oversight
of
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
our
god
was
allied
unto
tobiah
13
5
and
he
had
prepared
for
him
a
great
chamber
where
aforetime
they
laid
the
meat
offerings
the
frankincense
and
the
vessels
and
the
tithes
of
the
corn
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
which
was
commanded
to
be
given
to
the
levites
and
the
singers
and
the
porters
and
the
offerings
of
the
priests
13
6
but
in
all
this
time
was
not
i
at
jerusalem
for
in
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
king
of
babylon
came
i
unto
the
king
and
after
certain
days
obtained
i
leave
of
the
king
13
7
and
i
came
to
jerusalem
and
understood
of
the
evil
that
eliashib
did
for
tobiah
in
preparing
him
a
chamber
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
god
13
8
and
it
grieved
me
sore
therefore
i
cast
forth
all
the
household
stuff
to
tobiah
out
of
the
chamber
13
9
then
i
commanded
and
they
cleansed
the
chambers
and
thither
brought
i
again
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
with
the
meat
offering
and
the
frankincense
13
10
and
i
perceived
that
the
portions
of
the
levites
had
not
been
given
them
for
the
levites
and
the
singers
that
did
the
work
were
fled
every
one
to
his
field
13
11
then
contended
i
with
the
rulers
and
said
why
is
the
house
of
god
forsaken
and
i
gathered
them
together
and
set
them
in
their
place
13
12
then
brought
all
judah
the
tithe
of
the
corn
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
unto
the
treasuries
13
13
and
i
made
treasurers
over
the
treasuries
shelemiah
the
priest
and
zadok
the
scribe
and
of
the
levites
pedaiah
and
next
to
them
was
hanan
the
son
of
zaccur
the
son
of
mattaniah
for
they
were
counted
faithful
and
their
office
was
to
distribute
unto
their
brethren
13
14
remember
me
o
my
god
concerning
this
and
wipe
not
out
my
good
deeds
that
i
have
done
for
the
house
of
my
god
and
for
the
offices
thereof
13
15
in
those
days
saw
i
in
judah
some
treading
wine
presses
on
the
sabbath
and
bringing
in
sheaves
and
lading
asses
as
also
wine
grapes
and
figs
and
all
manner
of
burdens
which
they
brought
into
jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day
and
i
testified
against
them
in
the
day
wherein
they
sold
victuals
13
16
there
dwelt
men
of
tyre
also
therein
which
brought
fish
and
all
manner
of
ware
and
sold
on
the
sabbath
unto
the
children
of
judah
and
in
jerusalem
13
17
then
i
contended
with
the
nobles
of
judah
and
said
unto
them
what
evil
thing
is
this
that
ye
do
and
profane
the
sabbath
day
13
18
did
not
your
fathers
thus
and
did
not
our
god
bring
all
this
evil
upon
us
and
upon
this
city
yet
ye
bring
more
wrath
upon
israel
by
profaning
the
sabbath
13
19
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
gates
of
jerusalem
began
to
be
dark
before
the
sabbath
i
commanded
that
the
gates
should
be
shut
and
charged
that
they
should
not
be
opened
till
after
the
sabbath
and
some
of
my
servants
set
i
at
the
gates
that
there
should
no
burden
be
brought
in
on
the
sabbath
day
13
20
so
the
merchants
and
sellers
of
all
kind
of
ware
lodged
without
jerusalem
once
or
twice
13
21
then
i
testified
against
them
and
said
unto
them
why
lodge
ye
about
the
wall
if
ye
do
so
again
i
will
lay
hands
on
you
from
that
time
forth
came
they
no
more
on
the
sabbath
13
22
and
i
commanded
the
levites
that
they
should
cleanse
themselves
and
that
they
should
come
and
keep
the
gates
to
sanctify
the
sabbath
day
remember
me
o
my
god
concerning
this
also
and
spare
me
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy

in
those
days
also
saw
i
jews
that
had
married
wives
of
ashdod
of
ammon
and
of
moab
13
24
and
their
children
spake
half
in
the
speech
of
ashdod
and
could
not
speak
in
the
jews’
language
but
according
to
the
language
of
each
people
13
25
and
i
contended
with
them
and
cursed
them
and
smote
certain
of
them
and
plucked
off
their
hair
and
made
them
swear
by
god
saying
ye
shall
not
give
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
nor
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons
or
for
yourselves
13
26
did
not
solomon
king
of
israel
sin
by
these
things
yet
among
many
nations
was
there
no
king
like
him
who
was
beloved
of
his
god
and
god
made
him
king
over
all
israel
nevertheless
even
him
did
outlandish
women
cause
to
sin
13
27
shall
we
then
hearken
unto
you
to
do
all
this
great
evil
to
transgress
against
our
god
in
marrying
strange
wives
13
28
and
one
of
the
sons
of
joiada
the
son
of
eliashib
the
high
priest
was
son
in
law
to
sanballat
the
horonite
therefore
i
chased
him
from
me
13
29
remember
them
o
my
god
because
they
have
defiled
the
priesthood
and
the
covenant
of
the
priesthood
and
of
the
levites
13
30
thus
cleansed
i
them
from
all
strangers
and
appointed

in

times
appointed
and
for

now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
ahasuerus
(this
is
ahasuerus
which
reigned
from
india
even
unto
ethiopia
over
an
hundred
and
seven
and
twenty
provinces
)
1

that
in
those
days
when
the
king
ahasuerus
sat
on
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
which
was
in
shushan
the
palace
1

in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
servants
the
power
of
persia
and
media
the
nobles
and
princes
of
the
provinces
being
before
him
1

when
he
shewed
the
riches
of
his
glorious
kingdom
and
the
honour
of
his
excellent
majesty
many
days
even
an
hundred
and
fourscore
days
1
5
and
when
these
days
were
expired
the
king
made
a
feast
unto
all
the
people
that
were
present
in
shushan
the
palace
both
unto
great
and
small
seven
days
in
the
court
of
the
garden
of
the
king’s
palace
1

where
were
white
green
and
blue
hangings
fastened
with
cords
of
fine
linen
and
purple
to
silver
rings
and
pillars
of
marble
the
beds
were
of
gold
and
silver
upon
a
pavement
of
red
and
blue
and
white
and
black
marble
1

and
they
gave
them
drink
in
vessels
of
gold
(the
vessels
being
diverse
one
from
another
)
and
royal
wine
in
abundance
according
to
the
state
of
the
king
1
8
and
the
drinking
was
according
to
the
law
none
did
compel
for
so
the
king
had
appointed
to
all
the
officers
of
his
house
that
they
should
do
according
to
every
man’s
pleasure
1
9
also
vashti
the
queen
made
a
feast
for
the
women
in
the
royal
house
which
belonged
to
king
ahasuerus
1
10
on
the
seventh
day
when
the
heart
of
the
king
was
merry
with
wine
he
commanded
mehuman
biztha
harbona
bigtha
and
abagtha
zethar
and
carcas
the
seven
chamberlains
that
served
in
the
presence
of
ahasuerus
the
king
1
11
to
bring
vashti
the
queen
before
the
king
with
the
crown
royal
to
shew
the
people
and
the
princes
her
beauty
for
she
was
fair
to
look
on
1
12
but
the
queen
vashti
refused
to
come
at
the
king’s
commandment
by
his
chamberlains
therefore
was
the
king
very
wroth
and
his
anger
burned
in
him
1
13
then
the
king
said
to
the
wise
men
which
knew
the
times
(for
so
was
the
king’s
manner
toward
all
that
knew
law
and
judgment
1
14
and
the
next
unto
him
was
carshena
shethar
admatha
tarshish
meres
marsena
and
memucan
the
seven
princes
of
persia
and
media
which
saw
the
king’s
face
and
which
sat
the
first
in
the
kingdom
)
1
15
what
shall
we
do
unto
the
queen
vashti
according
to
law
because
she
hath
not
performed
the
commandment
of
the
king
ahasuerus
by
the
chamberlains
1
16
and
memucan
answered
before
the
king
and
the
princes
vashti
the
queen
hath
not
done
wrong
to
the
king
only
but
also
to
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
that
are
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
1
17
for
this
deed
of
the
queen
shall
come
abroad
unto
all
women
so
that
they
shall
despise
their
husbands
in
their
eyes
when
it
shall
be
reported
the
king
ahasuerus
commanded
vashti
the
queen
to
be
brought
in
before
him
but
she
came
not
1
18
likewise
shall
the
ladies
of
persia
and
media
say
this
day
unto
all
the
king’s
princes
which
have
heard
of
the
deed
of
the
queen
thus
shall
there
arise
too
much
contempt
and
wrath
1
19
if
it
please
the
king
let
there
go
a
royal
commandment
from
him
and
let
it
be
written
among
the
laws
of
the
persians
and
the
medes
that
it
be
not
altered
that
vashti
come
no
more
before
king
ahasuerus
and
let
the
king
give
her
royal
estate
unto
another
that
is
better
than
she
1
20
and
when
the
king’s
decree
which
he
shall
make
shall
be
published
throughout
all
his
empire
(for
it
is
great
)
all
the
wives
shall
give
to
their
husbands
honour
both
to
great
and
small
1
21
and
the
saying
pleased
the
king
and
the
princes
and
the
king
did
according
to
the
word
of
memucan
1
22
for
he
sent
letters
into
all
the
king’s
provinces
into
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof
and
to
every
people
after
their
language
that
every
man
should
bear
rule
in
his
own
house
and
that
it
should
be
published
according
to
the
language
of
every
people
2
1
after
these
things
when
the
wrath
of
king
ahasuerus
was
appeased
he
remembered
vashti
and
what
she
had
done
and
what
was
decreed
against
her
2
2
then
said
the
king’s
servants
that
ministered
unto
him
let
there
be
fair
young
virgins
sought
for
the
king
2
3
and
let
the
king
appoint
officers
in
all
the
provinces
of
his
kingdom
that
they
may
gather
together
all
the
fair
young
virgins
unto
shushan
the
palace
to
the
house
of
the
women
unto
the
custody
of
hege
the
king’s
chamberlain
keeper
of
the
women
and
let
their
things
for
purification
be
given
them
2
4
and
let
the
maiden
which
pleaseth
the
king
be
queen
instead
of
vashti
and
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
he
did
so
2
5
now
in
shushan
the
palace
there
was
a
certain
jew
whose
name
was
mordecai
the
son
of
jair
the
son
of
shimei
the
son
of
kish
a
benjamite
2
6
who
had
been
carried
away
from
jerusalem
with
the
captivity
which
had
been
carried
away
with
jeconiah
king
of
judah
whom
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
2
7
and
he
brought
up
hadassah
that
is
esther
his
uncle’s
daughter
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
the
maid
was
fair
and
beautiful
whom
mordecai
when
her
father
and
mother
were
dead
took
for
his
own
daughter
2
8
so
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king’s
commandment
and
his
decree
was
heard
and
when
many
maidens
were
gathered
together
unto
shushan
the
palace
to
the
custody
of
hegai
that
esther
was
brought
also
unto
the
king’s
house
to
the
custody
of
hegai
keeper
of
the
women
2
9
and
the
maiden
pleased
him
and
she
obtained
kindness
of
him
and
he
speedily
gave
her
her
things
for
purification
with
such
things
as
belonged
to
her
and
seven
maidens
which
were
meet
to
be
given
her
out
of
the
king’s
house
and
he
preferred
her
and
her
maids
unto
the
best
place
of
the
house
of
the
women
2
10
esther
had
not
shewed
her
people
nor
her
kindred
for
mordecai
had
charged
her
that
she
should
not
shew
it
2
11
and
mordecai
walked
every
day
before
the
court
of
the
women’s
house
to
know
how
esther
did
and
what
should
become
of
her
2
12
now
when
every
maid’s
turn
was
come
to
go
in
to
king
ahasuerus
after
that
she
had
been
twelve
months
according
to
the
manner
of
the
women
(for
so
were
the
days
of
their
purifications
accomplished
to
wit
six
months
with
oil
of
myrrh
and
six
months
with
sweet
odours
and
with
other
things
for
the
purifying
of
the
women
)
2
13
then
thus
came
every
maiden
unto
the
king
whatsoever
she
desired
was
given
her
to
go
with
her
out
of
the
house
of
the
women
unto
the
king’s
house
2
14
in
the
evening
she
went
and
on
the
morrow
she
returned
into
the
second
house
of
the
women
to
the
custody
of
shaashgaz
the
king’s
chamberlain
which
kept
the
concubines
she
came
in
unto
the
king
no
more
except
the
king
delighted
in
her
and
that
she
were
called
by
name
2
15
now
when
the
turn
of
esther
the
daughter
of
abihail
the
uncle
of
mordecai
who
had
taken
her
for
his
daughter
was
come
to
go
in
unto
the
king
she
required
nothing
but
what
hegai
the
king’s
chamberlain
the
keeper
of
the
women
appointed
and
esther
obtained
favour
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
looked
upon
her
2
16
so
esther
was
taken
unto
king
ahasuerus
into
his
house
royal
in
the
tenth
month
which
is
the
month
tebeth
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
reign
2
17
and
the
king
loved
esther
above
all
the
women
and
she
obtained
grace
and
favour
in
his
sight
more
than
all
the
virgins
so
that
he
set
the
royal
crown
upon
her
head
and
made
her
queen
instead
of
vashti
2
18
then
the
king
made
a
great
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
servants
even
esther’s
feast
and
he
made
a
release
to
the
provinces
and
gave
gifts
according
to
the
state
of
the
king
2
19
and
when
the
virgins
were
gathered
together
the
second
time
then
mordecai
sat
in
the
king’s
gate
2
20
esther
had
not
yet
shewed
her
kindred
nor
her
people
as
mordecai
had
charged
her
for
esther
did
the
commandment
of
mordecai
like
as
when
she
was
brought
up
with
him
2
21
in
those
days
while
mordecai
sat
in
the
king’s
gate
two
of
the
king’s
chamberlains
bigthan
and
teresh
of
those
which
kept
the
door
were
wroth
and
sought
to
lay
hands
on
the
king
ahasuerus
2
22
and
the
thing
was
known
to
mordecai
who
told
it
unto
esther
the
queen
and
esther
certified
the
king
thereof
in
mordecai’s
name
2
23
and
when
inquisition
was
made
of
the
matter
it
was
found
out
therefore
they
were
both
hanged
on
a
tree
and
it
was
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
before
the
king
3
1
after
these
things
did
king
ahasuerus
promote
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
and
advanced
him
and
set
his
seat
above
all
the
princes
that
were
with
him
3
2
and
all
the
king’s
servants
that
were
in
the
king’s
gate
bowed
and
reverenced
haman
for
the
king
had
so
commanded
concerning
him
but
mordecai
bowed
not
nor
did
him
reverence
3
3
then
the
king’s
servants
which
were
in
the
king’s
gate
said
unto
mordecai
why
transgressest
thou
the
king’s
commandment
3
4
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
spake
daily
unto
him
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them
that
they
told
haman
to
see
whether
mordecai’s
matters
would
stand
for
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
jew
3
5
and
when
haman
saw
that
mordecai
bowed
not
nor
did
him
reverence
then
was
haman
full
of
wrath
3
6
and
he
thought
scorn
to
lay
hands
on
mordecai
alone
for
they
had
shewed
him
the
people
of
mordecai
wherefore
haman
sought
to
destroy
all
the
jews
that
were
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
ahasuerus
even
the
people
of
mordecai
3
7
in
the
first
month
that
is
the
month
nisan
in
the
twelfth
year
of
king
ahasuerus
they
cast
pur
that
is
the
lot
before
haman
from
day
to
day
and
from
month
to
month
to
the
twelfth
month
that
is
the
month
adar
3
8
and
haman
said
unto
king
ahasuerus
there
is
a
certain
people
scattered
abroad
and
dispersed
among
the
people
in
all
the
provinces
of
thy
kingdom
and
their
laws
are
diverse
from
all
people
neither
keep
they
the
king’s
laws
therefore
it
is
not
for
the
king’s
profit
to
suffer
them
3
9
if
it
please
the
king
let
it
be
written
that
they
may
be
destroyed
and
i
will
pay
ten
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
the
hands
of
those
that
have
the
charge
of
the
business
to
bring
it
into
the
king’s
treasuries
3
10
and
the
king
took
his
ring
from
his
hand
and
gave
it
unto
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
the
jews’
enemy
3
11
and
the
king
said
unto
haman
the
silver
is
given
to
thee
the
people
also
to
do
with
them
as
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
3
12
then
were
the
king’s
scribes
called
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
there
was
written
according
to
all
that
haman
had
commanded
unto
the
king’s
lieutenants
and
to
the
governors
that
were
over
every
province
and
to
the
rulers
of
every
people
of
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof
and
to
every
people
after
their
language
in
the
name
of
king
ahasuerus
was
it
written
and
sealed
with
the
king’s
ring
3
13
and
the
letters
were
sent
by
posts
into
all
the
king’s
provinces
to
destroy
to
kill
and
to
cause
to
perish
all
jews
both
young
and
old
little
children
and
women
in
one
day
even
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
month
which
is
the
month
adar
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
prey
3
14
the
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
people
that
they
should
be
ready
against
that
day
3
15
the
posts
went
out
being
hastened
by
the
king’s
commandment
and
the
decree
was
given
in
shushan
the
palace
and
the
king
and
haman
sat
down
to
drink
but
the
city
shushan
was
perplexed
4
1
when
mordecai
perceived
all
that
was
done
mordecai
rent
his
clothes
and
put
on
sackcloth
with
ashes
and
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
city
and
cried
with
a
loud
and
a
bitter
cry
4
2
and
came
even
before
the
king’s
gate
for
none
might
enter
into
the
king’s
gate
clothed
with
sackcloth
4
3
and
in
every
province
whithersoever
the
king’s
commandment
and
his
decree
came
there
was
great
mourning
among
the
jews
and
fasting
and
weeping
and
wailing
and
many
lay
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
4

so
esther’s
maids
and
her
chamberlains
came
and
told
it
her
then
was
the
queen
exceedingly
grieved
and
she
sent
raiment
to
clothe
mordecai
and
to
take
away
his
sackcloth
from
him
but
he
received
it
not
4
5
then
called
esther
for
hatach
one
of
the
king’s
chamberlains
whom
he
had
appointed
to
attend
upon
her
and
gave
him
a
commandment
to
mordecai
to
know
what
it
was
and
why
it
was
4
6
so
hatach
went
forth
to
mordecai
unto
the
street
of
the
city
which
was
before
the
king’s
gate
4
7
and
mordecai
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
unto
him
and
of
the
sum
of
the
money
that
haman
had
promised
to
pay
to
the
king’s
treasuries
for
the
jews
to
destroy
them
4
8
also
he
gave
him
the
copy
of
the
writing
of
the
decree
that
was
given
at
shushan
to
destroy
them
to
shew
it
unto
esther
and
to
declare
it
unto
her
and
to
charge
her
that
she
should
go
in
unto
the
king
to
make
supplication
unto
him
and
to
make
request
before
him
for
her
people
4
9
and
hatach
came
and
told
esther
the
words
of
mordecai
4
10
again
esther
spake
unto
hatach
and
gave
him
commandment
unto
mordecai
4
11
all
the
king’s
servants
and
the
people
of
the
king’s
provinces
do
know
that
whosoever
whether
man
or
woman
shall
come
unto
the
king
into
the
inner
court
who
is
not
called
there
is
one
law
of
his
to
put
him
to
death
except
such
to
whom
the
king
shall
hold
out
the
golden
sceptre
that
he
may
live
but
i
have
not
been
called
to
come
in
unto
the
king
these
thirty
days
4
12
and
they
told
to
mordecai
esther’s
words
4
13
then
mordecai
commanded
to
answer
esther
think
not
with
thyself
that
thou
shalt
escape
in
the
king’s
house
more
than
all
the
jews
4
14
for
if
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
time
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
thou
and
thy
father’s
house
shall
be
destroyed
and
who
knoweth
whether
thou
art
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
this
4
15
then
esther
bade
them
return
mordecai
this
answer
4
16
go
gather
together
all
the
jews
that
are
present
in
shushan
and
fast
ye
for
me
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
three
days
night
or
day
i
also
and
my
maidens
will
fast
likewise
and
so
will
i
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
not
according
to
the
law
and
if
i
perish
i
perish
4
17
so
mordecai
went
his
way
and
did
according
to
all
that
esther
had
commanded
him
5
1
now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day
that
esther
put
on
her
royal
apparel
and
stood
in
the
inner
court
of
the
king’s
house
over
against
the
king’s
house
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
royal
throne
in
the
royal
house
over
against
the
gate
of
the
house
5
2
and
it
was
so
when
the
king
saw
esther
the
queen
standing
in
the
court
that
she
obtained
favour
in
his
sight
and
the
king
held
out
to
esther
the
golden
sceptre
that
was
in
his
hand
so
esther
drew
near
and
touched
the
top
of
the
sceptre
5
3
then
said
the
king
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
queen
esther
and
what
is
thy
request
it
shall
be
even
given
thee
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
5
4
and
esther
answered
if
it
seem
good
unto
the
king
let
the
king
and
haman
come
this
day
unto
the
banquet
that
i
have
prepared
for
him
5
5
then
the
king
said
cause
haman
to
make
haste
that
he
may
do
as
esther
hath
said
so
the
king
and
haman
came
to
the
banquet
that
esther
had
prepared
5
6
and
the
king
said
unto
esther
at
the
banquet
of
wine
what
is
thy
petition
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee
and
what
is
thy
request
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
it
shall
be
performed
5
7
then
answered
esther
and
said
my
petition
and
my
request
is
5
8
if
i
have
found
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
king
and
if
it
please
the
king
to
grant
my
petition
and
to
perform
my
request
let
the
king
and
haman
come
to
the
banquet
that
i
shall
prepare
for
them
and
i
will
do
to
morrow
as
the
king
hath
said
5
9
then
went
haman
forth
that
day
joyful
and
with
a
glad
heart
but
when
haman
saw
mordecai
in
the
king’s
gate
that
he
stood
not
up
nor
moved
for
him
he
was
full
of
indignation
against
mordecai
5
10
nevertheless
haman
refrained
himself
and
when
he
came
home
he
sent
and
called
for
his
friends
and
zeresh
his
wife
5
11
and
haman
told
them
of
the
glory
of
his
riches
and
the
multitude
of
his
children
and
all
the
things
wherein
the
king
had
promoted
him
and
how
he
had
advanced
him
above
the
princes
and
servants
of
the
king
5
12
haman
said
moreover
yea
esther
the
queen
did
let
no
man
come
in
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
that
she
had
prepared
but
myself
and
to
morrow
am
i
invited
unto
her
also
with
the
king
5
13
yet
all
this
availeth
me
nothing
so
long
as
i
see
mordecai
the
jew
sitting
at
the
king’s
gate
5
14
then
said
zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
unto
him
let
a
gallows
be
made
of
fifty
cubits
high
and
to
morrow
speak
thou
unto
the
king
that
mordecai
may
be
hanged
thereon
then
go
thou
in
merrily
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
and
the
thing
pleased
haman
and
he
caused
the
gallows
to
be
made
6
1
on
that
night
could
not
the
king
sleep
and
he
commanded
to
bring
the
book
of
records
of
the
chronicles
and
they
were
read
before
the
king
6
2
and
it
was
found
written
that
mordecai
had
told
of
bigthana
and
teresh
two
of
the
king’s
chamberlains
the
keepers
of
the
door
who
sought
to
lay
hand
on
the
king
ahasuerus
6
3
and
the
king
said
what
honour
and
dignity
hath
been
done
to
mordecai
for
this
then
said
the
king’s
servants
that
ministered
unto
him
there
is
nothing
done
for
him
6
4
and
the
king
said
who
is
in
the
court
now
haman
was
come
into
the
outward
court
of
the
king’s
house
to
speak
unto
the
king
to
hang
mordecai
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
him
6
5
and
the
king’s
servants
said
unto
him
behold
haman
standeth
in
the
court
and
the
king
said
let
him
come
in
6
6
so
haman
came
in
and
the
king
said
unto
him
what
shall
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
now
haman
thought
in
his
heart
to
whom
would
the
king
delight
to
do
honour
more
than
to
myself
6
7
and
haman
answered
the
king
for
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
6
8
let
the
royal
apparel
be
brought
which
the
king
useth
to
wear
and
the
horse
that
the
king
rideth
upon
and
the
crown
royal
which
is
set
upon
his
head
6
9
and
let
this
apparel
and
horse
be
delivered
to
the
hand
of
one
of
the
king’s
most
noble
princes
that
they
may
array
the
man
withal
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
and
bring
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city
and
proclaim
before
him
thus
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
6
10
then
the
king
said
to
haman
make
haste
and
take
the
apparel
and
the
horse
as
thou
hast
said
and
do
even
so
to
mordecai
the
jew
that
sitteth
at
the
king’s
gate
let
nothing
fail
of
all
that
thou
hast
spoken
6
11
then
took
haman
the
apparel
and
the
horse
and
arrayed
mordecai
and
brought
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city
and
proclaimed
before
him
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
6
12
and
mordecai
came
again
to
the
king’s
gate
but
haman
hasted
to
his
house
mourning
and
having
his
head
covered
6
13
and
haman
told
zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
every
thing
that
had
befallen
him
then
said
his
wise
men
and
zeresh
his
wife
unto
him
if
mordecai
be
of
the
seed
of
the
jews
before
whom
thou
hast
begun
to
fall
thou
shalt
not
prevail
against
him
but
shalt
surely
fall
before
him
6
14
and
while
they
were
yet
talking
with
him
came
the
king’s
chamberlains
and
hasted
to
bring
haman
unto
the
banquet
that
esther
had
prepared
7
1
so
the
king
and
haman
came
to
banquet
with
esther
the
queen
7
2
and
the
king
said
again
unto
esther
on
the
second
day
at
the
banquet
of
wine
what
is
thy
petition
queen
esther
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee
and
what
is
thy
request
and
it
shall
be
performed
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
7
3
then
esther
the
queen
answered
and
said
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
o
king
and
if
it
please
the
king
let
my
life
be
given
me
at
my
petition
and
my
people
at
my
request
7
4
for
we
are
sold
i
and
my
people
to
be
destroyed
to
be
slain
and
to
perish
but
if
we
had
been
sold
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
i
had
held
my
tongue
although
the
enemy
could
not
countervail
the
king’s
damage
7
5
then
the
king
ahasuerus
answered
and
said
unto
esther
the
queen
who
is
he
and
where
is
he
that
durst
presume
in
his
heart
to
do
so
7
6
and
esther
said
the
adversary
and
enemy
is
this
wicked
haman
then
haman
was
afraid
before
the
king
and
the
queen
7
7
and
the
king
arising
from
the
banquet
of
wine
in
his
wrath
went
into
the
palace
garden
and
haman
stood
up
to
make
request
for
his
life
to
esther
the
queen
for
he
saw
that
there
was
evil
determined
against
him
by
the
king
7
8
then
the
king
returned
out
of
the
palace
garden
into
the
place
of
the
banquet
of
wine
and
haman
was
fallen
upon
the
bed
whereon
esther
was
then
said
the
king
will
he
force
the
queen
also
before
me
in
the
house
as
the
word
went
out
of
the
king’s
mouth
they
covered
haman’s
face
7
9
and
harbonah
one
of
the
chamberlains
said
before
the
king
behold
also
the
gallows
fifty
cubits
high
which
haman
had
made
for
mordecai
who
had
spoken
good
for
the
king
standeth
in
the
house
of
haman
then
the
king
said
hang
him
thereon
7
10
so
they
hanged
haman
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
mordecai
then
was
the
king’s
wrath
pacified
8
1
on
that
day
did
the
king
ahasuerus
give
the
house
of
haman
the
jews’
enemy
unto
esther
the
queen
and
mordecai
came
before
the
king
for
esther
had
told
what
he
was
unto
her
8
2
and
the
king
took
off
his
ring
which
he
had
taken
from
haman
and
gave
it
unto
mordecai
and
esther
set
mordecai
over
the
house
of
haman
8
3
and
esther
spake
yet
again
before
the
king
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
besought
him
with
tears
to
put
away
the
mischief
of
haman
the
agagite
and
his
device
that
he
had
devised
against
the
jews
8
4
then
the
king
held
out
the
golden
sceptre
toward
esther
so
esther
arose
and
stood
before
the
king
8
5
and
said
if
it
please
the
king
and
if
i
have
favour
in
his
sight
and
the
thing
seem
right
before
the
king
and
i
be
pleasing
in
his
eyes
let
it
be
written
to
reverse
the
letters
devised
by
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
which
he
wrote
to
destroy
the
jews
which
are
in
all
the
king’s
provinces
8
6
for
how
can
i
endure
to
see
the
evil
that
shall
come
unto
my
people
or
how
can
i
endure
to
see
the
destruction
of
my
kindred
8
7
then
the
king
ahasuerus
said
unto
esther
the
queen
and
to
mordecai
the
jew
behold
i
have
given
esther
the
house
of

and
him
they
have
hanged

write

which
is
written
in

and
sealed
with
the
king’s

king’s
commandment
and
his
decree
drew
near
to
be
put
in
execution
in
the
day
that
the
enemies
of
the
jews
hoped
to
have
power
over
them
(though
it
was
turned
to
the
contrary
that
the
jews
had
rule
over
them
that
hated
them
)
9
2
the
jews
gathered
themselves
together
in
their
cities
throughout
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
to
lay
hand
on
such
as
sought
their
hurt
and
no
man
could
withstand
them
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
all
people
9
3
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
and
the
lieutenants
and
the
deputies
and
officers
of
the
king
helped
the
jews
because
the
fear
of
mordecai
fell
upon
them
9
4
for
mordecai
was
great
in
the
king’s
house
and
his
fame
went
out
throughout
all
the
provinces
for
this
man
mordecai
waxed
greater
and
greater
9
5
thus
the
jews
smote
all
their
enemies
with
the
stroke
of
the
sword
and
slaughter
and
destruction
and
did
what
they
would
unto
those
that
hated
them
9
6
and
in
shushan
the
palace
the
jews
slew
and
destroyed
five
hundred
men
9
7
and
parshandatha
and
dalphon
and
aspatha
9
8
and
poratha
and
adalia
and
aridatha
9
9
and
parmashta
and
arisai
and
aridai
and
vajezatha
9
10
the
ten
sons
of
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
enemy
of
the
jews
slew
they
but
on
the
spoil
laid
they
not
their
hand
9
11
on
that
day
the
number
of
those
that
were
slain
in
shushan
the
palace
was
brought
before
the
king
9
12
and
the
king
said
unto
esther
the
queen
the
jews
have
slain
and
destroyed
five
hundred
men
in
shushan
the
palace
and
the
ten
sons
of
haman
what
have
they
done
in
the
rest
of
the
king’s
provinces
now
what
is
thy
petition
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee
or
what
is
thy
request
further
and
it
shall
be
done
9
13
then
said
esther
if
it
please
the
king
let
it
be
granted
to
the
jews
which
are
in
shushan
to
do
to
morrow
also
according
unto
this
day’s
decree
and
let
haman’s
ten
sons
be
hanged
upon
the
gallows
9
14
and
the
king
commanded
it
so
to
be
done
and
the
decree
was
given
at
shushan
and
they
hanged
haman’s
ten
sons
9
15
for
the
jews
that
were
in
shushan
gathered
themselves
together
on
the
fourteenth
day
also
of
the
month
adar
and
slew
three
hundred
men
at
shushan
but
on
the
prey
they
laid
not
their
hand
9
16
but
the
other
jews
that
were
in
the
king’s
provinces
gathered
themselves
together
and
stood
for
their
lives
and
had
rest
from
their
enemies
and
slew
of
their
foes
seventy
and
five
thousand
but
they
laid
not
their
hands
on
the
prey
9
17
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
rested
they
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness
9
18
but
the
jews
that
were
at
shushan
assembled
together
on
the
thirteenth
day
thereof
and
on
the
fourteenth
thereof
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
they
rested
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness
9
19
therefore
the
jews
of
the
villages
that
dwelt
in
the
unwalled
towns
made
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
a
day
of
gladness
and
feasting
and
a
good
day
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another
9
20
and
mordecai
wrote
these
things
and
sent
letters
unto
all
the
jews
that
were
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
both
nigh
and
far
9
21
to
stablish
this
among
them
that
they
should
keep
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
and
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
yearly
9
22
as
the
days
wherein
the
jews
rested
from
their
enemies
and
the
month
which
was
turned
unto
them
from
sorrow
to
joy
and
from
mourning
into
a
good
day
that
they
should
make
them
days
of
feasting
and
joy
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another
and
gifts
to
the
poor
9
23
and
the
jews
undertook
to
do
as
they
had
begun
and
as
mordecai
had
written
unto
them
9
24
because
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
the
enemy
of
all
the
jews
had
devised
against
the
jews
to
destroy
them
and
had
cast
pur
that
is
the
lot
to
consume
them
and
to
destroy
them
9
25
but
when
esther
came
before
the
king
he
commanded
by
letters
that
his
wicked
device
which
he
devised
against
the
jews
should
return
upon
his
own
head
and
that
he
and
his
sons
should
be
hanged
on
the
gallows
9
26
wherefore
they
called
these
days
purim
after
the
name
of
pur
therefore
for
all
the
words
of
this
letter
and
of
that
which
they
had
seen
concerning
this
matter
and
which
had
come
unto
them
9
27
the
jews
ordained
and
took
upon
them
and
upon
their
seed
and
upon
all
such
as
joined
themselves
unto
them
so
as
it
should
not
fail
that
they
would
keep
these
two
days
according
to
their
writing
and
according
to
their
appointed
time
every
year
9
28
and
that
these
days
should
be
remembered
and
kept
throughout
every
generation
every
family
every
province
and
every
city
and
that
these
days
of
purim
should
not
fail
from
among
the
jews
nor
the
memorial
of
them
perish
from
their
seed
9
29
then
esther
the
queen
the
daughter
of
abihail
and
mordecai
the
jew
wrote
with
all
authority
to
confirm
this
second
letter
of
purim
9
30
and
he
sent
the
letters
unto
all
the
jews
to
the
hundred
twenty
and
seven
provinces
of
the
kingdom
of
ahasuerus
with
words
of
peace
and
truth
9
31
to
confirm
these
days
of
purim
in
their
times
appointed
according
as
mordecai
the
jew
and
esther
the
queen
had
enjoined
them
and
as
they
had
decreed
for
themselves
and
for
their
seed
the
matters
of
the
fastings
and
their
cry
9
32
and
the
decree
of
esther
confirmed
these
matters
of
purim
and
it
was
written
in
the
book
10
1
and
the
king
ahasuerus
laid
a
tribute
upon
the
land
and
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
10
2
and
all
the
acts
of
his
power
and
of
his
might
and
the
declaration
of
the
greatness
of
mordecai
whereunto
the
king
advanced
him
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
media
and
persia
10
3
for
mordecai
the
jew
was
next
unto
king
ahasuerus
and
great
among
the
jews
and
accepted
of
the
multitude
of
his
brethren
seeking
the
wealth
of
his
people
and
speaking
peace
to
all
his
seed
the
book
of
job
1
1
there
was
a
man
in
the
land
of
uz
whose
name
was
job
and
that
man
was
perfect
and
upright
and
one
that
feared
god
and
eschewed
evil
1
2
and
there
were
born
unto
him
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
1
3
his
substance
also
was
seven
thousand
sheep
and
three
thousand
camels
and
five
hundred
yoke
of
oxen
and
five
hundred
she
asses
and
a
very
great
household
so
that
this
man
was
the
greatest
of
all
the
men
of
the
east
1
4
and
his
sons
went
and
feasted
in
their
houses
every
one
his
day
and
sent
and
called
for
their
three
sisters
to
eat
and
to
drink
with
them
1
5
and
it
was
so
when
the
days
of
their
feasting
were
gone
about
that
job
sent
and
sanctified
them
and
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
offered
burnt
offerings
according
to
the
number
of
them
all
for
job
said
it
may
be
that
my
sons
have
sinned
and
cursed
god
in
their
hearts
thus
did
job
continually
1
6
now
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
god
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
lord
and
satan
came
also
among
them
1
7
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
whence
comest
thou
then
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
1
8
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man
one
that
feareth
god
and
escheweth
evil
1
9
then
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
doth
job
fear
god
for
nought
1
10
hast
not
thou
made
an
hedge
about
him
and
about
his
house
and
about
all
that
he
hath
on
every
side
thou
hast
blessed
the
work
of
his
hands
and
his
substance
is
increased
in
the
land
1
11
but
put
forth
thine
hand
now
and
touch
all
that
he
hath
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face
1
12
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
behold
all
that
he
hath
is
in
thy
power
only
upon
himself
put
not
forth
thine
hand
so
satan
went
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
1
13
and
there
was
a
day
when
his
sons
and
his
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother’s
house
1
14
and
there
came
a
messenger
unto
job
and
said
the
oxen
were
plowing
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them
1
15
and
the
sabeans
fell
upon
them
and
took
them
away
yea
they
have
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
1
16
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
fire
of
god
is
fallen
from
heaven
and
hath
burned
up
the
sheep
and
the
servants
and
consumed
them
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
1
17
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
chaldeans
made
out
three
bands
and
fell
upon
the
camels
and
have
carried
them
away
yea
and
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
1
18
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother’s
house
1
19
and
behold
there
came
a
great
wind
from
the
wilderness
and
smote
the
four
corners
of
the
house
and
it
fell
upon
the
young
men
and
they
are
dead
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
1
20
then
job
arose
and
rent
his
mantle
and
shaved
his
head
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
worshipped
1
21
and
said
naked
came
i
out
of
my
mother’s
womb
and
naked
shall
i
return
thither
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
1
22
in
all
this
job
sinned
not
nor
charged
god
foolishly
2
1
again
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
god
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
lord
and
satan
came
also
among
them
to
present
himself
before
the
lord
2
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
from
whence
comest
thou
and
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
2
3
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man
one
that
feareth
god
and
escheweth
evil
and
still
he
holdeth
fast
his
integrity
although
thou
movedst
me
against
him
to
destroy
him
without
cause
2
4
and
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
skin
for
skin
yea
all
that
a
man
hath
will
he
give
for
his
life
2
5
but
put
forth
thine
hand
now
and
touch
his
bone
and
his
flesh
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face
2
6
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
behold
he
is
in
thine
hand
but
save
his
life
2
7
so
went
satan
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
smote
job
with
sore
boils
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
unto
his
crown
2
8
and
he
took
him
a
potsherd
to
scrape
himself
withal
and
he
sat
down
among
the
ashes
2
9
then
said
his
wife
unto
him
dost
thou
still
retain
thine
integrity
curse
god
and
die
2
10
but
he
said
unto
her
thou
speakest
as
one
of
the
foolish
women
speaketh
what
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
god
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil
in
all
this
did
not
job
sin
with
his
lips
2
11
now
when
job’s
three
friends
heard
of
all
this
evil
that
was
come
upon
him
they
came
every
one
from
his
own
place
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
bildad
the
shuhite
and
zophar
the
naamathite
for
they
had
made
an
appointment
together
to
come
to
mourn
with
him
and
to
comfort
him
2
12
and
when
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
afar
off
and
knew
him
not
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
they
rent
every
one
his
mantle
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
their
heads
toward
heaven
2
13
so
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
none
spake
a
word
unto
him
for
they
saw
that
his
grief
was
very
great
3
1
after
this
opened
job
his
mouth
and
cursed
his
day
3
2
and
job
spake
and
said
3
3
let
the
day
perish
wherein
i
was
born
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
said
there
is
a
man
child
conceived
3
4
let
that
day
be
darkness
let
not
god
regard
it
from
above
neither
let
the
light
shine
upon
it
3
5
let
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
stain
it
let
a
cloud
dwell
upon
it
let
the
blackness
of
the
day
terrify
it
3
6
as
for
that
night
let
darkness
seize
upon
it
let
it
not
be
joined
unto
the
days
of
the
year
let
it
not
come
into
the
number
of
the
months
3
7
lo
let
that
night
be
solitary
let
no
joyful
voice
come
therein
3
8
let
them
curse
it
that
curse
the
day
who
are
ready
to
raise
up
their
mourning
3
9
let
the
stars
of
the
twilight
thereof
be
dark
let
it
look
for
light
but
have
none
neither
let
it
see
the
dawning
of
the
day
3
10
because
it
shut
not
up
the
doors
of
my
mother’s
womb
nor
hid
sorrow
from
mine
eyes
3
11
why
died
i
not
from
the
womb
why
did
i
not
give
up
the
ghost
when
i
came
out
of
the
belly
3
12
why
did
the
knees
prevent
me
or
why
the
breasts
that
i
should
suck
3
13
for
now
should
i
have
lain
still
and
been
quiet
i
should
have
slept
then
had
i
been
at
rest
3
14
with
kings
and
counsellors
of
the
earth
which
build
desolate
places
for
themselves
3
15
or
with
princes
that
had
gold
who
filled
their
houses
with
silver
3
16
or
as
an
hidden
untimely
birth
i
had
not
been
as
infants
which
never
saw
light
3
17
there
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest
3
18
there
the
prisoners
rest
together
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor
3
19
the
small
and
great
are
there
and
the
servant
is
free
from
his
master
3
20
wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
misery
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
soul
3
21
which
long
for
death
but
it
cometh
not
and
dig
for
it
more
than
for
hid
treasures
3
22
which
rejoice
exceedingly
and
are
glad
when
they
can
find
the
grave
3
23
why
is
light
given
to
a
man
whose
way
is
hid
and
whom
god
hath
hedged
in
3
24
for
my
sighing
cometh
before
i
eat
and
my
roarings
are
poured
out
like
the
waters
3
25
for
the
thing
which
i
greatly
feared
is
come
upon
me
and
that
which
i
was
afraid
of
is
come
unto
me
3
26
i
was
not
in
safety
neither
had
i
rest
neither
was
i
quiet
yet
trouble
came
4
1
then
eliphaz
the
temanite
answered
and
said
4
2
if
we
assay
to
commune
with
thee
wilt
thou
be
grieved
but
who
can
withhold
himself
from
speaking
4
3
behold
thou
hast
instructed
many
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
weak
hands
4
4
thy
words
have
upholden
him
that
was
falling
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
feeble
knees
4
5
but
now
it
is
come
upon
thee
and
thou
faintest
it
toucheth
thee
and
thou
art
troubled
4
6
is
not
this
thy
fear
thy
confidence
thy
hope
and
the
uprightness
of
thy
ways
4
7
remember
i
pray
thee
who
ever
perished
being
innocent
or
where
were
the
righteous
cut
off
4
8
even
as
i
have
seen
they
that
plow
iniquity
and
sow
wickedness
reap
the
same
4
9
by
the
blast
of
god
they
perish
and
by
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
are
they
consumed
4
10
the
roaring
of
the
lion
and
the
voice
of
the
fierce
lion
and
the
teeth
of
the
young
lions
are
broken
4
11
the
old
lion
perisheth
for
lack
of
prey
and
the
stout
lion’s
whelps
are
scattered
abroad
4
12
now
a
thing
was
secretly
brought
to
me
and
mine
ear
received
a
little
thereof
4
13
in
thoughts
from
the
visions
of
the
night
when
deep
sleep
falleth
on
men
4
14
fear
came
upon
me
and
trembling
which
made
all
my
bones
to
shake
4
15
then
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up
4
16
it
stood
still
but
i
could
not
discern
the
form
thereof
an
image
was
before
mine
eyes
there
was
silence
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
4
17
shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than
god
shall
a
man
be
more
pure
than
his
maker
4
18
behold
he
put
no
trust
in
his
servants
and
his
angels
he
charged
with
folly
4
19
how
much
less
in
them
that
dwell
in
houses
of
clay
whose
foundation
is
in
the
dust
which
are
crushed
before
the
moth
4
20
they
are
destroyed
from
morning
to
evening
they
perish
for
ever
without
any
regarding
it
4
21
doth
not
their
excellency
which
is
in
them
go
away
they
die
even
without
wisdom
5
1
call
now
if
there
be
any
that
will
answer
thee
and
to
which
of
the
saints
wilt
thou
turn
5
2
for
wrath
killeth
the
foolish
man
and
envy
slayeth
the
silly
one
5
3
i
have
seen
the
foolish
taking
root
but
suddenly
i
cursed
his
habitation
5
4
his
children
are
far
from
safety
and
they
are
crushed
in
the
gate
neither
is
there
any
to
deliver
them
5
5
whose
harvest
the
hungry
eateth
up
and
taketh
it
even
out
of
the
thorns
and
the
robber
swalloweth
up
their
substance
5
6
although
affliction
cometh
not
forth
of
the
dust
neither
doth
trouble
spring
out
of
the
ground
5
7
yet
man
is
born
unto
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
5
8
i
would
seek
unto
god
and
unto
god
would
i
commit
my
cause
5
9
which
doeth
great
things
and
unsearchable
marvellous
things
without
number
5
10
who
giveth
rain
upon
the
earth
and
sendeth
waters
upon
the
fields
5
11
to
set
up
on
high
those
that
be
low
that
those
which
mourn
may
be
exalted
to
safety
5
12
he
disappointeth
the
devices
of
the
crafty
so
that
their
hands
cannot
perform
their
enterprise
5
13
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
and
the
counsel
of
the
froward
is
carried
headlong
5
14
they
meet
with
darkness
in
the
day
time
and
grope
in
the
noonday
as
in
the
night
5
15
but
he
saveth
the
poor
from
the
sword
from
their
mouth
and
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty
5
16
so
the
poor
hath
hope
and
iniquity
stoppeth
her
mouth
5
17
behold
happy
is
the
man
whom
god
correcteth
therefore
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
almighty
5
18
for
he
maketh
sore
and
bindeth
up
he
woundeth
and
his
hands
make
whole
5
19
he
shall
deliver
thee
in
six
troubles
yea
in
seven
there
shall
no
evil
touch
thee
5
20
in
famine
he
shall
redeem
thee
from
death
and
in
war
from
the
power
of
the
sword
5
21
thou
shalt
be
hid
from
the
scourge
of
the
tongue
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
destruction
when
it
cometh
5
22
at
destruction
and
famine
thou
shalt
laugh
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
the
beasts
of
the
earth
5
23
for
thou
shalt
be
in
league
with
the
stones
of
the
field
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
at
peace
with
thee
5
24
and
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
tabernacle
shall
be
in
peace
and
thou
shalt
visit
thy
habitation
and
shalt
not
sin
5
25
thou
shalt
know
also
that
thy
seed
shall
be
great
and
thine
offspring
as
the
grass
of
the
earth
5
26
thou
shalt
come
to
thy
grave
in
a
full
age
like
as
a
shock
of
corn
cometh
in
in
his
season
5
27
lo
this
we
have
searched
it
so
it
is
hear
it
and
know
thou
it
for
thy
good
6
1
but
job
answered
and
said
6
2
oh
that
my
grief
were
throughly
weighed
and
my
calamity
laid
in
the
balances
together
6
3
for
now
it
would
be
heavier
than
the
sand
of
the
sea
therefore
my
words
are
swallowed
up
6
4
for
the
arrows
of
the
almighty
are
within
me
the
poison
whereof
drinketh
up
my
spirit
the
terrors
of
god
do
set
themselves
in
array
against
me
6
5
doth
the
wild
ass
bray
when
he
hath
grass
or
loweth
the
ox
over
his
fodder
6
6
can
that
which
is
unsavoury
be
eaten
without
salt
or
is
there
any
taste
in
the
white
of
an
egg
6
7
the
things
that
my
soul
refused
to
touch
are
as
my
sorrowful
meat
6
8
oh
that
i
might
have
my
request
and
that
god
would
grant
me
the
thing
that
i
long
for
6
9
even
that
it
would
please
god
to
destroy
me
that
he
would
let
loose
his
hand
and
cut
me
off
6
10
then
should
i
yet
have
comfort
yea
i
would
harden
myself
in
sorrow
let
him
not
spare
for
i
have
not
concealed
the
words
of
the
holy
one
6
11
what
is
my
strength
that
i
should
hope
and
what
is
mine
end
that
i
should
prolong
my
life
6
12
is
my
strength
the
strength
of
stones
or
is
my
flesh
of
brass
6
13
is
not
my
help
in
me
and
is
wisdom
driven
quite
from
me
6
14
to
him
that
is
afflicted
pity
should
be
shewed
from
his
friend
but
he
forsaketh
the
fear
of
the
almighty
6
15
my
brethren
have
dealt
deceitfully
as
a
brook
and
as
the
stream
of
brooks
they
pass
away
6
16
which
are
blackish
by
reason
of
the
ice
and
wherein
the
snow
is
hid
6
17
what
time
they
wax
warm
they
vanish
when
it
is
hot
they
are
consumed
out
of
their
place
6
18
the
paths
of
their
way
are
turned
aside
they
go
to
nothing
and
perish
6
19
the
troops
of
tema
looked
the
companies
of
sheba
waited
for
them
6
20
they
were
confounded
because
they
had
hoped
they
came
thither
and
were
ashamed
6
21
for
now
ye
are
nothing
ye
see
my
casting
down
and
are
afraid
6
22
did
i
say
bring
unto
me
or
give
a
reward
for
me
of
your
substance
6
23
or
deliver
me
from
the
enemy’s
hand
or
redeem
me
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty
6
24
teach
me
and
i
will
hold
my
tongue
and
cause
me
to
understand
wherein
i
have
erred
6
25
how
forcible
are
right
words
but
what
doth
your
arguing
reprove
6
26
do
ye
imagine
to
reprove
words
and
the
speeches
of
one
that
is
desperate
which
are
as
wind
6
27
yea
ye
overwhelm
the
fatherless
and
ye
dig
a
pit
for
your
friend
6
28
now
therefore
be
content
look
upon
me
for
it
is
evident
unto
you
if
i
lie
6
29
return
i
pray
you
let
it
not
be
iniquity
yea
return
again
my
righteousness
is
in
it
6
30
is
there
iniquity
in
my
tongue
cannot
my
taste
discern
perverse
things
7
1
is
there
not
an
appointed
time
to
man
upon
earth
are
not
his
days
also
like
the
days
of
an
hireling
7
2
as
a
servant
earnestly
desireth
the
shadow
and
as
an
hireling
looketh
for
the
reward
of
his
work
7
3
so
am
i
made
to
possess
months
of
vanity
and
wearisome
nights
are
appointed
to
me
7
4
when
i
lie
down
i
say
when
shall
i
arise
and
the
night
be
gone
and
i
am
full
of
tossings
to
and
fro
unto
the
dawning
of
the
day
7
5
my
flesh
is
clothed
with
worms
and
clods
of
dust
my
skin
is
broken
and
become
loathsome
7
6
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
weaver’s
shuttle
and
are
spent
without
hope
7
7
o
remember
that
my
life
is
wind
mine
eye
shall
no
more
see
good
7
8
the
eye
of
him
that
hath
seen
me
shall
see
me
no
more
thine
eyes
are
upon
me
and
i
am
not
7
9
as
the
cloud
is
consumed
and
vanisheth
away
so
he
that
goeth
down
to
the
grave
shall
come
up
no
more
7
10
he
shall
return
no
more
to
his
house
neither
shall
his
place
know
him
any
more
7
11
therefore
i
will
not
refrain
my
mouth
i
will
speak
in
the
anguish
of
my
spirit
i
will
complain
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
7
12
am
i
a
sea
or
a
whale
that
thou
settest
a
watch
over
me
7
13
when
i
say
my
bed
shall
comfort
me
my
couch
shall
ease
my
complaints
7
14
then
thou
scarest
me
with
dreams
and
terrifiest
me
through
visions
7
15
so
that
my
soul
chooseth
strangling
and
death
rather
than
my
life
7
16
i
loathe
it
i
would
not
live
alway
let
me
alone
for
my
days
are
vanity
7
17
what
is
man
that
thou
shouldest
magnify
him
and
that
thou
shouldest
set
thine
heart
upon
him
7
18
and
that
thou
shouldest
visit
him
every
morning
and
try
him
every
moment
7
19
how
long
wilt
thou
not
depart
from
me
nor
let
me
alone
till
i
swallow
down
my
spittle
7
20
i
have
sinned
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
o
thou
preserver
of
men
why
hast
thou
set
me
as
a
mark
against
thee
so
that
i
am
a
burden
to
myself
7
21
and
why
dost
thou
not
pardon
my
transgression
and
take
away
my
iniquity
for
now
shall
i
sleep
in
the
dust
and
thou
shalt
seek
me
in
the
morning
but
i
shall
not
be
8
1
then
answered
bildad
the
shuhite
and
said
8
2
how
long
wilt
thou
speak
these
things
and
how
long
shall
the
words
of
thy
mouth
be
like
a
strong
wind
8
3
doth
god
pervert
judgment
or
doth
the
almighty
pervert
justice
8
4
if
thy
children
have
sinned
against
him
and
he
have
cast
them
away
for
their
transgression
8
5
if
thou
wouldest
seek
unto
god
betimes
and
make
thy
supplication
to
the
almighty
8
6
if
thou
wert
pure
and
upright
surely
now
he
would
awake
for
thee
and
make
the
habitation
of
thy
righteousness
prosperous
8
7
though
thy
beginning
was
small
yet
thy
latter
end
should
greatly
increase
8
8
for
enquire
i
pray
thee
of
the
former
age
and
prepare
thyself
to
the
search
of
their
fathers
8
9
(for
we
are
but
of
yesterday
and
know
nothing
because
our
days
upon
earth
are
a
shadow
)
8
10
shall
not
they
teach
thee
and
tell
thee
and
utter
words
out
of
their
heart
8
11
can
the
rush
grow
up
without
mire
can
the
flag
grow
without
water
8
12
whilst
it
is
yet
in
his
greenness
and
not
cut
down
it
withereth
before
any
other
herb
8
13
so
are
the
paths
of
all
that
forget
god
and
the
hypocrite’s
hope
shall
perish
8
14
whose
hope
shall
be
cut
off
and
whose
trust
shall
be
a
spider’s
web
8
15
he
shall
lean
upon
his
house
but
it
shall
not
stand
he
shall
hold
it
fast
but
it
shall
not
endure
8
16
he
is
green
before
the
sun
and
his
branch
shooteth
forth
in
his
garden
8
17
his
roots
are
wrapped
about
the
heap
and
seeth
the
place
of
stones
8
18
if
he
destroy
him
from
his
place
then
it
shall
deny
him
saying
i
have
not
seen
thee
8
19
behold
this
is
the
joy
of
his
way
and
out
of
the
earth
shall
others
grow
8
20
behold
god
will
not
cast
away
a
perfect
man
neither
will
he
help
the
evil
doers
8
21
till
he
fill
thy
mouth
with
laughing
and
thy
lips
with
rejoicing
8
22
they
that
hate
thee
shall
be
clothed
with
shame
and
the
dwelling
place
of
the
wicked
shall
come
to
nought
9
1
then
job
answered
and
said
9
2
i
know
it
is
so
of
a
truth
but
how
should
man
be
just
with
god
9
3
if
he
will
contend
with
him
he
cannot
answer
him
one
of
a
thousand
9
4
he
is
wise
in
heart
and
mighty
in
strength
who
hath
hardened
himself
against
him
and
hath
prospered
9
5
which
removeth
the
mountains
and
they
know
not
which
overturneth
them
in
his
anger
9
6
which
shaketh
the
earth
out
of
her
place
and
the
pillars
thereof
tremble
9
7
which
commandeth
the
sun
and
it
riseth
not
and
sealeth
up
the
stars
9
8
which
alone
spreadeth
out
the
heavens
and
treadeth
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea
9
9
which
maketh
arcturus
orion
and
pleiades
and
the
chambers
of
the
south
9
10
which
doeth
great
things
past
finding
out
yea
and
wonders
without
number
9
11
lo
he
goeth
by
me
and
i
see
him
not
he
passeth
on
also
but
i
perceive
him
not
9
12
behold
he
taketh
away
who
can
hinder
him
who
will
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
9
13
if
god
will
not
withdraw
his
anger
the
proud
helpers
do
stoop
under
him
9
14
how
much
less
shall
i
answer
him
and
choose
out
my
words
to
reason
with
him
9
15
whom
though
i
were
righteous
yet
would
i
not
answer
but
i
would
make
supplication
to
my
judge
9
16
if
i
had
called
and
he
had
answered
me
yet
would
i
not
believe
that
he
had
hearkened
unto
my
voice
9
17
for
he
breaketh
me
with
a
tempest
and
multiplieth
my
wounds
without
cause
9
18
he
will
not
suffer
me
to
take
my
breath
but
filleth
me
with
bitterness
9
19
if
i
speak
of
strength
lo
he
is
strong
and
if
of
judgment
who
shall
set
me
a
time
to
plead
9
20
if
i
justify
myself
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
me
if
i
say
i
am
perfect
it
shall
also
prove
me
perverse
9
21
though
i
were
perfect
yet
would
i
not
know
my
soul
i
would
despise
my
life
9
22
this
is
one
thing
therefore
i
said
it
he
destroyeth
the
perfect
and
the
wicked
9
23
if
the
scourge
slay
suddenly
he
will
laugh
at
the
trial
of
the
innocent
9
24
the
earth
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
wicked
he
covereth
the
faces
of
the
judges
thereof
if
not
where
and
who
is
he
9
25
now
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
post
they
flee
away
they
see
no
good
9
26
they
are
passed
away
as
the
swift
ships
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
the
prey
9
27
if
i
say
i
will
forget
my
complaint
i
will
leave
off
my
heaviness
and
comfort
myself
9
28
i
am
afraid
of
all
my
sorrows
i
know
that
thou
wilt
not
hold
me
innocent
9
29
if
i
be
wicked
why
then
labour
i
in
vain
9
30
if
i
wash
myself
with
snow
water
and
make
my
hands
never
so
clean
9
31
yet
shalt
thou
plunge
me
in
the
ditch
and
mine
own
clothes
shall
abhor
me
9
32
for
he
is
not
a
man
as
i
am
that
i
should
answer
him
and
we
should
come
together
in
judgment
9
33
neither
is
there
any
daysman
betwixt
us
that
might
lay
his
hand
upon
us
both
9
34
let
him
take
his
rod
away
from
me
and
let
not
his
fear
terrify
me
9
35
then
would
i
speak
and
not
fear
him
but
it
is
not
so
with
me
10
1
my
soul
is
weary
of
my
life
i
will
leave
my
complaint
upon
myself
i
will
speak
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
10
2
i
will
say
unto
god
do
not
condemn
me
shew
me
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
me
10
3
is
it
good
unto
thee
that
thou
shouldest
oppress
that
thou
shouldest
despise
the
work
of
thine
hands
and
shine
upon
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
10
4
hast
thou
eyes
of
flesh
or
seest
thou
as
man
seeth
10
5
are
thy
days
as
the
days
of
man
are
thy
years
as
man’s
days
10
6
that
thou
enquirest
after
mine
iniquity
and
searchest
after
my
sin
10
7
thou
knowest
that
i
am
not
wicked
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
thine
hand
10
8
thine
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me
together
round
about
yet
thou
dost
destroy
me
10
9
remember
i
beseech
thee
that
thou
hast
made
me
as
the
clay
and
wilt
thou
bring
me
into
dust
again
10
10
hast
thou
not
poured
me
out
as
milk
and
curdled
me
like
cheese
10
11
thou
hast
clothed
me
with
skin
and
flesh
and
hast
fenced
me
with
bones
and
sinews
10
12
thou
hast
granted
me
life
and
favour
and
thy
visitation
hath
preserved
my
spirit
10
13
and
these
things
hast
thou
hid
in
thine
heart
i
know
that
this
is
with
thee
10
14
if
i
sin
then
thou
markest
me
and
thou
wilt
not
acquit
me
from
mine
iniquity
10
15
if
i
be
wicked
woe
unto
me
and
if
i
be
righteous
yet
will
i
not
lift
up
my
head
i
am
full
of
confusion
therefore
see
thou
mine
affliction
10
16
for
it
increaseth
thou
huntest
me
as
a
fierce
lion
and
again
thou
shewest
thyself
marvellous
upon
me
10
17
thou
renewest
thy
witnesses
against
me
and
increasest
thine
indignation
upon
me
changes
and
war
are
against
me
10
18
wherefore
then
hast
thou
brought
me
forth
out
of
the
womb
oh
that
i
had
given
up
the
ghost
and
no
eye
had
seen
me
10
19
i
should
have
been
as
though
i
had
not
been
i
should
have
been
carried
from
the
womb
to
the
grave
10
20
are
not
my
days
few
cease
then
and
let
me
alone
that
i
may
take
comfort
a
little
10
21
before
i
go
whence
i
shall
not
return
even
to
the
land
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
10
22
a
land
of
darkness
as
darkness
itself
and
of
the
shadow
of
death
without
any
order
and
where
the
light
is
as
darkness
11
1
then
answered
zophar
the
naamathite
and
said
11
2
should
not
the
multitude
of
words
be
answered
and
should
a
man
full
of
talk
be
justified
11
3
should
thy
lies
make
men
hold
their
peace
and
when
thou
mockest
shall
no
man
make
thee
ashamed
11
4
for
thou
hast
said
my
doctrine
is
pure
and
i
am
clean
in
thine
eyes
11
5
but
oh
that
god
would
speak
and
open
his
lips
against
thee
11
6
and
that
he
would
shew
thee
the
secrets
of
wisdom
that
they
are
double
to
that
which
is
know
therefore
that
god
exacteth
of
thee
less
than
thine
iniquity
deserveth
11
7
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
god
canst
thou
find
out
the
almighty
unto
perfection
11
8
it
is
as
high
as
heaven
what
canst
thou
do
deeper
than
hell
what
canst
thou
know
11
9
the
measure
thereof
is
longer
than
the
earth
and
broader
than
the
sea
11
10
if
he
cut
off
and
shut
up
or
gather
together
then
who
can
hinder
him
11
11
for
he
knoweth
vain
men
he
seeth
wickedness
also
will
he
not
then
consider
it
11
12
for
vain
men
would
be
wise
though
man
be
born
like
a
wild
ass’s
colt
11
13
if
thou
prepare
thine
heart
and
stretch
out
thine
hands
toward
him
11
14
if
iniquity
be
in
thine
hand
put
it
far
away
and
let
not
wickedness
dwell
in
thy
tabernacles
11
15
for
then
shalt
thou
lift
up
thy
face
without
spot
yea
thou
shalt
be
stedfast
and
shalt
not
fear
11
16
because
thou
shalt
forget
thy
misery
and
remember
it
as
waters
that
pass
away
11
17
and
thine
age
shall
be
clearer
than
the
noonday
thou
shalt
shine
forth
thou
shalt
be
as
the
morning
11
18
and
thou
shalt
be
secure
because
there
is
hope
yea
thou
shalt
dig
about
thee
and
thou
shalt
take
thy
rest
in
safety
11
19
also
thou
shalt
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
thee
afraid
yea
many
shall
make
suit
unto
thee
11
20
but
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
shall
fail
and
they
shall
not
escape
and
their
hope
shall
be
as
the
giving
up
of
the
ghost
12
1
and
job
answered
and
said
12
2
no
doubt
but
ye
are
the
people
and
wisdom
shall
die
with
you
12
3
but
i
have
understanding
as
well
as
you
i
am
not
inferior
to
you
yea
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
these
12
4
i
am
as
one
mocked
of
his
neighbour
who
calleth
upon
god
and
he
answereth
him
the
just
upright
man
is
laughed
to
scorn
12
5
he
that
is
ready
to
slip
with
his
feet
is
as
a
lamp
despised
in
the
thought
of
him
that
is
at
ease
12
6
the
tabernacles
of
robbers
prosper
and
they
that
provoke
god
are
secure
into
whose
hand
god
bringeth
abundantly
12
7
but
ask
now
the
beasts
and
they
shall
teach
thee
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
they
shall
tell
thee
12
8
or
speak
to
the
earth
and
it
shall
teach
thee
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
shall
declare
unto
thee
12
9
who
knoweth
not
in
all
these
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
hath
wrought
this
12
10
in
whose
hand
is
the
soul
of
every
living
thing
and
the
breath
of
all
mankind
12
11
doth
not
the
ear
try
words
and
the
mouth
taste
his
meat
12
12
with
the
ancient
is
wisdom
and
in
length
of
days
understanding
12
13
with
him
is
wisdom
and
strength
he
hath
counsel
and
understanding
12
14
behold
he
breaketh
down
and
it
cannot
be
built
again
he
shutteth
up
a
man
and
there
can
be
no
opening
12
15
behold
he
withholdeth
the
waters
and
they
dry
up
also
he
sendeth
them
out
and
they
overturn
the
earth
12
16
with
him
is
strength
and
wisdom
the
deceived
and
the
deceiver
are
his
12
17
he
leadeth
counsellors
away
spoiled
and
maketh
the
judges
fools
12
18
he
looseth
the
bond
of
kings
and
girdeth
their
loins
with
a
girdle
12
19
he
leadeth
princes
away
spoiled
and
overthroweth
the
mighty
12
20
he
removeth
away
the
speech
of
the
trusty
and
taketh
away
the
understanding
of
the
aged
12
21
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
weakeneth
the
strength
of
the
mighty
12
22
he
discovereth
deep
things
out
of
darkness
and
bringeth
out
to
light
the
shadow
of
death
12
23
he
increaseth
the
nations
and
destroyeth
them
he
enlargeth
the
nations
and
straiteneth
them
again
12
24
he
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
of
the
people
of
the
earth
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way
12
25
they
grope
in
the
dark
without
light
and
he
maketh
them
to
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
13
1
lo
mine
eye
hath
seen
all
this
mine
ear
hath
heard
and
understood
it
13
2
what
ye
know
the
same
do
i
know
also
i
am
not
inferior
unto
you
13
3
surely
i
would
speak
to
the
almighty
and
i
desire
to
reason
with
god
13
4
but
ye
are
forgers
of
lies
ye
are
all
physicians
of
no
value
13
5
o
that
ye
would
altogether
hold
your
peace
and
it
should
be
your
wisdom
13
6
hear
now
my
reasoning
and
hearken
to
the
pleadings
of
my
lips
13
7
will
ye
speak
wickedly
for
god
and
talk
deceitfully
for
him
13
8
will
ye
accept
his
person
will
ye
contend
for
god
13
9
is
it
good
that
he
should
search
you
out
or
as
one
man
mocketh
another
do
ye
so
mock
him
13
10
he
will
surely
reprove
you
if
ye
do
secretly
accept
persons
13
11
shall
not
his
excellency
make
you
afraid
and
his
dread
fall
upon
you
13
12
your
remembrances
are
like
unto
ashes
your
bodies
to
bodies
of
clay
13
13
hold
your
peace
let
me
alone
that
i
may
speak
and
let
come
on
me
what
will
13
14
wherefore
do
i
take
my
flesh
in
my
teeth
and
put
my
life
in
mine
hand
13
15
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
but
i
will
maintain
mine
own
ways
before
him
13
16
he
also
shall
be
my
salvation
for
an
hypocrite
shall
not
come
before
him
13
17
hear
diligently
my
speech
and
my
declaration
with
your
ears
13
18
behold
now
i
have
ordered
my
cause
i
know
that
i
shall
be
justified
13
19
who
is
he
that
will
plead
with
me
for
now
if
i
hold
my
tongue
i
shall
give
up
the
ghost
13
20
only
do
not
two
things
unto
me
then
will
i
not
hide
myself
from
thee
13
21
withdraw
thine
hand
far
from
me
and
let
not
thy
dread
make
me
afraid
13
22
then
call
thou
and
i
will
answer
or
let
me
speak
and
answer
thou
me
13
23
how
many
are
mine
iniquities
and
sins
make
me
to
know
my
transgression
and
my
sin
13
24
wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face
and
holdest
me
for
thine
enemy
13
25
wilt
thou
break
a
leaf
driven
to
and
fro
and
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry
stubble
13
26
for
thou
writest
bitter
things
against
me
and
makest
me
to
possess
the
iniquities
of
my
youth
13
27
thou
puttest
my
feet
also
in
the
stocks
and
lookest
narrowly
unto
all
my
paths
thou
settest
a
print
upon
the
heels
of
my
feet
13
28
and
he
as
a
rotten
thing
consumeth
as
a
garment
that
is
moth
eaten
14
1
man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
14
2
he
cometh
forth
like
a
flower
and
is
cut
down
he
fleeth
also
as
a
shadow
and
continueth
not
14
3
and
doth
thou
open
thine
eyes
upon
such
an
one
and
bringest
me
into
judgment
with
thee
14
4
who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean
not
one
14
5
seeing
his
days
are
determined
the
number
of
his
months
are
with
thee
thou
hast
appointed
his
bounds
that
he
cannot
pass
14
6
turn
from
him
that
he
may
rest
till
he
shall
accomplish
as
an
hireling
his
day
14
7
for
there
is
hope
of
a
tree
if
it
be
cut
down
that
it
will
sprout
again
and
that
the
tender
branch
thereof
will
not
cease
14
8
though
the
root
thereof
wax
old
in
the
earth
and
the
stock
thereof
die
in
the
ground
14
9
yet
through
the
scent
of
water
it
will
bud
and
bring
forth
boughs
like
a
plant
14
10
but
man
dieth
and
wasteth
away
yea
man
giveth
up
the
ghost
and
where
is
he
14
11
as
the
waters
fail
from
the
sea
and
the
flood
decayeth
and
drieth
up
14
12
so
man
lieth
down
and
riseth
not
till
the
heavens
be
no
more
they
shall
not
awake
nor
be
raised
out
of
their
sleep
14
13
o
that
thou
wouldest
hide
me
in
the
grave
that
thou
wouldest
keep
me
secret
until
thy
wrath
be
past
that
thou
wouldest
appoint
me
a
set
time
and
remember
me
14
14
if
a
man
die
shall
he
live
again
all
the
days
of
my
appointed
time
will
i
wait
till
my
change
come
14
15
thou
shalt
call
and
i
will
answer
thee
thou
wilt
have
a
desire
to
the
work
of
thine
hands
14
16
for
now
thou
numberest
my
steps
dost
thou
not
watch
over
my
sin
14
17
my
transgression
is
sealed
up
in
a
bag
and
thou
sewest
up
mine
iniquity
14
18
and
surely
the
mountains
falling
cometh
to
nought
and
the
rock
is
removed
out
of
his
place
14
19
the
waters
wear
the
stones
thou
washest
away
the
things
which
grow
out
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
thou
destroyest
the
hope
of
man
14
20
thou
prevailest
for
ever
against
him
and
he
passeth
thou
changest
his
countenance
and
sendest
him
away
14
21
his
sons
come
to
honour
and
he
knoweth
it
not
and
they
are
brought
low
but
he
perceiveth
it
not
of
them
14
22
but
his
flesh
upon
him
shall
have
pain
and
his
soul
within
him
shall
mourn
15
1
then
answered
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
said
15
2
should
a
wise
man
utter
vain
knowledge
and
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
wind
15
3
should
he
reason
with
unprofitable
talk
or
with
speeches
wherewith
he
can
do
no
good
15
4
yea
thou
castest
off
fear
and
restrainest
prayer
before
god
15
5
for
thy
mouth
uttereth
thine
iniquity
and
thou
choosest
the
tongue
of
the
crafty
15
6
thine
own
mouth
condemneth
thee
and
not
i
yea
thine
own
lips
testify
against
thee
15
7
art
thou
the
first
man
that
was
born
or
wast
thou
made
before
the
hills
15
8
hast
thou
heard
the
secret
of
god
and
dost
thou
restrain
wisdom
to
thyself
15
9
what
knowest
thou
that
we
know
not
what
understandest
thou
which
is
not
in
us
15
10
with
us
are
both
the
grayheaded
and
very
aged
men
much
elder
than
thy
father
15
11
are
the
consolations
of
god
small
with
thee
is
there
any
secret
thing
with
thee
15
12
why
doth
thine
heart
carry
thee
away
and
what
do
thy
eyes
wink
at
15
13
that
thou
turnest
thy
spirit
against
god
and
lettest
such
words
go
out
of
thy
mouth
15
14
what
is
man
that
he
should
be
clean
and
he
which
is
born
of
a
woman
that
he
should
be
righteous
15
15
behold
he
putteth
no
trust
in
his
saints
yea
the
heavens
are
not
clean
in
his
sight
15
16
how
much
more
abominable
and
filthy
is
man
which
drinketh
iniquity
like
water
15
17
i
will
shew
thee
hear
me
and
that
which
i
have
seen
i
will
declare
15
18
which
wise
men
have
told
from
their
fathers
and
have
not
hid
it
15
19
unto
whom
alone
the
earth
was
given
and
no
stranger
passed
among
them
15
20
the
wicked
man
travaileth
with
pain
all
his
days
and
the
number
of
years
is
hidden
to
the
oppressor
15
21
a
dreadful
sound
is
in
his
ears
in
prosperity
the
destroyer
shall
come
upon
him
15
22
he
believeth
not
that
he
shall
return
out
of
darkness
and
he
is
waited
for
of
the
sword
15
23
he
wandereth
abroad
for
bread
saying
where
is
it
he
knoweth
that
the
day
of
darkness
is
ready
at
his
hand
15
24
trouble
and
anguish
shall
make
him
afraid
they
shall
prevail
against
him
as
a
king
ready
to
the
battle
15
25
for
he
stretcheth
out
his
hand
against
god
and
strengtheneth
himself
against
the
almighty
15
26
he
runneth
upon
him
even
on
his
neck
upon
the
thick
bosses
of
his
bucklers
15
27
because
he
covereth
his
face
with
his
fatness
and
maketh
collops
of
fat
on
his
flanks
15
28
and
he
dwelleth
in
desolate
cities
and
in
houses
which
no
man
inhabiteth
which
are
ready
to
become
heaps
15
29
he
shall
not
be
rich
neither
shall
his
substance
continue
neither
shall
he
prolong
the
perfection
thereof
upon
the
earth
15
30
he
shall
not
depart
out
of
darkness
the
flame
shall
dry
up
his
branches
and
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
shall
he
go
away
15
31
let
not
him
that
is
deceived
trust
in
vanity
for
vanity
shall
be
his
recompence
15
32
it
shall
be
accomplished
before
his
time
and
his
branch
shall
not
be
green
15
33
he
shall
shake
off
his
unripe
grape
as
the
vine
and
shall
cast
off
his
flower
as
the
olive
15
34
for
the
congregation
of
hypocrites
shall
be
desolate
and
fire
shall
consume
the
tabernacles
of
bribery
15
35
they
conceive
mischief
and
bring
forth
vanity
and
their
belly
prepareth
deceit
16
1
then
job
answered
and
said
16
2
i
have
heard
many
such
things
miserable
comforters
are
ye
all
16
3
shall
vain
words
have
an
end
or
what
emboldeneth
thee
that
thou
answerest
16
4
i
also
could
speak
as
ye
do
if
your
soul
were
in
my
soul’s
stead
i
could
heap
up
words
against
you
and
shake
mine
head
at
you
16
5
but
i
would
strengthen
you
with
my
mouth
and
the
moving
of
my
lips
should
asswage
your
grief
16
6
though
i
speak
my
grief
is
not
asswaged
and
though
i
forbear
what
am
i
eased
16
7
but
now
he
hath
made
me
weary
thou
hast
made
desolate
all
my
company
16
8
and
thou
hast
filled
me
with
wrinkles
which
is
a
witness
against
me
and
my
leanness
rising
up
in
me
beareth
witness
to
my
face
16
9
he
teareth
me
in
his
wrath
who
hateth
me
he
gnasheth
upon
me
with
his
teeth
mine
enemy
sharpeneth
his
eyes
upon
me
16
10
they
have
gaped
upon
me
with
their
mouth
they
have
smitten
me
upon
the
cheek
reproachfully
they
have
gathered
themselves
together
against
me
16
11
god
hath
delivered
me
to
the
ungodly
and
turned
me
over
into
the
hands
of
the
wicked
16
12
i
was
at
ease
but
he
hath
broken
me
asunder
he
hath
also
taken
me
by
my
neck
and
shaken
me
to
pieces
and
set
me
up
for
his
mark
16
13
his
archers
compass
me
round
about
he
cleaveth
my
reins
asunder
and
doth
not
spare
he
poureth
out
my
gall
upon
the
ground
16
14
he
breaketh
me
with
breach
upon
breach
he
runneth
upon
me
like
a
giant
16
15
i
have
sewed
sackcloth
upon
my
skin
and
defiled
my
horn
in
the
dust
16
16
my
face
is
foul
with
weeping
and
on
my
eyelids
is
the
shadow
of
death
16
17
not
for
any
injustice
in
mine
hands
also
my
prayer
is
pure
16
18
o
earth
cover
not
thou
my
blood
and
let
my
cry
have
no
place
16
19
also
now
behold
my
witness
is
in
heaven
and
my
record
is
on
high
16
20
my
friends
scorn
me
but
mine
eye
poureth
out
tears
unto
god
16
21
o
that
one
might
plead
for
a
man
with
god
as
a
man
pleadeth
for
his
neighbour
16
22
when
a
few
years
are
come
then
i
shall
go
the
way
whence
i
shall
not
return
17
1
my
breath
is
corrupt
my
days
are
extinct
the
graves
are
ready
for
me
17
2
are
there
not
mockers
with
me
and
doth
not
mine
eye
continue
in
their
provocation
17
3
lay
down
now
put
me
in
a
surety
with
thee
who
is
he
that
will
strike
hands
with
me
17
4
for
thou
hast
hid
their
heart
from
understanding
therefore
shalt
thou
not
exalt
them
17
5
he
that
speaketh
flattery
to
his
friends
even
the
eyes
of
his
children
shall
fail
17
6
he
hath
made
me
also
a
byword
of
the
people
and
aforetime
i
was
as
a
tabret
17
7
mine
eye
also
is
dim
by
reason
of
sorrow
and
all
my
members
are
as
a
shadow
17
8
upright
men
shall
be
astonied
at
this
and
the
innocent
shall
stir
up
himself
against
the
hypocrite
17
9
the
righteous
also
shall
hold
on
his
way
and
he
that
hath
clean
hands
shall
be
stronger
and
stronger
17
10
but
as
for
you
all
do
ye
return
and
come
now
for
i
cannot
find
one
wise
man
among
you
17
11
my
days
are
past
my
purposes
are
broken
off
even
the
thoughts
of
my
heart
17
12
they
change
the
night
into
day
the
light
is
short
because
of
darkness
17
13
if
i
wait
the
grave
is
mine
house
i
have
made
my
bed
in
the
darkness
17
14
i
have
said
to
corruption
thou
art
my
father
to
the
worm
thou
art
my
mother
and
my
sister
17
15
and
where
is
now
my
hope
as
for
my
hope
who
shall
see
it
17
16
they
shall
go
down
to
the
bars
of
the
pit
when
our
rest
together
is
in
the
dust
18
1
then
answered
bildad
the
shuhite
and
said
18
2
how
long
will
it
be
ere
ye
make
an
end
of
words
mark
and
afterwards
we
will
speak
18
3
wherefore
are
we
counted
as
beasts
and
reputed
vile
in
your
sight
18
4
he
teareth
himself
in
his
anger
shall
the
earth
be
forsaken
for
thee
and
shall
the
rock
be
removed
out
of
his
place
18
5
yea
the
light
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
and
the
spark
of
his
fire
shall
not
shine
18
6
the
light
shall
be
dark
in
his
tabernacle
and
his
candle
shall
be
put
out
with
him
18
7
the
steps
of
his
strength
shall
be
straitened
and
his
own
counsel
shall
cast
him
down
18
8
for
he
is
cast
into
a
net
by
his
own
feet
and
he
walketh
upon
a
snare
18
9
the
gin
shall
take
him
by
the
heel
and
the
robber
shall
prevail
against
him
18
10
the
snare
is
laid
for
him
in
the
ground
and
a
trap
for
him
in
the
way
18
11
terrors
shall
make
him
afraid
on
every
side
and
shall
drive
him
to
his
feet
18
12
his
strength
shall
be
hungerbitten
and
destruction
shall
be
ready
at
his
side
18
13
it
shall
devour
the
strength
of
his
skin
even
the
firstborn
of
death
shall
devour
his
strength
18
14
his
confidence
shall
be
rooted
out
of
his
tabernacle
and
it
shall
bring
him
to
the
king
of
terrors
18
15
it
shall
dwell
in
his
tabernacle
because
it
is
none
of
his
brimstone
shall
be
scattered
upon
his
habitation
18
16
his
roots
shall
be
dried
up
beneath
and
above
shall
his
branch
be
cut
off
18
17
his
remembrance
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
he
shall
have
no
name
in
the
street
18
18
he
shall
be
driven
from
light
into
darkness
and
chased
out
of
the
world
18
19
he
shall
neither
have
son
nor
nephew
among
his
people
nor
any
remaining
in
his
dwellings
18
20
they
that
come
after
him
shall
be
astonied
at
his
day
as
they
that
went
before
were
affrighted
18
21
surely
such
are
the
dwellings
of
the
wicked
and
this
is
the
place
of
him
that
knoweth
not
god
19
1
then
job
answered
and
said
19
2
how
long
will
ye
vex
my
soul
and
break
me
in
pieces
with
words
19
3
these
ten
times
have
ye
reproached
me
ye
are
not
ashamed
that
ye
make
yourselves
strange
to
me
19
4
and
be
it
indeed
that
i
have
erred
mine
error
remaineth
with
myself
19
5
if
indeed
ye
will
magnify
yourselves
against
me
and
plead
against
me
my
reproach
19
6
know
now
that
god
hath
overthrown
me
and
hath
compassed
me
with
his
net
19
7
behold
i
cry
out
of
wrong
but
i
am
not
heard
i
cry
aloud
but
there
is
no
judgment
19
8
he
hath
fenced
up
my
way
that
i
cannot
pass
and
he
hath
set
darkness
in
my
paths
19
9
he
hath
stripped
me
of
my
glory
and
taken
the
crown
from
my
head
19
10
he
hath
destroyed
me
on
every
side
and
i
am
gone
and
mine
hope
hath
he
removed
like
a
tree
19
11
he
hath
also
kindled
his
wrath
against
me
and
he
counteth
me
unto
him
as
one
of
his
enemies
19
12
his
troops
come
together
and
raise
up
their
way
against
me
and
encamp
round
about
my
tabernacle
19
13
he
hath
put
my
brethren
far
from
me
and
mine
acquaintance
are
verily
estranged
from
me
19
14
my
kinsfolk
have
failed
and
my
familiar
friends
have
forgotten
me
19
15
they
that
dwell
in
mine
house
and
my
maids
count
me
for
a
stranger
i
am
an
alien
in
their
sight
19
16
i
called
my
servant
and
he
gave
me
no
answer
i
intreated
him
with
my
mouth
19
17
my
breath
is
strange
to
my
wife
though
i
intreated
for
the
children’s
sake
of
mine
own
body
19
18
yea
young
children
despised
me
i
arose
and
they
spake
against
me
19
19
all
my
inward
friends
abhorred
me
and
they
whom
i
loved
are
turned
against
me
19
20
my
bone
cleaveth
to
my
skin
and
to
my
flesh
and
i
am
escaped
with
the
skin
of
my
teeth
19
21
have
pity
upon
me
have
pity
upon
me
o
ye
my
friends
for
the
hand
of
god
hath
touched
me
19
22
why
do
ye
persecute
me
as
god
and
are
not
satisfied
with
my
flesh
19
23
oh
that
my
words
were
now
written
oh
that
they
were
printed
in
a
book
19
24
that
they
were
graven
with
an
iron
pen
and
lead
in
the
rock
for
ever
19
25
for
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
19
26
and
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
19
27
whom
i
shall
see
for
myself
and
mine
eyes
shall
behold
and
not
another
though
my
reins
be
consumed
within
me
19
28
but
ye
should
say
why
persecute
we
him
seeing
the
root
of
the
matter
is
found
in
me
19
29
be
ye
afraid
of
the
sword
for
wrath
bringeth
the
punishments
of
the
sword
that
ye
may
know
there
is
a
judgment
20
1
then
answered
zophar
the
naamathite
and
said
20
2
therefore
do
my
thoughts
cause
me
to
answer
and
for
this
i
make
haste
20
3
i
have
heard
the
check
of
my
reproach
and
the
spirit
of
my
understanding
causeth
me
to
answer
20
4
knowest
thou
not
this
of
old
since
man
was
placed
upon
earth
20
5
that
the
triumphing
of
the
wicked
is
short
and
the
joy
of
the
hypocrite
but
for
a
moment
20
6
though
his
excellency
mount
up
to
the
heavens
and
his
head
reach
unto
the
clouds
20
7
yet
he
shall
perish
for
ever
like
his
own
dung
they
which
have
seen
him
shall
say
where
is
he
20
8
he
shall
fly
away
as
a
dream
and
shall
not
be
found
yea
he
shall
be
chased
away
as
a
vision
of
the
night
20
9
the
eye
also
which
saw
him
shall
see
him
no
more
neither
shall
his
place
any
more
behold
him
20
10
his
children
shall
seek
to
please
the
poor
and
his
hands
shall
restore
their
goods
20
11
his
bones
are
full
of
the
sin
of
his
youth
which
shall
lie
down
with
him
in
the
dust
20
12
though
wickedness
be
sweet
in
his
mouth
though
he
hide
it
under
his
tongue
20
13
though
he
spare
it
and
forsake
it
not
but
keep
it
still
within
his
mouth
20
14
yet
his
meat
in
his
bowels
is
turned
it
is
the
gall
of
asps
within
him
20
15
he
hath
swallowed
down
riches
and
he
shall
vomit
them
up
again
god
shall
cast
them
out
of
his
belly
20
16
he
shall
suck
the
poison
of
asps
the
viper’s
tongue
shall
slay
him
20
17
he
shall
not
see
the
rivers
the
floods
the
brooks
of
honey
and
butter
20
18
that
which
he
laboured
for
shall
he
restore
and
shall
not
swallow
it
down
according
to
his
substance
shall
the
restitution
be
and
he
shall
not
rejoice
therein
20
19
because
he
hath
oppressed
and
hath
forsaken
the
poor
because
he
hath
violently
taken
away
an
house
which
he
builded
not
20
20
surely
he
shall
not
feel
quietness
in
his
belly
he
shall
not
save
of
that
which
he
desired
20
21
there
shall
none
of
his
meat
be
left
therefore
shall
no
man
look
for
his
goods
20
22
in
the
fulness
of
his
sufficiency
he
shall
be
in
straits
every
hand
of
the
wicked
shall
come
upon
him
20
23
when
he
is
about
to
fill
his
belly
god
shall
cast
the
fury
of
his
wrath
upon
him
and
shall
rain
it
upon
him
while
he
is
eating
20
24
he
shall
flee
from
the
iron
weapon
and
the
bow
of
steel
shall
strike
him
through
20
25
it
is
drawn
and
cometh
out
of
the
body
yea
the
glittering
sword
cometh
out
of
his
gall
terrors
are
upon
him
20
26
all
darkness
shall
be
hid
in
his
secret
places
a
fire
not
blown
shall
consume
him
it
shall
go
ill
with
him
that
is
left
in
his
tabernacle
20
27
the
heaven
shall
reveal
his
iniquity
and
the
earth
shall
rise
up
against
him
20
28
the
increase
of
his
house
shall
depart
and
his
goods
shall
flow
away
in
the
day
of
his
wrath
20
29
this
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
from
god
and
the
heritage
appointed
unto
him
by
god
21

but
job
answered
and
said
21
2
hear
diligently
my
speech
and
let
this
be
your
consolations
21
3
suffer
me
that
i
may
speak
and
after
that
i
have
spoken
mock
on
21
4
as
for
me
is
my
complaint
to
man
and
if
it
were
so
why
should
not
my
spirit
be
troubled
21
5
mark
me
and
be
astonished
and
lay
your
hand
upon
your
mouth
21
6
even
when
i
remember
i
am
afraid
and
trembling
taketh
hold
on
my
flesh
21
7
wherefore
do
the
wicked
live
become
old
yea
are
mighty
in
power
21
8
their
seed
is
established
in
their
sight
with
them
and
their
offspring
before
their
eyes
21
9
their
houses
are
safe
from
fear
neither
is
the
rod
of
god
upon
them
21
10
their
bull
gendereth
and
faileth
not
their
cow
calveth
and
casteth
not
her
calf
21
11
they
send
forth
their
little
ones
like
a
flock
and
their
children
dance
21
12
they
take
the
timbrel
and
harp
and
rejoice
at
the
sound
of
the
organ
21
13
they
spend
their
days
in
wealth
and
in
a
moment
go
down
to
the
grave
21
14
therefore
they
say
unto
god
depart
from
us
for
we
desire
not
the
knowledge
of
thy
ways
21
15
what
is
the
almighty
that
we
should
serve
him
and
what
profit
should
we
have
if
we
pray
unto
him
21
16
lo
their
good
is
not
in
their
hand
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me
21
17
how
oft
is
the
candle
of
the
wicked
put
out
and
how
oft
cometh
their
destruction
upon
them
god
distributeth
sorrows
in
his
anger
21
18
they
are
as
stubble
before
the
wind
and
as
chaff
that
the
storm
carrieth
away
21
19
god
layeth
up
his
iniquity
for
his
children
he
rewardeth
him
and
he
shall
know
it
21
20
his
eyes
shall
see
his
destruction
and
he
shall
drink
of
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
21
21
for
what
pleasure
hath
he
in
his
house
after
him
when
the
number
of
his
months
is
cut
off
in
the
midst
21
22
shall
any
teach
god
knowledge
seeing
he
judgeth
those
that
are
high
21
23
one
dieth
in
his
full
strength
being
wholly
at
ease
and
quiet
21
24
his
breasts
are
full
of
milk
and
his
bones
are
moistened
with
marrow
21
25
and
another
dieth
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
and
never
eateth
with
pleasure
21
26
they
shall
lie
down
alike
in
the
dust
and
the
worms
shall
cover
them
21
27
behold
i
know
your
thoughts
and
the
devices
which
ye
wrongfully
imagine
against
me
21
28
for
ye
say
where
is
the
house
of
the
prince
and
where
are
the
dwelling
places
of
the
wicked
21
29
have
ye
not
asked
them
that
go
by
the
way
and
do
ye
not
know
their
tokens
21
30
that
the
wicked
is
reserved
to
the
day
of
destruction
they
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
day
of
wrath
21
31
who
shall
declare
his
way
to
his
face
and
who
shall
repay
him
what
he
hath
done
21
32
yet
shall
he
be
brought
to
the
grave
and
shall
remain
in
the
tomb
21
33
the
clods
of
the
valley
shall
be
sweet
unto
him
and
every
man
shall
draw
after
him
as
there
are
innumerable
before
him
21
34
how
then
comfort
ye
me
in
vain
seeing
in
your
answers
there
remaineth
falsehood
22
1
then
eliphaz
the
temanite
answered
and
said
22
2
can
a
man
be
profitable
unto
god
as
he
that
is
wise
may
be
profitable
unto
himself
22
3
is
it
any
pleasure
to
the
almighty
that
thou
art
righteous
or
is
it
gain
to
him
that
thou
makest
thy
ways
perfect
22
4
will
he
reprove
thee
for
fear
of
thee
will
he
enter
with
thee
into
judgment
22
5
is
not
thy
wickedness
great
and
thine
iniquities
infinite
22
6
for
thou
hast
taken
a
pledge
from
thy
brother
for
nought
and
stripped
the
naked
of
their
clothing
22
7
thou
hast
not
given
water
to
the
weary
to
drink
and
thou
hast
withholden
bread
from
the
hungry
22
8
but
as
for
the
mighty
man
he
had
the
earth
and
the
honourable
man
dwelt
in
it
22
9
thou
hast
sent
widows
away
empty
and
the
arms
of
the
fatherless
have
been
broken
22
10
therefore
snares
are
round
about
thee
and
sudden
fear
troubleth
thee
22
11
or
darkness
that
thou
canst
not
see
and
abundance
of
waters
cover
thee
22
12
is
not
god
in
the
height
of
heaven
and
behold
the
height
of
the
stars
how
high
they
are
22
13
and
thou
sayest
how
doth
god
know
can
he
judge
through
the
dark
cloud
22
14
thick
clouds
are
a
covering
to
him
that
he
seeth
not
and
he
walketh
in
the
circuit
of
heaven
22
15
hast
thou
marked
the
old
way
which
wicked
men
have
trodden
22
16
which
were
cut
down
out
of
time
whose
foundation
was
overflown
with
a
flood
22
17
which
said
unto
god
depart
from
us
and
what
can
the
almighty
do
for
them
22
18
yet
he
filled
their
houses
with
good
things
but
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me
22
19
the
righteous
see
it
and
are
glad
and
the
innocent
laugh
them
to
scorn
22
20
whereas
our
substance
is
not
cut
down
but
the
remnant
of
them
the
fire
consumeth
22
21
acquaint
now
thyself
with
him
and
be
at
peace
thereby
good
shall
come
unto
thee
22
22
receive
i
pray
thee
the
law
from
his
mouth
and
lay
up
his
words
in
thine
heart
22
23
if
thou
return
to
the
almighty
thou
shalt
be
built
up
thou
shalt
put
away
iniquity
far
from
thy
tabernacles
22
24
then
shalt
thou
lay
up
gold
as
dust
and
the
gold
of
ophir
as
the
stones
of
the
brooks
22
25
yea
the
almighty
shall
be
thy
defence
and
thou
shalt
have
plenty
of
silver
22
26
for
then
shalt
thou
have
thy
delight
in
the
almighty
and
shalt
lift
up
thy
face
unto
god
22
27
thou
shalt
make
thy
prayer
unto
him
and
he
shall
hear
thee
and
thou
shalt
pay
thy
vows
22
28
thou
shalt
also
decree
a
thing
and
it
shall
be
established
unto
thee
and
the
light
shall
shine
upon
thy
ways
22
29
when
men
are
cast
down
then
thou
shalt
say
there
is
lifting
up
and
he
shall
save
the
humble
person
22
30
he
shall
deliver
the
island
of
the
innocent
and
it
is
delivered
by
the
pureness
of
thine
hands
23
1
then
job
answered
and
said
23
2
even
to
day
is
my
complaint
bitter
my
stroke
is
heavier
than
my
groaning
23
3
oh
that
i
knew
where
i
might
find
him
that
i
might
come
even
to
his
seat
23
4
i
would
order
my
cause
before
him
and
fill
my
mouth
with
arguments
23
5
i
would
know
the
words
which
he
would
answer
me
and
understand
what
he
would
say
unto
me
23
6
will
he
plead
against
me
with
his
great
power
no
but
he
would
put
strength
in
me
23
7
there
the
righteous
might
dispute
with
him
so
should
i
be
delivered
for
ever
from
my
judge
23
8
behold
i
go
forward
but
he
is
not
there
and
backward
but
i
cannot
perceive
him
23
9
on
the
left
hand
where
he
doth
work
but
i
cannot
behold
him
he
hideth
himself
on
the
right
hand
that
i
cannot
see
him
23
10
but
he
knoweth
the
way
that
i
take
when
he
hath
tried
me
i
shall
come
forth
as
gold
23
11
my
foot
hath
held
his
steps
his
way
have
i
kept
and
not
declined
23
12
neither
have
i
gone
back
from
the
commandment
of
his
lips
i
have
esteemed
the
words
of
his
mouth
more
than
my
necessary
food
23
13
but
he
is
in
one
mind
and
who
can
turn
him
and
what
his
soul
desireth
even
that
he
doeth
23
14
for
he
performeth
the
thing
that
is
appointed
for
me
and
many
such
things
are
with
him
23
15
therefore
am
i
troubled
at
his
presence
when
i
consider
i
am
afraid
of
him
23
16
for
god
maketh
my
heart
soft
and
the
almighty
troubleth
me
23
17
because
i
was
not
cut
off
before
the
darkness
neither
hath
he
covered
the
darkness
from
my
face
24
1
why
seeing
times
are
not
hidden
from
the
almighty
do
they
that
know
him
not
see
his
days
24
2
some
remove
the
landmarks
they
violently
take
away
flocks
and
feed
thereof
24
3
they
drive
away
the
ass
of
the
fatherless
they
take
the
widow’s
ox
for
a
pledge
24
4
they
turn
the
needy
out
of
the
way
the
poor
of
the
earth
hide
themselves
together
24
5
behold
as
wild
asses
in
the
desert
go
they
forth
to
their
work
rising
betimes
for
a
prey
the
wilderness
yieldeth
food
for
them
and
for
their
children
24
6
they
reap
every
one
his
corn
in
the
field
and
they
gather
the
vintage
of
the
wicked
24
7
they
cause
the
naked
to
lodge
without
clothing
that
they
have
no
covering
in
the
cold
24
8
they
are
wet
with
the
showers
of
the
mountains
and
embrace
the
rock
for
want
of
a
shelter
24
9
they
pluck
the
fatherless
from
the
breast
and
take
a
pledge
of
the
poor
24
10
they
cause
him
to
go
naked
without
clothing
and
they
take
away
the
sheaf
from
the
hungry
24
11
which
make
oil
within
their
walls
and
tread
their
winepresses
and
suffer
thirst
24
12
men
groan
from
out
of
the
city
and
the
soul
of
the
wounded
crieth
out
yet
god
layeth
not
folly
to
them
24
13
they
are
of
those
that
rebel
against
the
light
they
know
not
the
ways
thereof
nor
abide
in
the
paths
thereof
24
14
the
murderer
rising
with
the
light
killeth
the
poor
and
needy
and
in
the
night
is
as
a
thief
24
15
the
eye
also
of
the
adulterer
waiteth
for
the
twilight
saying
no
eye
shall
see
me
and
disguiseth
his
face
24
16
in
the
dark
they
dig
through
houses
which
they
had
marked
for
themselves
in
the
daytime
they
know
not
the
light
24
17
for
the
morning
is
to
them
even
as
the
shadow
of
death
if
one
know
them
they
are
in
the
terrors
of
the
shadow
of
death
24
18
he
is
swift
as
the
waters
their
portion
is
cursed
in
the
earth
he
beholdeth
not
the
way
of
the
vineyards
24
19
drought
and
heat
consume
the
snow
waters
so
doth
the
grave
those
which
have
sinned
24
20
the
womb
shall
forget
him
the
worm
shall
feed
sweetly
on
him
he
shall
be
no
more
remembered
and
wickedness
shall
be
broken
as
a
tree
24
21
he
evil
entreateth
the
barren
that
beareth
not
and
doeth
not
good
to
the
widow
24
22
he
draweth
also
the
mighty
with
his
power
he
riseth
up
and
no
man
is
sure
of
life
24
23
though
it
be
given
him
to
be
in
safety
whereon
he
resteth
yet
his
eyes
are
upon
their
ways
24
24
they
are
exalted
for
a
little
while
but
are
gone
and
brought
low
they
are
taken
out
of
the
way
as
all
other
and
cut
off
as
the
tops
of
the
ears
of
corn
24
25
and
if
it
be
not
so
now
who
will
make
me
a
liar
and
make
my
speech
nothing
worth
25

then
answered
bildad
the

said
25

dominion
and
fear
are
with
him
he
maketh
peace
in
his
high
places
25
3
is
there
any
number
of
his
armies
and
upon
whom
doth
not
his
light
arise
25
4
how
then
can
man
be
justified
with
god
or
how
can
he
be
clean
that
is
born
of
a
woman
25
5
behold
even
to
the
moon
and
it
shineth
not
yea
the
stars
are
not
pure
in
his
sight
25
6
how
much
less
man
that

a
worm
and
the

of

a
worm
26

but
job
answered

said
26

how
hast
thou
helped
him
that
is
without
power
how
savest
thou
the
arm
that
hath
no
strength
26
3
how
hast
thou
counselled
him
that
hath
no
wisdom
and
how
hast
thou
plentifully
declared
the
thing
as
it
is
26
4
to
whom
hast
thou
uttered
words
and
whose
spirit
came
from

dead
things
are
formed
from
under
the
waters
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
26
6
hell
is
naked
before
him
and
destruction
hath
no
covering
26
7
he
stretcheth
out
the
north
over
the
empty
place
and
hangeth
the
earth
upon
nothing
26
8
he
bindeth
up
the
waters
in
his
thick
clouds
and
the
cloud
is
not
rent
under
them
26
9
he
holdeth
back
the
face
of
his
throne
and
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon
it
26
10
he
hath
compassed
the
waters
with
bounds
until
the
day
and
night
come
to
an
end
26
11
the
pillars
of
heaven
tremble
and
are
astonished
at
his
reproof
26
12
he
divideth
the
sea
with
his
power
and
by
his
understanding
he
smiteth
through
the
proud
26
13
by
his
spirit
he
hath
garnished
the
heavens
his
hand
hath
formed
the
crooked
serpent
26
14
lo
these
are
parts
of
his
ways
but
how
little
a
portion
is
heard
of
him
but
the
thunder
of
his
power
who
can
understand
27
1
moreover
job
continued
his
parable
and
said
27
2
as
god
liveth
who
hath
taken
away
my
judgment
and
the
almighty
who
hath
vexed
my
soul
27
3
all
the
while
my
breath
is
in
me
and
the
spirit
of
god
is
in
my
nostrils
27
4
my
lips
shall
not
speak
wickedness
nor
my
tongue
utter
deceit
27
5
god
forbid
that
i
should
justify
you
till
i
die
i
will
not
remove
mine
integrity
from
me
27
6
my
righteousness
i
hold
fast
and
will
not
let
it
go
my
heart
shall
not
reproach
me
so
long
as
i
live
27
7
let
mine
enemy
be
as
the
wicked
and
he
that
riseth
up
against
me
as
the
unrighteous
27
8
for
what
is
the
hope
of
the
hypocrite
though
he
hath
gained
when
god
taketh
away
his
soul
27
9
will
god
hear
his
cry
when
trouble
cometh
upon
him
27
10
will
he
delight
himself
in
the
almighty
will
he
always
call
upon
god
27
11
i
will
teach
you
by
the
hand
of
god
that
which
is
with
the
almighty
will
i
not
conceal
27
12
behold
all
ye
yourselves
have
seen
it
why
then
are
ye
thus
altogether
vain
27
13
this
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
with
god
and
the
heritage
of
oppressors
which
they
shall
receive
of
the
almighty
27
14
if
his
children
be
multiplied
it
is
for
the
sword
and
his
offspring
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
bread
27
15
those
that
remain
of
him
shall
be
buried
in
death
and
his
widows
shall
not
weep
27
16
though
he
heap
up
silver
as
the
dust
and
prepare
raiment
as
the
clay
27
17
he
may
prepare
it
but
the
just
shall
put
it
on
and
the
innocent
shall
divide
the
silver
27
18
he
buildeth
his
house
as
a
moth
and
as
a
booth
that
the
keeper
maketh
27
19
the
rich
man
shall
lie
down
but
he
shall
not
be
gathered
he
openeth
his
eyes
and
he
is
not
27
20
terrors
take
hold
on
him
as
waters
a
tempest
stealeth
him
away
in
the
night
27
21
the
east
wind
carrieth
him
away
and
he
departeth
and
as
a
storm
hurleth
him
out
of
his
place
27
22
for
god
shall
cast
upon
him
and
not
spare
he
would
fain
flee
out
of
his
hand
27
23
men
shall
clap
their
hands
at
him
and
shall
hiss
him
out
of
his
place
28
1
surely
there
is
a
vein
for
the
silver
and
a
place
for
gold
where
they
fine
it
28
2
iron
is
taken
out
of
the
earth
and
brass
is
molten
out
of
the
stone
28
3
he
setteth
an
end
to
darkness
and
searcheth
out
all
perfection
the
stones
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
28
4
the
flood
breaketh
out
from
the
inhabitant
even
the
waters
forgotten
of
the
foot
they
are
dried
up
they
are
gone
away
from
men
28
5
as
for
the
earth
out
of
it
cometh
bread
and
under
it
is
turned
up
as
it
were
fire
28
6
the
stones
of
it
are
the
place
of
sapphires
and
it
hath
dust
of
gold
28
7
there
is
a
path
which
no
fowl
knoweth
and
which
the
vulture’s
eye
hath
not
seen
28
8
the
lion’s
whelps
have
not
trodden
it
nor
the
fierce
lion
passed
by
it
28
9
he
putteth
forth
his
hand
upon
the
rock
he
overturneth
the
mountains
by
the
roots
28
10
he
cutteth
out
rivers
among
the
rocks
and
his
eye
seeth
every
precious
thing
28
11
he
bindeth
the
floods
from
overflowing
and
the
thing
that
is
hid
bringeth
he
forth
to
light
28
12
but
where
shall
wisdom
be
found
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
28
13
man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof
neither
is
it
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
28
14
the
depth
saith
it
is
not
in
me
and
the
sea
saith
it
is
not
with
me
28
15
it
cannot
be
gotten
for
gold
neither
shall
silver
be
weighed
for
the
price
thereof
28
16
it
cannot
be
valued
with
the
gold
of
ophir
with
the
precious
onyx
or
the
sapphire
28
17
the
gold
and
the
crystal
cannot
equal
it
and
the
exchange
of
it
shall
not
be
for
jewels
of
fine
gold
28
18
no
mention
shall
be
made
of
coral
or
of
pearls
for
the
price
of
wisdom
is
above
rubies
28
19
the
topaz
of
ethiopia
shall
not
equal
it
neither
shall
it
be
valued
with
pure
gold
28
20
whence
then
cometh
wisdom
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
28
21
seeing
it
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
living
and
kept
close
from
the
fowls
of
the
air
28
22
destruction
and
death
say
we
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
with
our
ears
28
23
god
understandeth
the
way
thereof
and
he
knoweth
the
place
thereof
28
24
for
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven
28
25
to
make
the
weight
for
the
winds
and
he
weigheth
the
waters
by
measure
28
26
when
he
made
a
decree
for
the
rain
and
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
the
thunder
28
27
then
did
he
see
it
and
declare
it
he
prepared
it
yea
and
searched
it
out
28
28
and
unto
man
he
said
behold
the
fear
of
the
lord
that
is
wisdom
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding
29
1
moreover
job
continued
his
parable
and
said
29
2
oh
that
i
were
as
in
months
past
as
in
the
days
when
god
preserved
me
29
3
when
his
candle
shined
upon
my
head
and
when
by
his
light
i
walked
through
darkness
29
4
as
i
was
in
the
days
of
my
youth
when
the
secret
of
god
was
upon
my
tabernacle
29
5
when
the
almighty
was
yet
with
me
when
my
children
were
about
me
29
6
when
i
washed
my
steps
with
butter
and
the
rock
poured
me
out
rivers
of
oil
29
7
when
i
went
out
to
the
gate
through
the
city
when
i
prepared
my
seat
in
the
street
29
8
the
young
men
saw
me
and
hid
themselves
and
the
aged
arose
and
stood
up
29
9
the
princes
refrained
talking
and
laid
their
hand
on
their
mouth
29
10
the
nobles
held
their
peace
and
their
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
their
mouth
29
11
when
the
ear
heard
me
then
it
blessed
me
and
when
the
eye
saw
me
it
gave
witness
to
me
29
12
because
i
delivered
the
poor
that
cried
and
the
fatherless
and
him
that
had
none
to
help
him
29
13
the
blessing
of
him
that
was
ready
to
perish
came
upon
me
and
i
caused
the
widow’s
heart
to
sing
for
joy
29
14
i
put
on
righteousness
and
it
clothed
me
my
judgment
was
as
a
robe
and
a
diadem
29
15
i
was
eyes
to
the
blind
and
feet
was
i
to
the
lame
29
16
i
was
a
father
to
the
poor
and
the
cause
which
i
knew
not
i
searched
out
29
17
and
i
brake
the
jaws
of
the
wicked
and
plucked
the
spoil
out
of
his
teeth
29
18
then
i
said
i
shall
die
in
my
nest
and
i
shall
multiply
my
days
as
the
sand
29
19
my
root
was
spread
out
by
the
waters
and
the
dew
lay
all
night
upon
my
branch
29
20
my
glory
was
fresh
in
me
and
my
bow
was
renewed
in
my
hand
29
21
unto
me
men
gave
ear
and
waited
and
kept
silence
at
my
counsel
29
22
after
my
words
they
spake
not
again
and
my
speech
dropped
upon
them
29
23
and
they
waited
for
me
as
for
the
rain
and
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
as
for
the
latter
rain
29
24
if
i
laughed
on
them
they
believed
it
not
and
the
light
of
my
countenance
they
cast
not
down
29
25
i
chose
out
their
way
and
sat
chief
and
dwelt
as
a
king
in
the
army
as
one
that
comforteth
the
mourners
30
1
but
now
they
that
are
younger
than
i
have
me
in
derision
whose
fathers
i
would
have
disdained
to
have
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
flock
30
2
yea
whereto
might
the
strength
of
their
hands
profit
me
in
whom
old
age
was
perished
30
3
for
want
and
famine
they
were
solitary
fleeing
into
the
wilderness
in
former
time
desolate
and
waste
30
4
who
cut
up
mallows
by
the
bushes
and
juniper
roots
for
their
meat
30
5
they
were
driven
forth
from
among
men
(they
cried
after
them
as
after
a
thief
)
30
6
to
dwell
in
the
cliffs
of
the
valleys
in
caves
of
the
earth
and
in
the
rocks
30
7
among
the
bushes
they
brayed
under
the
nettles
they
were
gathered
together
30
8
they
were
children
of
fools
yea
children
of
base
men
they
were
viler
than
the
earth
30
9
and
now
am
i
their
song
yea
i
am
their
byword
30
10
they
abhor
me
they
flee
far
from
me
and
spare
not
to
spit
in
my
face
30
11
because
he
hath
loosed
my
cord
and
afflicted
me
they
have
also
let
loose
the
bridle
before
me
30
12
upon
my
right
hand
rise
the
youth
they
push
away
my
feet
and
they
raise
up
against
me
the
ways
of
their
destruction
30
13
they
mar
my
path
they
set
forward
my
calamity
they
have
no
helper
30
14
they
came
upon
me
as
a
wide
breaking
in
of
waters
in
the
desolation
they
rolled
themselves
upon
me
30
15
terrors
are
turned
upon
me
they
pursue
my
soul
as
the
wind
and
my
welfare
passeth
away
as
a
cloud
30
16
and
now
my
soul
is
poured
out
upon
me
the
days
of
affliction
have
taken
hold
upon
me
30
17
my
bones
are
pierced
in
me
in
the
night
season
and
my
sinews
take
no
rest
30
18
by
the
great
force
of
my
disease
is
my
garment
changed
it
bindeth
me
about
as
the
collar
of
my
coat
30
19
he
hath
cast
me
into
the
mire
and
i
am
become
like
dust
and
ashes
30
20
i
cry
unto
thee
and
thou
dost
not
hear
me
i
stand
up
and
thou
regardest
me
not
30
21
thou
art
become
cruel
to
me
with
thy
strong
hand
thou
opposest
thyself
against
me
30
22
thou
liftest
me
up
to
the
wind
thou
causest
me
to
ride
upon
it
and
dissolvest
my
substance
30
23
for
i
know
that
thou
wilt
bring
me
to
death
and
to
the
house
appointed
for
all
living
30
24
howbeit
he
will
not
stretch
out
his
hand
to
the
grave
though
they
cry
in
his
destruction
30
25
did
not
i
weep
for
him
that
was
in
trouble
was
not
my
soul
grieved
for
the
poor
30
26
when
i
looked
for
good
then
evil
came
unto
me
and
when
i
waited
for
light
there
came
darkness
30
27
my
bowels
boiled
and
rested
not
the
days
of
affliction
prevented
me
30
28
i
went
mourning
without
the
sun
i
stood
up
and
i
cried
in
the
congregation
30
29
i
am
a
brother
to
dragons
and
a
companion
to
owls
30
30
my
skin
is
black
upon
me
and
my
bones
are
burned
with
heat
30
31
my
harp
also
is
turned
to
mourning
and
my
organ
into
the
voice
of
them
that
weep
31
1
i
made
a
covenant
with
mine
eyes
why
then
should
i
think
upon
a
maid
31
2
for
what
portion
of
god
is
there
from
above
and
what
inheritance
of
the
almighty
from
on
high
31
3
is
not
destruction
to
the
wicked
and
a
strange
punishment
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
31
4
doth
not
he
see
my
ways
and
count
all
my
steps
31
5
if
i
have
walked
with
vanity
or
if
my
foot
hath
hasted
to
deceit
31
6
let
me
be
weighed
in
an
even
balance
that
god
may
know
mine
integrity
31
7
if
my
step
hath
turned
out
of
the
way
and
mine
heart
walked
after
mine
eyes
and
if
any
blot
hath
cleaved
to
mine
hands
31
8
then
let
me
sow
and
let
another
eat
yea
let
my
offspring
be
rooted
out
31
9
if
mine
heart
have
been
deceived
by
a
woman
or
if
i
have
laid
wait
at
my
neighbour’s
door
31
10
then
let
my
wife
grind
unto
another
and
let
others
bow
down
upon
her
31
11
for
this
is
an
heinous
crime
yea
it
is
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judges
31
12
for
it
is
a
fire
that
consumeth
to
destruction
and
would
root
out
all
mine
increase
31
13
if
i
did
despise
the
cause
of
my
manservant
or
of
my
maidservant
when
they
contended
with
me
31
14
what
then
shall
i
do
when
god
riseth
up
and
when
he
visiteth
what
shall
i
answer
him
31
15
did
not
he
that
made
me
in
the
womb
make
him
and
did
not
one
fashion
us
in
the
womb
31
16
if
i
have
withheld
the
poor
from
their
desire
or
have
caused
the
eyes
of
the
widow
to
fail
31
17
or
have
eaten
my
morsel
myself
alone
and
the
fatherless
hath
not
eaten
thereof
31
18
(for
from
my
youth
he
was
brought
up
with
me
as
with
a
father
and
i
have
guided
her
from
my
mother’s
womb
)
31
19
if
i
have
seen
any
perish
for
want
of
clothing
or
any
poor
without
covering
31
20
if
his
loins
have
not
blessed
me
and
if
he
were
not
warmed
with
the
fleece
of
my
sheep
31
21
if
i
have
lifted
up
my
hand
against
the
fatherless
when
i
saw
my
help
in
the
gate
31
22
then
let
mine
arm
fall
from
my
shoulder
blade
and
mine
arm
be
broken
from
the
bone
31
23
for
destruction
from
god
was
a
terror
to
me
and
by
reason
of
his
highness
i
could
not
endure
31
24
if
i
have
made
gold
my
hope
or
have
said
to
the
fine
gold
thou
art
my
confidence
31
25
if
i
rejoice
because
my
wealth
was
great
and
because
mine
hand
had
gotten
much
31
26
if
i
beheld
the
sun
when
it
shined
or
the
moon
walking
in
brightness
31
27
and
my
heart
hath
been
secretly
enticed
or
my
mouth
hath
kissed
my
hand
31
28
this
also
were
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judge
for
i
should
have
denied
the
god
that
is
above
31
29
if
i
rejoice
at
the
destruction
of
him
that
hated
me
or
lifted
up
myself
when
evil
found
him
31
30
neither
have
i
suffered
my
mouth
to
sin
by
wishing
a
curse
to
his
soul
31
31
if
the
men
of
my
tabernacle
said
not
oh
that
we
had
of
his
flesh
we
cannot
be
satisfied
31
32
the
stranger
did
not
lodge
in
the
street
but
i
opened
my
doors
to
the
traveller
31
33
if
i
covered
my
transgressions
as
adam
by
hiding
mine
iniquity
in
my
bosom
31
34
did
i
fear
a
great
multitude
or
did
the
contempt
of
families
terrify
me
that
i
kept
silence
and
went
not
out
of
the
door
31
35
oh
that
one
would
hear
me
behold
my
desire
is
that
the
almighty
would
answer
me
and
that
mine
adversary
had
written
a
book
31
36
surely
i
would
take
it
upon
my
shoulder
and
bind
it
as
a
crown
to
me
31
37
i
would
declare
unto
him
the
number
of
my
steps
as
a
prince
would
i
go
near
unto
him
31
38
if
my
land
cry
against
me
or
that
the
furrows
likewise
thereof
complain
31
39
if
i
have
eaten
the
fruits
thereof
without
money
or
have
caused
the
owners
thereof
to
lose
their
life
31
40
let
thistles
grow
instead
of
wheat
and
cockle
instead
of
barley
the
words
of
job
are
ended
32
1
so
these
three
men
ceased
to
answer
job
because
he
was
righteous
in
his
own
eyes
32
2
then
was
kindled
the
wrath
of
elihu
the
son
of
barachel
the
buzite
of
the
kindred
of
ram
against
job
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
he
justified
himself
rather
than
god
32
3
also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
they
had
found
no
answer
and
yet
had
condemned
job
32
4
now
elihu
had
waited
till
job
had
spoken
because
they
were
elder
than
he
32
5
when
elihu
saw
that
there
was
no
answer
in
the
mouth
of
these
three
men
then
his
wrath
was
kindled
32
6
and
elihu
the
son
of
barachel
the
buzite
answered
and
said
i
am
young
and
ye
are
very
old
wherefore
i
was
afraid
and
durst
not
shew
you
mine
opinion
32
7
i
said
days
should
speak
and
multitude
of
years
should
teach
wisdom
32
8
but
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
and
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
giveth
them
understanding
32
9
great
men
are
not
always
wise
neither
do
the
aged
understand
judgment
32
10
therefore
i
said
hearken
to
me
i
also
will
shew
mine
opinion
32
11
behold
i
waited
for
your
words
i
gave
ear
to
your
reasons
whilst
ye
searched
out
what
to
say
32
12
yea
i
attended
unto
you
and
behold
there
was
none
of
you
that
convinced
job
or
that
answered
his
words
32
13
lest
ye
should
say
we
have
found
out
wisdom
god
thrusteth
him
down
not
man
32
14
now
he
hath
not
directed
his
words
against
me
neither
will
i
answer
him
with
your
speeches
32
15
they
were
amazed
they
answered
no
more
they
left
off
speaking
32
16
when
i
had
waited
(for
they
spake
not
but
stood
still
and
answered
no
more
)
32
17
i
said
i
will
answer
also
my
part
i
also
will
shew
mine
opinion
32
18
for
i
am
full
of
matter
the
spirit
within
me
constraineth
me
32
19
behold
my
belly
is
as
wine
which
hath
no
vent
it
is
ready
to
burst
like
new
bottles
32
20
i
will
speak
that
i
may
be
refreshed
i
will
open
my
lips
and
answer
32
21
let
me
not
i
pray
you
accept
any
man’s
person
neither
let
me
give
flattering
titles
unto
man
32
22
for
i
know
not
to
give
flattering
titles
in
so
doing
my
maker
would
soon
take
me
away
33
1
wherefore
job
i
pray
thee
hear
my
speeches
and
hearken
to
all
my
words
33
2
behold
now
i
have
opened
my
mouth
my
tongue
hath
spoken
in
my
mouth
33
3
my
words
shall
be
of
the
uprightness
of
my
heart
and
my
lips
shall
utter
knowledge
clearly
33
4
the
spirit
of
god
hath
made
me
and
the
breath
of
the
almighty
hath
given
me
life
33
5
if
thou
canst
answer
me
set
thy
words
in
order
before
me
stand
up
33
6
behold
i
am
according
to
thy
wish
in
god’s
stead
i
also
am
formed
out
of
the
clay
33
7
behold
my
terror
shall
not
make
thee
afraid
neither
shall
my
hand
be
heavy
upon
thee
33
8
surely
thou
hast
spoken
in
mine
hearing
and
i
have
heard
the
voice
of
thy
words
saying
33
9
i
am
clean
without
transgression
i
am
innocent
neither
is
there
iniquity
in
me
33
10
behold
he
findeth
occasions
against
me
he
counteth
me
for
his
enemy
33
11
he
putteth
my
feet
in
the
stocks
he
marketh
all
my
paths
33
12
behold
in
this
thou
art
not
just
i
will
answer
thee
that
god
is
greater
than
man
33
13
why
dost
thou
strive
against
him
for
he
giveth
not
account
of
any
of
his
matters
33
14
for
god
speaketh
once
yea
twice
yet
man
perceiveth
it
not
33
15
in
a
dream
in
a
vision
of
the
night
when
deep
sleep
falleth
upon
men
in
slumberings
upon
the
bed
33
16
then
he
openeth
the
ears
of
men
and
sealeth
their
instruction
33
17
that
he
may
withdraw
man
from
his
purpose
and
hide
pride
from
man
33
18
he
keepeth
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
and
his
life
from
perishing
by
the
sword
33
19
he
is
chastened
also
with
pain
upon
his
bed
and
the
multitude
of
his
bones
with
strong
pain
33
20
so
that
his
life
abhorreth
bread
and
his
soul
dainty
meat
33
21
his
flesh
is
consumed
away
that
it
cannot
be
seen
and
his
bones
that
were
not
seen
stick
out
33
22
yea
his
soul
draweth
near
unto
the
grave
and
his
life
to
the
destroyers
33
23
if
there
be
a
messenger
with
him
an
interpreter
one
among
a
thousand
to
shew
unto
man
his
uprightness
33
24
then
he
is
gracious
unto
him
and
saith
deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
pit
i
have
found
a
ransom
33
25
his
flesh
shall
be
fresher
than
a
child’s
he
shall
return
to
the
days
of
his
youth
33
26
he
shall
pray
unto
god
and
he
will
be
favourable
unto
him
and
he
shall
see
his
face
with
joy
for
he
will
render
unto
man
his
righteousness
33
27
he
looketh
upon
men
and
if
any
say
i
have
sinned
and
perverted
that
which
was
right
and
it
profited
me
not
33
28
he
will
deliver
his
soul
from
going
into
the
pit
and
his
life
shall
see
the
light
33
29
lo
all
these
things
worketh
god
oftentimes
with
man
33
30
to
bring
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
to
be
enlightened
with
the
light
of
the
living
33
31
mark
well
o
job
hearken
unto
me
hold
thy
peace
and
i
will
speak
33
32
if
thou
hast
anything
to
say
answer
me
speak
for
i
desire
to
justify
thee
33
33
if
not
hearken
unto
me
hold
thy
peace
and
i
shall
teach
thee
wisdom
34
1
furthermore
elihu
answered
and
said
34
2
hear
my
words
o
ye
wise
men
and
give
ear
unto
me
ye
that
have
knowledge
34
3
for
the
ear
trieth
words
as
the
mouth
tasteth
meat
34
4
let
us
choose
to
us
judgment
let
us
know
among
ourselves
what
is
good
34
5
for
job
hath
said
i
am
righteous
and
god
hath
taken
away
my
judgment
34
6
should
i
lie
against
my
right
my
wound
is
incurable
without
transgression
34
7
what
man
is
like
job
who
drinketh
up
scorning
like
water
34
8
which
goeth
in
company
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
and
walketh
with
wicked
men
34
9
for
he
hath
said
it
profiteth
a
man
nothing
that
he
should
delight
himself
with
god
34
10
therefore
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
understanding
far
be
it
from
god
that
he
should
do
wickedness
and
from
the
almighty
that
he
should
commit
iniquity
34
11
for
the
work
of
a
man
shall
he
render
unto
him
and
cause
every
man
to
find
according
to
his
ways
34
12
yea
surely
god
will
not
do
wickedly
neither
will
the
almighty
pervert
judgment
34
13
who
hath
given
him
a
charge
over
the
earth
or
who
hath
disposed
the
whole
world
34
14
if
he
set
his
heart
upon
man
if
he
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
his
breath
34
15
all
flesh
shall
perish
together
and
man
shall
turn
again
unto
dust
34
16
if
now
thou
hast
understanding
hear
this
hearken
to
the
voice
of
my
words
34
17
shall
even
he
that
hateth
right
govern
and
wilt
thou
condemn
him
that
is
most
just
34
18
is
it
fit
to
say
to
a
king
thou
art
wicked
and
to
princes
ye
are
ungodly
34
19
how
much
less
to
him
that
accepteth
not
the
persons
of
princes
nor
regardeth
the
rich
more
than
the
poor
for
they
all
are
the
work
of
his
hands
34
20
in
a
moment
shall
they
die
and
the
people
shall
be
troubled
at
midnight
and
pass
away
and
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
without
hand
34
21
for
his
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
of
man
and
he
seeth
all
his
goings
34
22
there
is
no
darkness
nor
shadow
of
death
where
the
workers
of
iniquity
may
hide
themselves
34
23
for
he
will
not
lay
upon
man
more
than
right
that
he
should
enter
into
judgment
with
god
34
24
he
shall
break
in
pieces
mighty
men
without
number
and
set
others
in
their
stead
34
25
therefore
he
knoweth
their
works
and
he
overturneth
them
in
the
night
so
that
they
are
destroyed
34
26
he
striketh
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
others
34
27
because
they
turned
back
from
him
and
would
not
consider
any
of
his
ways
34
28
so
that
they
cause
the
cry
of
the
poor
to
come
unto
him
and
he
heareth
the
cry
of
the
afflicted
34
29
when
he
giveth
quietness
who
then
can
make
trouble
and
when
he
hideth
his
face
who
then
can
behold
him
whether
it
be
done
against
a
nation
or
against
a
man
only
34
30
that
the
hypocrite
reign
not
lest
the
people
be
ensnared
34
31
surely
it
is
meet
to
be
said
unto
god
i
have
borne
chastisement
i
will
not
offend
any
more
34
32
that
which
i
see
not
teach
thou
me
if
i
have
done
iniquity
i
will
do
no
more
34
33
should
it
be
according
to
thy
mind
he
will
recompense
it
whether
thou
refuse
or
whether
thou
choose
and
not
i
therefore
speak
what
thou
knowest
34
34
let
men
of
understanding
tell
me
and
let
a
wise
man
hearken
unto
me
34
35
job
hath
spoken
without
knowledge
and
his
words
were
without
wisdom
34
36
my
desire
is
that
job
may
be
tried
unto
the
end
because
of
his
answers
for
wicked
men
34
37
for
he
addeth
rebellion
unto
his
sin
he
clappeth
his
hands
among
us
and
multiplieth
his
words
against
god
35
1
elihu
spake
moreover
and
said
35
2
thinkest
thou
this
to
be
right
that
thou
saidst
my
righteousness
is
more
than
god’s
35
3
for
thou
saidst
what
advantage
will
it
be
unto
thee
and
what
profit
shall
i
have
if
i
be
cleansed
from
my
sin
35
4
i
will
answer
thee
and
thy
companions
with
thee
35
5
look
unto
the
heavens
and
see
and
behold
the
clouds
which
are
higher
than
thou
35
6
if
thou
sinnest
what
doest
thou
against
him
or
if
thy
transgressions
be
multiplied
what
doest
thou
unto
him
35
7
if
thou
be
righteous
what
givest
thou
him
or
what
receiveth
he
of
thine
hand
35
8
thy
wickedness
may
hurt
a
man
as
thou
art
and
thy
righteousness
may
profit
the
son
of
man
35
9
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
oppressions
they
make
the
oppressed
to
cry
they
cry
out
by
reason
of
the
arm
of
the
mighty
35
10
but
none
saith
where
is
god
my
maker
who
giveth
songs
in
the
night
35
11
who
teacheth
us
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
maketh
us
wiser
than
the
fowls
of
heaven
35
12
there
they
cry
but
none
giveth
answer
because
of
the
pride
of
evil
men
35
13
surely
god
will
not
hear
vanity
neither
will
the
almighty
regard
it
35
14
although
thou
sayest
thou
shalt
not
see
him
yet
judgment
is
before
him
therefore
trust
thou
in
him
35
15
but
now
because
it
is
not
so
he
hath
visited
in
his
anger
yet
he
knoweth
it
not
in
great
extremity
35
16
therefore
doth
job
open
his
mouth
in
vain
he
multiplieth
words
without
knowledge
36
1
elihu
also
proceeded
and
said
36
2
suffer
me
a
little
and
i
will
shew
thee
that
i
have
yet
to
speak
on
god’s
behalf
36
3
i
will
fetch
my
knowledge
from
afar
and
will
ascribe
righteousness
to
my
maker
36
4
for
truly
my
words
shall
not
be
false
he
that
is
perfect
in
knowledge
is
with
thee
36
5
behold
god
is
mighty
and
despiseth
not
any
he
is
mighty
in
strength
and
wisdom
36
6
he
preserveth
not
the
life
of
the
wicked
but
giveth
right
to
the
poor
36
7
he
withdraweth
not
his
eyes
from
the
righteous
but
with
kings
are
they
on
the
throne
yea
he
doth
establish
them
for
ever
and
they
are
exalted
36
8
and
if
they
be
bound
in
fetters
and
be
holden
in
cords
of
affliction
36
9
then
he
sheweth
them
their
work
and
their
transgressions
that
they
have
exceeded
36
10
he
openeth
also
their
ear
to
discipline
and
commandeth
that
they
return
from
iniquity
36
11
if
they
obey
and
serve
him
they
shall
spend
their
days
in
prosperity
and
their
years
in
pleasures
36
12
but
if
they
obey
not
they
shall
perish
by
the
sword
and
they
shall
die
without
knowledge
36
13
but
the
hypocrites
in
heart
heap
up
wrath
they
cry
not
when
he
bindeth
them
36
14
they
die
in
youth
and
their
life
is
among
the
unclean
36
15
he
delivereth
the
poor
in
his
affliction
and
openeth
their
ears
in
oppression
36
16
even
so
would
he
have
removed
thee
out
of
the
strait
into
a
broad
place
where
there
is
no
straitness
and
that
which
should
be
set
on
thy
table
should
be
full
of
fatness
36
17
but
thou
hast
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
wicked
judgment
and
justice
take
hold
on
thee
36
18
because
there
is
wrath
beware
lest
he
take
thee
away
with
his
stroke
then
a
great
ransom
cannot
deliver
thee
36
19
will
he
esteem
thy
riches
no
not
gold
nor
all
the
forces
of
strength
36
20
desire
not
the
night
when
people
are
cut
off
in
their
place
36
21
take
heed
regard
not
iniquity
for
this
hast
thou
chosen
rather
than
affliction
36
22
behold
god
exalteth
by
his
power
who
teacheth
like
him
36
23
who
hath
enjoined
him
his
way
or
who
can
say
thou
hast
wrought
iniquity
36
24
remember
that
thou
magnify
his
work
which
men
behold
36
25
every
man
may
see
it
man
may
behold
it
afar
off
36
26
behold
god
is
great
and
we
know
him
not
neither
can
the
number
of
his
years
be
searched
out
36
27
for
he
maketh
small
the
drops
of
water
they
pour
down
rain
according
to
the
vapour
thereof
36
28
which
the
clouds
do
drop
and
distil
upon
man
abundantly
36
29
also
can
any
understand
the
spreadings
of
the
clouds
or
the
noise
of
his
tabernacle
36
30
behold
he
spreadeth
his
light
upon
it
and
covereth
the
bottom
of
the
sea
36
31
for
by
them
judgeth
he
the
people
he
giveth
meat
in
abundance
36
32
with
clouds
he
covereth
the
light
and
commandeth
it
not
to
shine
by
the
cloud
that
cometh
betwixt
36
33
the
noise
thereof
sheweth
concerning
it
the
cattle
also
concerning
the
vapour
37
1
at
this
also
my
heart
trembleth
and
is
moved
out
of
his
place
37
2
hear
attentively
the
noise
of
his
voice
and
the
sound
that
goeth
out
of
his
mouth
37
3
he
directeth
it
under
the
whole
heaven
and
his
lightning
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
37
4
after
it
a
voice
roareth
he
thundereth
with
the
voice
of
his
excellency
and
he
will
not
stay
them
when
his
voice
is
heard
37
5
god
thundereth
marvellously
with
his
voice
great
things
doeth
he
which
we
cannot
comprehend
37
6
for
he
saith
to
the
snow
be
thou
on
the
earth
likewise
to
the
small
rain
and
to
the
great
rain
of
his
strength
37
7
he
sealeth
up
the
hand
of
every
man
that
all
men
may
know
his
work
37
8
then
the
beasts
go
into
dens
and
remain
in
their
places
37
9
out
of
the
south
cometh
the
whirlwind
and
cold
out
of
the
north
37
10
by
the
breath
of
god
frost
is
given
and
the
breadth
of
the
waters
is
straitened
37
11
also
by
watering
he
wearieth
the
thick
cloud
he
scattereth
his
bright
cloud
37
12
and
it
is
turned
round
about
by
his
counsels
that
they
may
do
whatsoever
he
commandeth
them
upon
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
earth
37
13
he
causeth
it
to
come
whether
for
correction
or
for
his
land
or
for
mercy
37
14
hearken
unto
this
o
job
stand
still
and
consider
the
wondrous
works
of
god
37
15
dost
thou
know
when
god
disposed
them
and
caused
the
light
of
his
cloud
to
shine
37
16
dost
thou
know
the
balancings
of
the
clouds
the
wondrous
works
of
him
which
is
perfect
in
knowledge
37
17
how
thy
garments
are
warm
when
he
quieteth
the
earth
by
the
south
wind
37
18
hast
thou
with
him
spread
out
the
sky
which
is
strong
and
as
a
molten
looking
glass
37
19
teach
us
what
we
shall
say
unto
him
for
we
cannot
order
our
speech
by
reason
of
darkness
37
20
shall
it
be
told
him
that
i
speak
if
a
man
speak
surely
he
shall
be
swallowed
up
37
21
and
now
men
see
not
the
bright
light
which
is
in
the
clouds
but
the
wind
passeth
and
cleanseth
them
37
22
fair
weather
cometh
out
of
the
north
with
god
is
terrible
majesty
37
23
touching
the
almighty
we
cannot
find
him
out
he
is
excellent
in
power
and
in
judgment
and
in
plenty
of
justice
he
will
not
afflict
37
24
men
do
therefore
fear
him
he
respecteth
not
any
that
are
wise
of
heart
38
1
then
the
lord
answered
job
out
of
the
whirlwind
and
said
38
2
who
is
this
that
darkeneth
counsel
by
words
without
knowledge
38
3
gird
up
now
thy
loins
like
a
man
for
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
answer
thou
me
38
4
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
declare
if
thou
hast
understanding
38
5
who
hath
laid
the
measures
thereof
if
thou
knowest
or
who
hath
stretched
the
line
upon
it
38
6
whereupon
are
the
foundations
thereof
fastened
or
who
laid
the
corner
stone
thereof
38
7
when
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
38
8
or
who
shut
up
the
sea
with
doors
when
it
brake
forth
as
if
it
had
issued
out
of
the
womb
38
9
when
i
made
the
cloud
the
garment
thereof
and
thick
darkness
a
swaddlingband
for
it
38
10
and
brake
up
for
it
my
decreed
place
and
set
bars
and
doors
38
11
and
said
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
but
no
further
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
38
12
hast
thou
commanded
the
morning
since
thy
days
and
caused
the
dayspring
to
know
his
place
38
13
that
it
might
take
hold
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
that
the
wicked
might
be
shaken
out
of
it
38
14
it
is
turned
as
clay
to
the
seal
and
they
stand
as
a
garment
38
15
and
from
the
wicked
their
light
is
withholden
and
the
high
arm
shall
be
broken
38
16
hast
thou
entered
into
the
springs
of
the
sea
or
hast
thou
walked
in
the
search
of
the
depth
38
17
have
the
gates
of
death
been
opened
unto
thee
or
hast
thou
seen
the
doors
of
the
shadow
of
death
38
18
hast
thou
perceived
the
breadth
of
the
earth
declare
if
thou
knowest
it
all
38
19
where
is
the
way
where
light
dwelleth
and
as
for
darkness
where
is
the
place
thereof
38
20
that
thou
shouldest
take
it
to
the
bound
thereof
and
that
thou
shouldest
know
the
paths
to
the
house
thereof
38
21
knowest
thou
it
because
thou
wast
then
born
or
because
the
number
of
thy
days
is
great
38
22
hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail
38
23
which
i
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war
38
24
by
what
way
is
the
light
parted
which
scattereth
the
east
wind
upon
the
earth
38
25
who
hath
divided
a
watercourse
for
the
overflowing
of
waters
or
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
thunder
38
26
to
cause
it
to
rain
on
the
earth
where
no
man
is
on
the
wilderness
wherein
there
is
no
man
38
27
to
satisfy
the
desolate
and
waste
ground
and
to
cause
the
bud
of
the
tender
herb
to
spring
forth
38
28
hath
the
rain
a
father
or
who
hath
begotten
the
drops
of
dew
38
29
out
of
whose
womb
came
the
ice
and
the
hoary
frost
of
heaven
who
hath
gendered
it
38
30
the
waters
are
hid
as
with
a
stone
and
the
face
of
the
deep
is
frozen
38
31
canst
thou
bind
the
sweet
influences
of
pleiades
or
loose
the
bands
of
orion
38
32
canst
thou
bring
forth
mazzaroth
in
his
season
or
canst
thou
guide
arcturus
with
his
sons
38
33
knowest
thou
the
ordinances
of
heaven
canst
thou
set
the
dominion
thereof
in
the
earth
38
34
canst
thou
lift
up
thy
voice
to
the
clouds
that
abundance
of
waters
may
cover
thee
38
35
canst
thou
send
lightnings
that
they
may
go
and
say
unto
thee
here
we
are
38
36
who
hath
put
wisdom
in
the
inward
parts
or
who
hath
given
understanding
to
the
heart
38
37
who
can
number
the
clouds
in
wisdom
or
who
can
stay
the
bottles
of
heaven
38
38
when
the
dust
groweth
into
hardness
and
the
clods
cleave
fast
together
38
39
wilt
thou
hunt
the
prey
for
the
lion
or
fill
the
appetite
of
the
young
lions
38
40
when
they
couch
in
their
dens
and
abide
in
the
covert
to
lie
in
wait
38
41
who
provideth
for
the
raven
his
food
when
his
young
ones
cry
unto
god
they
wander
for
lack
of
meat
39
1
knowest
thou
the
time
when
the
wild
goats
of
the
rock
bring
forth
or
canst
thou
mark
when
the
hinds
do
calve
39
2
canst
thou
number
the
months
that
they
fulfil
or
knowest
thou
the
time
when
they
bring
forth
39
3
they
bow
themselves
they
bring
forth
their
young
ones
they
cast
out
their
sorrows
39
4
their
young
ones
are
in
good
liking
they
grow
up
with
corn
they
go
forth
and
return
not
unto
them
39
5
who
hath
sent
out
the
wild
ass
free
or
who
hath
loosed
the
bands
of
the
wild
ass
39
6
whose
house
i
have
made
the
wilderness
and
the
barren
land
his
dwellings
39
7
he
scorneth
the
multitude
of
the
city
neither
regardeth
he
the
crying
of
the
driver
39
8
the
range
of
the
mountains
is
his
pasture
and
he
searcheth
after
every
green
thing
39
9
will
the
unicorn
be
willing
to
serve
thee
or
abide
by
thy
crib
39
10
canst
thou
bind
the
unicorn
with
his
band
in
the
furrow
or
will
he
harrow
the
valleys
after
thee
39
11
wilt
thou
trust
him
because
his
strength
is
great
or
wilt
thou
leave
thy
labour
to
him
39
12
wilt
thou
believe
him
that
he
will
bring
home
thy
seed
and
gather
it
into
thy
barn
39
13
gavest
thou
the
goodly
wings
unto
the
peacocks
or
wings
and
feathers
unto
the
ostrich
39
14
which
leaveth
her
eggs
in
the
earth
and
warmeth
them
in
dust
39
15
and
forgetteth
that
the
foot
may
crush
them
or
that
the
wild
beast
may
break
them
39
16
she
is
hardened
against
her
young
ones
as
though
they
were
not
hers
her
labour
is
in
vain
without
fear
39
17
because
god
hath
deprived
her
of
wisdom
neither
hath
he
imparted
to
her
understanding
39
18
what
time
she
lifteth
up
herself
on
high
she
scorneth
the
horse
and
his
rider
39
19
hast
thou
given
the
horse
strength
hast
thou
clothed
his
neck
with
thunder
39
20
canst
thou
make
him
afraid
as
a
grasshopper
the
glory
of
his
nostrils
is
terrible
39
21
he
paweth
in
the
valley
and
rejoiceth
in
his
strength
he
goeth
on
to
meet
the
armed
men
39
22
he
mocketh
at
fear
and
is
not
affrighted
neither
turneth
he
back
from
the
sword
39
23
the
quiver
rattleth
against
him
the
glittering
spear
and
the
shield
39
24
he
swalloweth
the
ground
with
fierceness
and
rage
neither
believeth
he
that
it
is
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
39
25
he
saith
among
the
trumpets
ha
ha
and
he
smelleth
the
battle
afar
off
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
39
26
doth
the
hawk
fly
by
thy
wisdom
and
stretch
her
wings
toward
the
south
39
27
doth
the
eagle
mount
up
at
thy
command
and
make
her
nest
on
high
39
28
she
dwelleth
and
abideth
on
the
rock
upon
the
crag
of
the
rock
and
the
strong
place
39
29
from
thence
she
seeketh
the
prey
and
her
eyes
behold
afar
off
39
30
her
young
ones
also
suck
up
blood
and
where
the
slain
are
there
is
she
40
1
moreover
the
lord
answered
job
and
said
40
2
shall
he
that
contendeth
with
the
almighty
instruct
him
he
that
reproveth
god
let
him
answer
it
40
3
then
job
answered
the
lord
and
said
40
4
behold
i
am
vile
what
shall
i
answer
thee
i
will
lay
mine
hand
upon
my
mouth
40
5
once
have
i
spoken
but
i
will
not
answer
yea
twice
but
i
will
proceed
no
further
40
6
then
answered
the
lord
unto
job
out
of
the
whirlwind
and
said
40
7
gird
up
thy
loins
now
like
a
man
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
me
40
8
wilt
thou
also
disannul
my
judgment
wilt
thou
condemn
me
that
thou
mayest
be
righteous
40
9
hast
thou
an
arm
like
god
or
canst
thou
thunder
with
a
voice
like
him
40
10
deck
thyself
now
with
majesty
and
excellency
and
array
thyself
with
glory
and
beauty
40
11
cast
abroad
the
rage
of
thy
wrath
and
behold
every
one
that
is
proud
and
abase
him
40
12
look
on
every
one
that
is
proud
and
bring
him
low
and
tread
down
the
wicked
in
their
place
40
13
hide
them
in
the
dust
together
and
bind
their
faces
in
secret
40
14
then
will
i
also
confess
unto
thee
that
thine
own
right
hand
can
save
thee
40
15
behold
now
behemoth
which
i
made
with
thee
he
eateth
grass
as
an
ox
40
16
lo
now
his
strength
is
in
his
loins
and
his
force
is
in
the
navel
of
his
belly
40
17
he
moveth
his
tail
like
a
cedar
the
sinews
of
his
stones
are
wrapped
together
40
18
his
bones
are
as
strong
pieces
of
brass
his
bones
are
like
bars
of
iron
40
19
he
is
the
chief
of
the
ways
of
god
he
that
made
him
can
make
his
sword
to
approach
unto
him
40
20
surely
the
mountains
bring
him
forth
food
where
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
play
40
21
he
lieth
under
the
shady
trees
in
the
covert
of
the
reed
and
fens
40
22
the
shady
trees
cover
him
with
their
shadow
the
willows
of
the
brook
compass
him
about
40
23
behold
he
drinketh
up
a
river
and
hasteth
not
he
trusteth
that
he
can
draw
up
jordan
into
his
mouth
40
24
he
taketh
it
with
his
eyes
his
nose
pierceth
through
snares
41
1
canst
thou
draw
out
leviathan
with
an
hook
or
his
tongue
with
a
cord
which
thou
lettest
down
41
2
canst
thou
put
an
hook
into
his
nose
or
bore
his
jaw
through
with
a
thorn
41
3
will
he
make
many
supplications
unto
thee
will
he
speak
soft
words
unto
thee
41
4
will
he
make
a
covenant
with
thee
wilt
thou
take
him
for
a
servant
for
ever
41
5
wilt
thou
play
with
him
as
with
a
bird
or
wilt
thou
bind
him
for
thy
maidens
41
6
shall
the
companions
make
a
banquet
of
him
shall
they
part
him
among
the
merchants
41
7
canst
thou
fill
his
skin
with
barbed
irons
or
his
head
with
fish
spears
41
8
lay
thine
hand
upon
him
remember
the
battle
do
no
more
41
9
behold
the
hope
of
him
is
in
vain
shall
not
one
be
cast
down
even
at
the
sight
of
him
41
10
none
is
so
fierce
that
dare
stir
him
up
who
then
is
able
to
stand
before
me
41
11
who
hath
prevented
me
that
i
should
repay
him
whatsoever
is
under
the
whole
heaven
is
mine
41
12
i
will
not
conceal
his
parts
nor
his
power
nor
his
comely
proportion
41
13
who
can
discover
the
face
of
his
garment
or
who
can
come
to
him
with
his
double
bridle
41
14
who
can
open
the
doors
of
his
face
his
teeth
are
terrible
round
about
41
15
his
scales
are
his
pride
shut
up
together
as
with
a
close
seal
41
16
one
is
so
near
to
another
that
no
air
can
come
between
them
41
17
they
are
joined
one
to
another
they
stick
together
that
they
cannot
be
sundered
41
18
by
his
neesings
a
light
doth
shine
and
his
eyes
are
like
the
eyelids
of
the
morning
41
19
out
of
his
mouth
go
burning
lamps
and
sparks
of
fire
leap
out
41
20
out
of
his
nostrils
goeth
smoke
as
out
of
a
seething
pot
or
caldron
41
21
his
breath
kindleth
coals
and
a
flame
goeth
out
of
his
mouth
41
22
in
his
neck
remaineth
strength
and
sorrow
is
turned
into
joy
before
him
41
23
the
flakes
of
his
flesh
are
joined
together
they
are
firm
in
themselves
they
cannot
be
moved
41
24
his
heart
is
as
firm
as
a
stone
yea
as
hard
as
a
piece
of
the
nether
millstone
41
25
when
he
raiseth
up
himself
the
mighty
are
afraid
by
reason
of
breakings
they
purify
themselves
41
26
the
sword
of
him
that
layeth
at
him
cannot
hold
the
spear
the
dart
nor
the
habergeon
41
27
he
esteemeth
iron
as
straw
and
brass
as
rotten
wood
41
28
the
arrow
cannot
make
him
flee
slingstones
are
turned
with
him
into
stubble
41
29
darts
are
counted
as
stubble
he
laugheth
at
the
shaking
of
a
spear
41
30
sharp
stones
are
under
him
he
spreadeth
sharp
pointed
things
upon
the
mire
41
31
he
maketh
the
deep
to
boil
like
a
pot
he
maketh
the
sea
like
a
pot
of
ointment
41
32
he
maketh
a
path
to
shine
after
him
one
would
think
the
deep
to
be
hoary
41
33
upon
earth
there
is
not
his
like
who
is
made
without
fear
41
34
he
beholdeth
all
high
things
he
is
a
king
over
all
the
children
of
pride
42
1
then
job
answered
the
lord
and
said
42
2
i
know
that
thou
canst
do
every
thing
and
that
no
thought
can
be
withholden
from
thee
42
3
who
is
he
that
hideth
counsel
without
knowledge
therefore
have
i
uttered
that
i
understood
not
things
too
wonderful
for
me
which
i
knew
not
42
4
hear
i
beseech
thee
and
i
will
speak
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
me
42
5
i
have
heard
of
thee
by
the
hearing
of
the
ear
but
now
mine
eye
seeth
thee
42
6
wherefore
i
abhor
myself
and
repent
in
dust
and
ashes
42
7
and
it
was
so
that
after
the
lord
had
spoken
these
words
unto
job
the
lord
said
to
eliphaz
the
temanite
my
wrath
is
kindled
against
thee
and
against
thy
two
friends
for
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
that
is
right
as
my
servant
job
hath
42
8
therefore
take
unto
you
now
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
and
go
to
my
servant
job
and
offer
up
for
yourselves
a
burnt
offering
and
my
servant
job
shall
pray
for
you
for
him
will
i
accept
lest
i
deal
with
you
after
your
folly
in
that
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
which
is
right
like
my
servant
job
42
9
so
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
bildad
the
shuhite
and
zophar
the
naamathite
went
and
did
according
as
the
lord
commanded
them
the
lord
also
accepted
job
42
10
and
the
lord
turned
the
captivity
of
job
when
he
prayed
for
his
friends
also
the
lord
gave
job
twice
as
much
as
he
had
before
42
11
then
came
there
unto
him
all
his
brethren
and
all
his
sisters
and
all
they
that
had
been
of
his
acquaintance
before
and
did
eat
bread
with
him
in
his
house
and
they
bemoaned
him
and
comforted
him
over
all
the
evil
that
the
lord
had
brought
upon
him
every
man
also
gave
him
a
piece
of
money
and
every
one
an
earring
of
gold
42
12
so
the
lord
blessed
the
latter
end
of
job
more
than
his
beginning
for
he
had
fourteen
thousand
sheep
and
six
thousand
camels
and
a
thousand
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
thousand
she
asses
42
13
he
had
also
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
42
14
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
first
jemima
and
the
name
of
the
second
kezia
and
the
name
of
the
third
kerenhappuch
42
15
and
in
all
the
land
were
no
women
found
so
fair
as
the
daughters
of
job
and
their
father
gave
them
inheritance
among
their
brethren
42
16
after
this
lived
job
an
hundred
and
forty
years
and
saw
his
sons
and
his
sons’
sons
even
four
generations
42
17
so
job
died
being
old
and
full
of
days
the
book
of
psalms
1
1
blessed
is
the
man
that
walketh
not
in
the
counsel
of
the
ungodly
nor
standeth
in
the
way
of
sinners
nor
sitteth
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful
1
2
but
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
the
lord
and
in
his
law
doth
he
meditate
day
and
night
1
3
and
he
shall
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
that
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
season
his
leaf
also
shall
not
wither
and
whatsoever
he
doeth
shall
prosper
1
4
the
ungodly
are
not
so
but
are
like
the
chaff
which
the
wind
driveth
away
1
5
therefore
the
ungodly
shall
not
stand
in
the
judgment
nor
sinners
in
the
congregation
of
the
righteous
1
6
for
the
lord
knoweth
the
way
of
the
righteous
but
the
way
of
the
ungodly
shall
perish
2
1
why
do
the
heathen
rage
and
the
people
imagine
a
vain
thing
2
2
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
saying
2
3
let
us
break
their
bands
asunder
and
cast
away
their
cords
from
us
2
4
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
2
5
then
shall
he
speak
unto
them
in
his
wrath
and
vex
them
in
his
sore
displeasure
2
6
yet
have
i
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
zion
2
7
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
2
8
ask
of
me
and
i
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession
2
9
thou
shalt
break
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
thou
shalt
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter’s
vessel
2
10
be
wise
now
therefore
o
ye
kings
be
instructed
ye
judges
of
the
earth
2
11
serve
the
lord
with
fear
and
rejoice
with
trembling
2
12
kiss
the
son
lest
he
be
angry
and
ye
perish
from
the
way
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
little
blessed
are
all
they
that
put
their
trust
in
him
3
1
lord
how
are
they
increased
that
trouble
me
many
are
they
that
rise
up
against
me
3
2
many
there
be
which
say
of
my
soul
there
is
no
help
for
him
in
god
selah
3
3
but
thou
o
lord
art
a
shield
for
me
my
glory
and
the
lifter
up
of
mine
head
3
4
i
cried
unto
the
lord
with
my
voice
and
he
heard
me
out
of
his
holy
hill
selah
3
5
i
laid
me
down
and
slept
i
awaked
for
the
lord
sustained
me
3
6
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
ten
thousands
of
people
that
have
set
themselves
against
me
round
about
3
7
arise
o
lord
save
me
o
my
god
for
thou
hast
smitten
all
mine
enemies
upon
the
cheek
bone
thou
hast
broken
the
teeth
of
the
ungodly
3
8
salvation
belongeth
unto
the
lord
thy
blessing
is
upon
thy
people
selah
4
1
hear
me
when
i
call
o
god
of
my
righteousness
thou
hast
enlarged
me
when
i
was
in
distress
have
mercy
upon
me
and
hear
my
prayer
4
2
o
ye
sons
of
men
how
long
will
ye
turn
my
glory
into
shame
how
long
will
ye
love
vanity
and
seek
after
leasing
selah
4
3
but
know
that
the
lord
hath
set
apart
him
that
is
godly
for
himself
the
lord
will
hear
when
i
call
unto
him
4
4
stand
in
awe
and
sin
not
commune
with
your
own
heart
upon
your
bed
and
be
still
selah
4
5
offer
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
and
put
your
trust
in
the
lord
4
6
there
be
many
that
say
who
will
shew
us
any
good
lord
lift
thou
up
the
light
of
thy
countenance
upon
us
4
7
thou
hast
put
gladness
in
my
heart
more
than
in
the
time
that
their
corn
and
their
wine
increased
4
8
i
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
thou
lord
only
makest
me
dwell
in
safety
5
1
give
ear
to
my
words
o
lord
consider
my
meditation
5
2
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
my
cry
my
king
and
my
god
for
unto
thee
will
i
pray
5
3
my
voice
shalt
thou
hear
in
the
morning
o
lord
in
the
morning
will
i
direct
my
prayer
unto
thee
and
will
look
up
5
4
for
thou
art
not
a
god
that
hath
pleasure
in
wickedness
neither
shall
evil
dwell
with
thee
5
5
the
foolish
shall
not
stand
in
thy
sight
thou
hatest
all
workers
of
iniquity
5
6
thou
shalt
destroy
them
that
speak
leasing
the
lord
will
abhor
the
bloody
and
deceitful
man
5
7
but
as
for
me
i
will
come
into
thy
house
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
and
in
thy
fear
will
i
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple
5
8
lead
me
o
lord
in
thy
righteousness
because
of
mine
enemies
make
thy
way
straight
before
my
face
5
9
for
there
is
no
faithfulness
in
their
mouth
their
inward
part
is
very
wickedness
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre
they
flatter
with
their
tongue
5
10
destroy
thou
them
o
god
let
them
fall
by
their
own
counsels
cast
them
out
in
the
multitude
of
their
transgressions
for
they
have
rebelled
against
thee
5
11
but
let
all
those
that
put
their
trust
in
thee
rejoice
let
them
ever
shout
for
joy
because
thou
defendest
them
let
them
also
that
love
thy
name
be
joyful
in
thee
5
12
for
thou
lord
wilt
bless
the
righteous
with
favour
wilt
thou
compass
him
as
with
a
shield
6
1
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thine
anger
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure
6
2
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
for
i
am
weak
o
lord
heal
me
for
my
bones
are
vexed
6
3
my
soul
is
also
sore
vexed
but
thou
o
lord
how
long
6
4
return
o
lord
deliver
my
soul
oh
save
me
for
thy
mercies’
sake
6
5
for
in
death
there
is
no
remembrance
of
thee
in
the
grave
who
shall
give
thee
thanks
6
6
i
am
weary
with
my
groaning
all
the
night
make
i
my
bed
to
swim
i
water
my
couch
with
my
tears
6
7
mine
eye
is
consumed
because
of
grief
it
waxeth
old
because
of
all
mine
enemies
6
8
depart
from
me
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity
for
the
lord
hath
heard
the
voice
of
my
weeping
6
9
the
lord
hath
heard
my
supplication
the
lord
will
receive
my
prayer
6
10
let
all
mine
enemies
be
ashamed
and
sore
vexed
let
them
return
and
be
ashamed
suddenly
7
1
o
lord
my
god
in
thee
do
i
put
my
trust
save
me
from
all
them
that
persecute
me
and
deliver
me
7
2
lest
he
tear
my
soul
like
a
lion
rending
it
in
pieces
while
there
is
none
to
deliver
7
3
o
lord
my
god
if
i
have
done
this
if
there
be
iniquity
in
my
hands
7
4
if
i
have
rewarded
evil
unto
him
that
was
at
peace
with
me
(yea
i
have
delivered
him
that
without
cause
is
mine
enemy
)
7
5
let
the
enemy
persecute
my
soul
and
take
it
yea
let
him
tread
down
my
life
upon
the
earth
and
lay
mine
honour
in
the
dust
selah
7
6
arise
o
lord
in
thine
anger
lift
up
thyself
because
of
the
rage
of
mine
enemies
and
awake
for
me
to
the
judgment
that
thou
hast
commanded
7
7
so
shall
the
congregation
of
the
people
compass
thee
about
for
their
sakes
therefore
return
thou
on
high
7
8
the
lord
shall
judge
the
people
judge
me
o
lord
according
to
my
righteousness
and
according
to
mine
integrity
that
is
in
me
7
9
oh
let
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
come
to
an
end
but
establish
the
just
for
the
righteous
god
trieth
the
hearts
and
reins
7
10
my
defence
is
of
god
which
saveth
the
upright
in
heart
7
11
god
judgeth
the
righteous
and
god
is
angry
with
the
wicked
every
day
7
12
if
he
turn
not
he
will
whet
his
sword
he
hath
bent
his
bow
and
made
it
ready
7
13
he
hath
also
prepared
for
him
the
instruments
of
death
he
ordaineth
his
arrows
against
the
persecutors
7
14
behold
he
travaileth
with
iniquity
and
hath
conceived
mischief
and
brought
forth
falsehood
7
15
he
made
a
pit
and
digged
it
and
is
fallen
into
the
ditch
which
he

he
murder

doth
catch

their
bow

make
ready
their
arrow
upon
the
string
that
they
may
privily
shoot
at
the
upright
in
heart
11

if

can
the
righteous
do
11

lord’s
throne
is
in
heaven

him
that
loveth
violence

soul
hateth
11
6
upon
the
wicked
he
shall
rain
snares
fire
and
brimstone
and
an
horrible
tempest
this
shall
be
the
portion
of
their
cup

godly
man
ceaseth
for
the
faithful

from
among
the
children
of
men
12
2
they
speak
vanity
every
one
with
his
neighbour
with
flattering
lips
and
with
a
double
heart
do
they
speak
12
3
the
lord
shall
cut
off
all
flattering
lips
and
the
tongue
that
speaketh
proud
things
12
4
who
have
said
with
our
tongue
will
we
prevail
our
lips
are
our
own
who
is
lord
over
us
12
5
for
the
oppression
of
the
poor
for
the
sighing
of
the
needy
now
will
i
arise
saith
the
lord
i
will
set
him
in
safety
from
him
that
puffeth
at
him
12
6
the
words
of
the
lord
are
pure
words
as
silver
tried
in
a
furnace
of
earth
purified
seven
times
12
7
thou
shalt
keep
them
o
lord
thou
shalt
preserve
them
from
this
generation
for
ever
12
8
the
wicked
walk
on
every
side
when
the
vilest
men
are
exalted
13
1
how
long
wilt
thou
forget
me
o
lord
for
ever
how
long
wilt
thou
hide
thy
face
from
me
13
2
how
long
shall
i
take
counsel
in
my
soul
having
sorrow
in
my
heart
daily
how
long
shall
mine
enemy
be
exalted
over
me
13
3
consider
and
hear
me
o
lord
my
god
lighten
mine
eyes
lest
i
sleep
the
sleep
of
death
13
4
lest
mine
enemy
say
i
have
prevailed
against
him
and
those
that
trouble
me
rejoice
when
i
am
moved
13
5
but
i
have
trusted
in
thy
mercy
my
heart
shall
rejoice
in
thy
salvation
13
6
i
will
sing
unto
the
lord
because
he
hath
dealt
bountifully
with
me
14
1
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
they
are
corrupt
they
have
done
abominable
works
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
14
2
the
lord
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
the
children
of
men
to
see
if
there
were
any
that
did
understand
and
seek
god
14
3
they
are
all
gone
aside
they
are
all
together
become
filthy
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
14
4
have
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
no
knowledge
who
eat
up
my
people
as
they
eat
bread
and
call
not
upon
the
lord
14
5
there
were
they
in
great
fear
for
god
is
in
the
generation
of
the
righteous
14
6
ye
have
shamed
the
counsel
of
the
poor
because
the
lord
is
his
refuge
14
7
oh
that
the
salvation
of
israel
were
come
out
of
zion
when
the
lord
bringeth
back
the
captivity
of
his
people
jacob
shall
rejoice
and
israel
shall
be
glad
15
1
lord
who
shall
abide
in
thy
tabernacle
who
shall
dwell
in
thy
holy
hill
15
2
he
that
walketh
uprightly
and
worketh
righteousness
and
speaketh
the
truth
in
his
heart
15
3
he
that
backbiteth
not
with
his
tongue
nor
doeth
evil
to
his
neighbour
nor
taketh
up
a
reproach
against
his
neighbour
15
4
in
whose
eyes
a
vile
person
is
contemned
but
he
honoureth
them
that
fear
the
lord
he
that
sweareth
to
his
own
hurt
and
changeth
not
15
5
he
that
putteth
not
out
his
money
to
usury
nor
taketh
reward
against
the
innocent
he
that
doeth
these
things
shall
never
be
moved
16
1
preserve
me
o
god
for
in
thee
do
i
put
my
trust
16
2
o
my
soul
thou
hast
said
unto
the
lord
thou
art
my
lord
my
goodness
extendeth
not
to
thee
16
3
but
to
the
saints
that
are
in
the
earth
and
to
the
excellent
in
whom
is
all
my
delight
16
4
their
sorrows
shall
be
multiplied
that
hasten
after
another
god
their
drink
offerings
of
blood
will
i
not
offer
nor
take
up
their
names
into
my
lips
16
5
the
lord
is
the
portion
of
mine
inheritance
and
of
my
cup
thou
maintainest
my
lot
16
6
the
lines
are
fallen
unto
me
in
pleasant
places
yea
i
have
a
goodly
heritage
16
7
i
will
bless
the
lord
who
hath
given
me
counsel
my
reins
also
instruct
me
in
the
night
seasons
16
8
i
have
set
the
lord
always
before
me
because
he
is
at
my
right
hand
i
shall
not
be
moved
16
9
therefore
my
heart
is
glad
and
my
glory
rejoiceth
my
flesh
also
shall
rest
in
hope
16
10
for
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
16
11
thou
wilt
shew
me
the
path
of
life
in
thy
presence
is
fulness
of
joy
at
thy
right
hand
there
are
pleasures
for
evermore
17
1

right
o
lord
attend
unto
my
cry
give
ear
unto
my
prayer
that
goeth
not
out
of
feigned
lips
17
2
let
my
sentence
come
forth
from
thy
presence
let
thine
eyes
behold
the
things
that
are
equal
17
3
thou
hast
proved
mine
heart
thou
hast
visited
me
in
the
night
thou
hast
tried
me
and
shalt
find
nothing
i
am
purposed
that
my
mouth
shall
not
transgress
17
4
concerning
the
works
of
men
by
the
word
of
thy
lips
i
have
kept
me
from
the
paths
of
the
destroyer
17
5
hold
up
my
goings
in
thy
paths
that
my
footsteps
slip
not
17
6
i
have
called
upon
thee
for
thou
wilt
hear
me
o
god
incline
thine
ear
unto
me
and
hear
my
speech
17
7
shew
thy
marvellous
lovingkindness
o
thou
that
savest
by
thy
right
hand
them
which
put
their
trust
in
thee
from
those
that
rise
up
against
them
17
8
keep
me
as
the
apple
of
the
eye
hide
me
under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
17
9
from
the
wicked
that
oppress
me
from
my
deadly
enemies
who
compass
me
about
17
10
they
are
inclosed
in
their
own
fat
with
their
mouth
they
speak
proudly
17
11
they
have
now
compassed
us
in
our
steps
they
have
set
their
eyes
bowing
down
to
the
earth
17
12
like
as
a
lion
that
is
greedy
of
his
prey
and
as
it
were
a
young
lion
lurking
in
secret
places
17
13
arise
o
lord
disappoint
him
cast
him
down
deliver
my
soul
from
the
wicked
which
is
thy
sword
17
14
from
men
which
are
thy
hand
o
lord
from
men
of
the
world
which
have
their
portion
in
this
life
and
whose
belly
thou
fillest
with
thy
hid
treasure
they
are
full
of
children
and
leave
the
rest
of
their
substance
to
their
babes
17
15
as
for
me
i
will
behold
thy
face
in
righteousness
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
likeness
18
1
i
will
love
thee
o
lord
my
strength
18
2
the
lord
is
my
rock
and
my
fortress
and
my
deliverer
my
god
my
strength
in
whom
i
will
trust
my
buckler
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation
and
my
high
tower
18
3
i
will
call
upon
the
lord
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised
so
shall
i
be
saved
from
mine
enemies
18
4
the
sorrows
of
death
compassed
me
and
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid
18
5
the
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me
18
6
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
and
cried
unto
my
god
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
came
before
him
even
into
his
ears
18
7
then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
the
foundations
also
of
the
hills
moved
and
were
shaken
because
he
was
wroth
18
8
there
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured
coals
were
kindled
by
it
18
9
he
bowed
the
heavens
also
and
came
down
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet
18
10
and
he
rode
upon
a
cherub
and
did
fly
yea
he
did
fly
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
18
11
he
made
darkness
his
secret
place
his
pavilion
round
about
him
were
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
18
12
at
the
brightness
that
was
before
him
his
thick
clouds
passed
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire
18
13
the
lord
also
thundered
in
the
heavens
and
the
highest
gave
his
voice
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire
18
14
yea
he
sent
out
his
arrows
and
scattered
them
and
he
shot
out
lightnings
and
discomfited
them
18
15
then
the
channels
of
waters
were
seen
and
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered
at
thy
rebuke
o
lord
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
thy
nostrils
18
16
he
sent
from
above
he
took
me
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters
18
17
he
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy
and
from
them
which
hated
me
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me
18
18
they
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity
but
the
lord
was
my
stay
18
19
he
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place
he
delivered
me
because
he
delighted
in
me
18
20
the
lord
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me
18
21
for
i
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
god
18
22
for
all
his
judgments
were
before
me
and
i
did
not
put
away
his
statutes
from
me
18
23
i
was
also
upright
before
him
and
i
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity
18
24
therefore
hath
the
lord
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
in
his
eyesight
18
25
with
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful
with
an
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright
18
26
with
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
froward
18
27
for
thou
wilt
save
the
afflicted
people
but
wilt
bring
down
high
looks
18
28
for
thou
wilt
light
my
candle
the
lord
my
god
will
enlighten
my
darkness
18
29
for
by
thee
i
have
run
through
a
troop
and
by
my
god
have
i
leaped
over
a
wall
18
30
as
for
god
his
way
is
perfect
the
word
of
the
lord
is
tried
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
those
that
trust
in
him
18
31
for
who
is
god
save
the
lord
or
who
is
a
rock
save
our
god
18
32
it
is
god
that
girdeth
me
with
strength
and
maketh
my
way
perfect
18
33
he
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds’
feet
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places
18
34
he
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms
18
35
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation
and
thy
right
hand
hath
holden
me
up
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great
18
36
thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me
that
my
feet
did
not
slip
18
37
i
have
pursued
mine
enemies
and
overtaken
them
neither
did
i
turn
again
till
they
were
consumed
18
38
i
have
wounded
them
that
they
were
not
able
to
rise
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet
18
39
for
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
unto
the
battle
thou
hast
subdued
under
me
those
that
rose
up
against
me
18
40
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies
that
i
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me
18
41
they
cried
but
there
was
none
to
save
them
even
unto
the
lord
but
he
answered
them
not
18
42
then
did
i
beat
them
small
as
the
dust
before
the
wind
i
did
cast
them
out
as
the
dirt
in
the
streets
18
43
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
the
people
and
thou
hast
made
me
the
head
of
the
heathen
a
people
whom
i
have
not
known
shall
serve
me
18
44
as
soon
as
they
hear
of
me
they
shall
obey
me
the
strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me
18
45
the
strangers
shall
fade
away
and
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places
18
46
the
lord
liveth
and
blessed
be
my
rock
and
let
the
god
of
my
salvation
be
exalted
18
47
it
is
god
that
avengeth
me
and
subdueth
the
people
under
me
18
48
he
delivereth
me
from
mine
enemies
yea
thou
liftest
me
up
above
those
that
rise
up
against
me
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man
18
49
therefore
will
i
give
thanks
unto
thee
o
lord
among
the
heathen
and
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
18
50
great
deliverance
giveth
he
to
his
king
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed
to
david
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore
19
1
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
sheweth
his
handywork
19
2
day
unto
day
uttereth
speech
and
night
unto
night
sheweth
knowledge
19
3
there
is
no
speech
nor
language
where
their
voice
is
not
heard
19
4
their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth
and
their
words
to
the
end
of
the
world
in
them
hath
he
set
a
tabernacle
for
the
sun
19
5
which
is
as
a
bridegroom
coming
out
of
his
chamber
and
rejoiceth
as
a
strong
man
to
run
a
race
19
6
his
going
forth
is
from
the
end
of
the
heaven
and
his
circuit
unto
the
ends
of
it
and
there
is
nothing
hid
from
the
heat
thereof
19
7
the
law
of
the
lord
is
perfect
converting
the
soul
the
testimony
of
the
lord
is
sure
making
wise
the
simple
19
8
the
statutes
of
the
lord
are
right
rejoicing
the
heart
the
commandment
of
the
lord
is
pure
enlightening
the
eyes
19
9
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
clean
enduring
for
ever
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
19
10
more
to
be
desired
are
they
than
gold
yea
than
much
fine
gold
sweeter
also
than
honey
and
the
honeycomb
19
11
moreover
by
them
is
thy
servant
warned
and
in
keeping
of
them
there
is
great
reward
19
12
who
can
understand
his
errors
cleanse
thou
me
from
secret
faults
19
13
keep
back
thy
servant
also
from
presumptuous
sins
let
them
not
have
dominion
over
me
then
shall
i
be
upright
and
i
shall
be
innocent
from
the
great
transgression
19
14
let
the
words
of
my
mouth
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart
be
acceptable
in
thy
sight
o
lord
my
strength
and
my
redeemer
20
1
the
lord

thee
in
the
day
of
trouble

name
of
the
god
of
jacob
defend
thee
20
2
send
thee
help
from
the
sanctuary
and
strengthen
thee
out
of
zion
20
3
remember
all
thy
offerings
and
accept
thy
burnt
sacrifice
selah
20
4
grant
thee
according
to
thine
own
heart
and
fulfil
all
thy
counsel
20
5
we
will
rejoice
in
thy
salvation
and
in
the
name
of
our
god
we
will
set
up
our
banners
the
lord
fulfil
all
thy
petitions
20
6
now
know
i
that
the
lord
saveth
his
anointed
he
will
hear
him
from
his
holy
heaven
with
the
saving
strength
of
his
right
hand
20
7
some
trust
in
chariots
and
some
in
horses
but
we
will
remember
the
name
of
the
lord
our
god
20
8
they
are
brought
down
and
fallen
but
we
are
risen
and
stand
upright
20
9
save
lord
let
the
king
hear
us
when
we
call
21
1
the
king
shall
joy
in
thy
strength
o
lord
and
in
thy
salvation
how
greatly
shall
he
rejoice
21
2
thou
hast
given
him
his
heart’s
desire
and
hast
not
withholden
the
request
of
his
lips
selah
21
3
for
thou
preventest
him
with
the
blessings
of
goodness
thou
settest
a
crown
of
pure
gold
on
his
head
21
4
he
asked
life
of
thee
and
thou
gavest
it
him
even
length
of
days
for
ever
and
ever
21
5
his
glory
is
great
in
thy
salvation
honour
and
majesty
hast
thou
laid
upon
him
21
6
for
thou
hast
made
him
most
blessed
for
ever
thou
hast
made
him
exceeding
glad
with
thy
countenance
21
7
for
the
king
trusteth
in
the
lord
and
through
the
mercy
of
the
most
high
he
shall
not
be
moved
21
8
thine
hand
shall
find
out
all
thine
enemies
thy
right
hand
shall
find
out
those
that
hate
thee
21
9
thou
shalt
make
them
as
a
fiery
oven
in
the
time
of
thine
anger
the
lord
shall
swallow
them
up
in
his
wrath
and
the
fire
shall
devour
them
21
10
their
fruit
shalt
thou
destroy
from
the
earth
and
their
seed
from
among
the
children
of
men
21
11
for
they
intended
evil
against
thee
they
imagined
a
mischievous
device
which
they
are
not
able
to
perform
21
12
therefore
shalt
thou
make
them
turn
their
back
when
thou
shalt
make
ready
thine
arrows
upon
thy
strings
against
the
face
of
them
21
13
be
thou
exalted
lord
in
thine
own
strength
so
will
we
sing
and
praise
thy
power
22
1
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
why
art
thou
so
far
from
helping
me
and
from
the
words
of
my
roaring
22
2
o
my
god
i
cry
in
the
day
time
but
thou
hearest
not
and
in
the
night
season
and
am
not
silent
22
3
but
thou
art
holy
o
thou
that
inhabitest
the
praises
of
israel
22
4
our
fathers
trusted
in
thee
they
trusted
and
thou
didst
deliver
them
22
5
they
cried
unto
thee
and
were
delivered
they
trusted
in
thee
and
were
not
confounded
22
6
but
i
am
a
worm
and
no
man
a
reproach
of
men
and
despised
of
the
people
22
7
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out
the
lip
they
shake
the
head
saying
22
8
he
trusted
on
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
let
him
deliver
him
seeing
he
delighted
in
him
22
9
but
thou
art
he
that
took
me
out
of
the
womb
thou
didst
make
me
hope
when
i
was
upon
my
mother’s
breasts
22
10
i
was
cast
upon
thee
from
the
womb
thou
art
my
god
from
my
mother’s
belly
22
11
be
not
far
from
me
for
trouble
is
near
for
there
is
none
to
help
22
12
many
bulls
have
compassed
me
strong
bulls
of
bashan
have
beset
me
round
22
13
they
gaped
upon
me
with
their
mouths
as
a
ravening
and
a
roaring
lion
22
14
i
am
poured
out
like
water
and
all
my
bones
are
out
of
joint
my
heart
is
like
wax
it
is
melted
in
the
midst
of
my
bowels
22
15
my
strength
is
dried
up
like
a
potsherd
and
my
tongue
cleaveth
to
my
jaws
and
thou
hast
brought
me
into
the
dust
of
death
22
16
for
dogs
have
compassed
me
the
assembly
of
the
wicked
have
inclosed
me
they
pierced
my
hands
and
my
feet
22
17
i
may
tell
all
my
bones
they
look
and
stare
upon
me
22
18
they
part
my
garments
among
them
and
cast
lots
upon
my
vesture
22
19
but
be
not
thou
far
from
me
o
lord
o
my
strength
haste
thee
to
help
me
22
20
deliver
my
soul
from
the
sword
my
darling
from
the
power
of
the
dog
22
21
save
me
from
the
lion’s
mouth
for
thou
hast
heard
me
from
the
horns
of
the
unicorns
22
22
i
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
brethren
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
will
i
praise
thee
22
23
ye
that
fear
the
lord
praise
him
all
ye
the
seed
of
jacob
glorify
him
and
fear
him
all
ye
the
seed
of
israel
22
24
for
he
hath
not
despised
nor
abhorred
the
affliction
of
the
afflicted
neither
hath
he
hid
his
face
from
him
but
when
he
cried
unto
him
he
heard
22
25
my
praise
shall
be
of
thee
in
the
great
congregation
i
will
pay
my
vows
before
them
that

him
22
26
the
meek
shall
eat
and
be
satisfied
they
shall
praise
the
lord
that

heart
shall
live
for
ever

the
ends
of
the
world

remember
and
turn
unto
the
lord
and
all
the
kindreds
of
the
nations
shall
worship
before
thee
22
28
for
the
kingdom
is
the
lord’s
and
he
is
the
governor
among
the
nations
22
29
all
they
that
be
fat
upon
earth
shall
eat
and
worship
all
they
that
go
down
to
the
dust
shall
bow
before
him
and
none
can
keep
alive
his
own
soul
22
30
a
seed
shall
serve
him
it
shall
be
accounted
to
the
lord
for
a
generation
22
31
they
shall
come
and
shall
declare
his
righteousness
unto
a
people
that
shall
be
born
that
he
hath
done
this
23
1
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
23
2
he
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures
he
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
waters
23
3
he
restoreth
my
soul
he
leadeth
me
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
for
his
name’s
sake
23
4
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
23
5
thou
preparest
a
table
before
me
in
the
presence
of
mine
enemies
thou
anointest
my
head
with
oil
my
cup
runneth
over
23
6
surely
goodness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
ever
24
1
the
earth

the
lord’s
and
the
fulness
thereof
the

holy
place
24

he
that

clean
hands
and
a
pure
heart
who
hath
not
lifted
up
his
soul
unto
vanity
nor

deceitfully
24

receive
the
blessing
from
the
lord

not
sit
with
the
wicked
26
6
i
will
wash
mine

in

my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
i
fear
the
lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
i
be
afraid
27
2
when
the
wicked
even
mine
enemies
and
my
foes
came
upon
me
to
eat
up
my
flesh
they
stumbled
and
fell
27
3
though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
my
heart
shall
not
fear
though
war
should
rise
against
me
in
this
will
i
be
confident
27
4
one
thing
have
i
desired
of
the
lord
that
will
i
seek
after
that
i
may
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
all
the
days
of
my
life
to
behold
the
beauty
of
the
lord
and
to
enquire
in
his
temple
27
5
for
in
the
time
of
trouble
he
shall
hide
me
in
his
pavilion
in
the
secret
of
his
tabernacle
shall
he
hide
me
he
shall
set
me
up
upon
a
rock
27
6
and
now
shall
mine
head
be
lifted
up
above
mine
enemies
round
about
me
therefore
will
i
offer
in
his
tabernacle
sacrifices
of
joy
i
will
sing
yea
i
will
sing
praises
unto
the
lord
27
7
hear
o
lord
when
i
cry
with
my
voice
have
mercy
also
upon
me
and
answer
me
27
8
when
thou
saidst
seek
ye
my
face
my
heart
said
unto
thee
thy
face
lord
will
i
seek
27
9
hide
not
thy
face
far
from
me
put
not
thy
servant
away
in
anger
thou
hast
been
my
help
leave
me
not
neither
forsake
me
o
god
of
my
salvation
27
10
when
my
father
and
my
mother
forsake
me
then
the
lord
will
take
me
up
27
11
teach
me
thy
way
o
lord
and
lead
me
in
a
plain
path
because
of
mine
enemies
27
12
deliver
me
not
over
unto
the
will
of
mine
enemies
for
false
witnesses
are
risen
up
against
me
and
such
as
breathe
out
cruelty
27
13
i
had
fainted
unless

had
believed
to
see
the
goodness
of
the
lord
in
the
land
of
the
living
27

unto
thee
will
i
cry
o

like
them
that

down
into
the
pit

of
my
supplications
when

unto
thee
when

up
my
hands
toward
thy
holy
oracle
28
3
draw
me
not
away
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
which
speak
peace
to
their
neighbours
but
mischief
is
in
their
hearts
28
4
give
them
according
to
their
deeds
and
according
to
the
wickedness
of
their
endeavours
give
them
after
the
work
of
their
hands
render
to
them
their
desert
28
5
because
they
regard
not
the
works
of
the
lord
nor
the
operation
of
his
hands
he
shall
destroy
them
and
not
build
them
up
28
6
blessed
be
the
lord
because
he
hath
heard
the
voice
of
my
supplications

my
strength
and
my
shield

heart
trusted
in
him

heart
greatly
rejoiceth
and

my
song

i
praise
him

31
10
for
my
life
is
spent
with
grief
and
my
years
with
sighing
my
strength
faileth
because
of
mine
iniquity
and
my
bones
are
consumed
31
11
i
was
a
reproach
among
all
mine
enemies
but
especially
among
my
neighbours
and
a
fear
to
mine
acquaintance
they
that
did
see
me
without
fled
from
me
31
12
i
am
forgotten
as
a
dead
man
out
of
mind
i
am
like
a
broken
vessel
31
13
for
i
have
heard
the
slander
of
many
fear
was
on
every
side
while
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
31
14
but
i
trusted
in
thee
o
lord

said
thou
art
my
god
31
15
my
times
are
in
thy
hand

me
from
the
hand
of
mine
enemies

thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
servant
save
me
for
thy
mercies’
sake
31
17
let
me
not
be
ashamed
o
lord
for
i
have
called
upon
thee
let
the
wicked
be
ashamed
and
let
them
be
silent
in
the
grave
31
18
let
the
lying
lips
be
put
to
silence
which
speak
grievous
things
proudly
and
contemptuously
against
the
righteous
31
19
oh
how
great
is
thy
goodness
which
thou
hast
laid
up
for
them
that
fear
thee
which
thou
hast
wrought
for
them
that
trust
in
thee
before
the
sons
of
men
31
20
thou
shalt
hide
them
in
the
secret
of
thy
presence
from
the
pride
of
man
thou
shalt
keep
them
secretly
in
a
pavilion
from
the
strife
of
tongues
31
21
blessed
be
the
lord
for
he
hath
shewed
me
his
marvellous
kindness
in
a
strong
city
31
22
for
i
said
in
my
haste
i
am
cut
off
from
before
thine
eyes
nevertheless
thou
heardest
the
voice
of
my
supplications
when
i
cried
unto
thee
31
23
o
love
the
lord
all
ye
his
saints
for
the
lord
preserveth
the
faithful
and
plentifully
rewardeth
the
proud
doer

of
good
courage

shall
strengthen
your
heart
all
ye
that

the
man
unto
whom
the
lord
imputeth
not
iniquity
and
in
whose
spirit
there
is
no
guile
32
3
when
i
kept
silence
my
bones
waxed
old
through
my
roaring
all
the
day
long
32
4
for
day
and
night
thy
hand
was
heavy
upon
me
my
moisture
is
turned
into
the
drought
of
summer
selah

i
acknowledge
my
sin
unto
thee

confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
sin

for
this
shall
every
one
that
is
godly
pray
unto
thee
in
a
time
when
thou
mayest
be
found
surely
in
the
floods
of
great
waters
they
shall
not
come
nigh
unto
him
32
7
thou
art
my
hiding
place
thou
shalt
preserve
me
from
trouble
thou
shalt
compass
me
about
with
songs
of
deliverance

i
will
instruct
thee
and
teach
thee
in
the
way
which
thou
shalt
go
i
will
guide
thee
with
mine
eye
32

be
ye
not
as
the
horse
or
as
the
mule
which

no
understanding
whose
mouth
must
be
held
in
with
bit
and
bridle
lest
they
come
near
unto
thee
32
10
many
sorrows
shall
be
to
the
wicked
but
he
that
trusteth
in
the
lord

shall
compass
him
about

the

his
own
inheritance
33
13
the
lord
looketh
from
heaven
he
beholdeth
all
the
sons
of
men
33
14
from
the
place
of
his
habitation
he
looketh
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
33
15
he
fashioneth
their
hearts
alike
he
considereth
all
their
works
33
16
there
is
no
king
saved
by
the
multitude
of
an
host
a
mighty
man
is
not
delivered
by
much
strength
33
17
an
horse
is
a
vain
thing
for
safety
neither
shall
he
deliver
any
by
his
great
strength
33
18
behold
the
eye
of
the
lord
is
upon
them
that
fear
him
upon
them
that
hope
in
his
mercy
33
19
to
deliver
their
soul
from
death
and
to
keep
them
alive
in
famine
33
20
our
soul
waiteth
for
the
lord
he
is
our
help
and
our
shield
33
21
for
our
heart
shall
rejoice
in
him
because
we
have
trusted
in
his
holy
name
33
22
let
thy
mercy
o
lord
be
upon
us
according
as
we
hope
in
thee
34
1
i
will
bless
the
lord
at
all
times
his
praise
shall
continually
be
in
my
mouth
34
2
my
soul
shall
make
her
boast
in
the
lord
the
humble
shall
hear
thereof
and
be
glad
34
3
o
magnify
the
lord
with
me
and
let
us
exalt
his
name
together
34
4
i
sought
the
lord
and
he
heard
me
and
delivered
me
from
all
my
fears
34
5
they
looked
unto
him
and
were
lightened
and
their
faces
were
not
ashamed
34
6
this
poor
man
cried
and
the
lord
heard
him
and
saved
him
out
of
all
his
troubles
34
7
the
angel
of
the
lord
encampeth
round
about
them
that
fear
him
and
delivereth
them
34
8
o
taste
and
see
that
the
lord
is
good
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
him
34
9
o
fear
the
lord
ye
his
saints
for
there
is
no
want
to
them
that
fear
him
34
10
the
young
lions
do
lack
and
suffer
hunger
but
they
that
seek
the
lord
shall
not
want
any
good
thing
34
11
come
ye
children
hearken
unto
me
i
will
teach
you
the
fear
of
the
lord
34
12
what
man
is
he
that
desireth
life
and
loveth
many
days
that
he
may
see
good
34
13
keep
thy
tongue
from
evil
and
thy
lips
from
speaking
guile
34
14
depart
from
evil
and
do
good
seek
peace
and
pursue
it
34
15
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
upon
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
cry
34
16
the
face
of
the
lord
is
against
them
that
do
evil
to
cut
off
the
remembrance
of
them
from
the
earth
34
17
the
righteous
cry
and
the
lord
heareth
and
delivereth
them
out
of
all
their
troubles
34
18
the
lord
is
nigh
unto
them
that
are
of
a
broken
heart
and
saveth
such
as
be
of
a
contrite
spirit
34
19
many
are
the
afflictions
of
the
righteous
but
the
lord
delivereth
him
out
of
them
all
34
20
he
keepeth
all
his
bones
not
one
of
them
is
broken
34
21
evil
shall
slay
the
wicked
and
they
that
hate
the
righteous
shall
be
desolate
34
22
the
lord
redeemeth
the
soul
of
his
servants
and
none
of
them
that
trust
in
him
shall
be
desolate
35
1
plead
my
cause
o
lord
with
them
that
strive
with
me
fight
against
them
that
fight
against
me
35
2
take
hold
of
shield
and
buckler
and
stand
up
for
mine
help
35
3
draw
out
also
the
spear
and
stop
the
way
against
them
that
persecute
me
say
unto
my
soul
i
am
thy
salvation
35
4
let
them
be
confounded
and
put
to
shame
that
seek
after
my
soul
let
them
be
turned
back
and
brought
to
confusion
that
devise
my
hurt
35
5
let
them
be
as
chaff
before
the
wind
and
let
the
angel
of
the
lord
chase
them
35
6
let
their
way
be
dark
and
slippery
and
let
the
angel
of
the
lord
persecute
them
35
7
for
without
cause
have
they
hid
for
me
their
net
in
a
pit
which
without
cause
they
have
digged
for
my
soul
35
8
let
destruction
come
upon
him
at
unawares
and
let
his
net
that
he
hath
hid
catch
himself
into
that
very
destruction
let
him
fall
35
9
and
my
soul
shall
be
joyful
in
the
lord
it
shall
rejoice
in
his
salvation
35
10
all
my
bones
shall
say
lord
who
is
like
unto
thee
which
deliverest
the
poor
from
him
that
is
too
strong
for
him
yea
the
poor
and
the
needy
from
him
that
spoileth
him
35
11
false
witnesses
did
rise
up
they
laid
to
my
charge
things
that
i
knew
not
35
12
they
rewarded
me
evil
for
good
to
the
spoiling
of
my
soul
35
13
but
as
for
me
when
they
were
sick
my
clothing
was
sackcloth
i
humbled
my
soul
with
fasting
and
my
prayer
returned
into
mine
own
bosom
35
14
i
behaved
myself
as
though
he
had
been
my
friend
or
brother
i
bowed
down
heavily
as
one
that
mourneth
for
his
mother
35
15
but
in
mine
adversity
they
rejoiced
and
gathered
themselves
together
yea
the
abjects
gathered
themselves
together
against
me
and
i
knew
it
not
they
did
tear
me
and
ceased
not
35
16
with
hypocritical
mockers
in
feasts
they
gnashed
upon
me
with
their
teeth
35
17
lord
how
long
wilt
thou
look
on
rescue
my
soul
from
their
destructions
my
darling
from
the
lions
35
18
i
will
give
thee
thanks
in
the
great
congregation
i
will
praise
thee
among
much
people
35
19
let
not
them
that
are
mine
enemies
wrongfully
rejoice
over
me
neither
let
them
wink
with
the
eye
that
hate
me
without
a
cause
35
20
for
they
speak
not
peace
but
they
devise
deceitful
matters
against
them
that
are
quiet
in
the
land
35
21
yea
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
against
me
and
said
aha
aha
our
eye
hath
seen
it
35
22
this
thou
hast
seen
o
lord
keep
not
silence
o
lord
be
not
far
from
me
35
23
stir
up
thyself
and
awake
to
my
judgment
even
unto
my
cause
my
god
and
my
lord
35
24
judge
me
o
lord
my
god
according
to
thy
righteousness
and
let
them
not
rejoice
over
me
35
25
let
them
not
say
in
their
hearts
ah
so
would
we
have
it
let
them
not
say
we
have
swallowed
him
up
35
26
let
them
be
ashamed
and
brought
to
confusion
together
that
rejoice
at
mine
hurt
let
them
be
clothed
with
shame
and
dishonour
that
magnify
themselves
against
me
35
27
let
them
shout
for
joy
and
be
glad
that
favour
my
righteous
cause
yea
let
them
say
continually
let
the
lord
be
magnified
which
hath
pleasure
in
the
prosperity
of
his
servant
35
28
and
my
tongue
shall
speak
of
thy
righteousness
and
of
thy
praise
all
the
day
long
36
1
the
transgression
of
the
wicked
saith
within
my
heart
that
there
is
no
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
36
2
for
he
flattereth
himself
in
his
own
eyes
until
his
iniquity
be
found
to
be
hateful
36
3
the
words
of
his
mouth
are
iniquity
and
deceit
he
hath
left
off
to
be
wise
and
to
do
good
36
4
he
deviseth
mischief
upon
his
bed
he
setteth
himself
in
a
way
that
is
not
good
he
abhorreth
not
evil
36
5
thy
mercy
o
lord
is
in
the
heavens
and
thy
faithfulness
reacheth
unto
the
clouds
36
6
thy
righteousness
is
like
the
great
mountains
thy
judgments
are
a
great
deep
o
lord
thou
preservest
man
and
beast
36
7
how
excellent
is
thy
lovingkindness
o
god
therefore
the
children
of
men
put
their
trust
under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
36
8
they
shall
be
abundantly
satisfied
with
the
fatness
of
thy
house
and
thou
shalt
make
them
drink
of
the
river
of
thy
pleasures
36
9
for
with
thee
is
the
fountain
of
life
in
thy
light
shall
we
see
light
36
10
o
continue
thy
lovingkindness
unto
them
that
know
thee
and
thy
righteousness
to
the
upright
in
heart
36
11
let
not
the
foot
of
pride
come
against
me
and
let
not
the
hand
of
the
wicked
remove
me
36
12
there
are
the
workers
of
iniquity
fallen
they
are
cast
down
and
shall
not
be
able
to
rise
37
1
fret
not
thyself
because
of
evildoers
neither
be
thou
envious
against
the
workers
of
iniquity
37
2
for
they
shall
soon
be
cut
down
like
the
grass
and
wither
as
the
green
herb
37
3
trust
in
the
lord
and
do
good
so
shalt
thou
dwell
in
the
land
and
verily
thou
shalt
be
fed
37
4
delight
thyself
also
in
the
lord
and
he
shall
give
thee
the
desires
of
thine
heart
37
5
commit
thy
way
unto
the
lord
trust
also
in
him
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
pass
37
6
and
he
shall
bring
forth
thy
righteousness
as
the
light
and
thy
judgment
as
the
noonday
37
7
rest
in
the
lord
and
wait
patiently
for
him
fret
not
thyself
because
of
him
who
prospereth
in
his
way
because
of
the
man
who
bringeth
wicked
devices
to
pass
37
8
cease
from
anger
and
forsake
wrath
fret
not
thyself
in
any
wise
to
do
evil
37
9
for
evildoers
shall
be
cut
off
but
those
that
wait
upon
the
lord
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
37
10
for
yet
a
little
while
and
the
wicked
shall
not
be
yea
thou
shalt
diligently
consider
his
place
and
it
shall
not
be
37
11
but
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
and
shall
delight
themselves
in
the
abundance
of
peace
37
12
the
wicked
plotteth
against
the
just
and
gnasheth
upon
him
with
his
teeth
37
13
the
lord
shall
laugh
at
him
for
he
seeth
that
his
day
is
coming
37
14
the
wicked
have
drawn
out
the
sword
and
have
bent
their
bow
to
cast
down
the
poor
and
needy
and
to
slay
such
as
be
of
upright
conversation
37
15
their
sword
shall
enter
into
their
own
heart
and
their
bows
shall
be
broken
37
16
a
little
that
a
righteous
man
hath
is
better
than
the
riches
of
many
wicked
37
17
for
the
arms
of
the
wicked
shall
be
broken
but
the
lord
upholdeth
the
righteous
37
18
the
lord
knoweth
the
days
of
the
upright
and
their
inheritance
shall
be
for
ever
37
19
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
in
the
evil
time
and
in
the
days
of
famine
they
shall
be
satisfied
37
20
but
the
wicked
shall
perish
and
the
enemies
of
the
lord
shall
be
as
the
fat
of
lambs
they
shall
consume
into
smoke
shall
they
consume
away
37
21
the
wicked
borroweth
and
payeth
not
again
but
the
righteous
sheweth
mercy
and
giveth
37
22
for
such
as
be
blessed
of
him
shall
inherit
the
earth
and
they
that
be
cursed
of
him
shall
be
cut
off
37
23
the
steps
of
a
good
man
are
ordered
by
the
lord
and
he
delighteth
in
his
way
37
24
though
he
fall
he
shall
not
be
utterly
cast
down
for
the
lord
upholdeth
him
with
his
hand
37
25
i
have
been
young
and
now
am
old
yet
have
i
not
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
bread
37
26
he
is
ever
merciful
and
lendeth
and
his
seed
is
blessed
37
27
depart
from
evil
and
do
good
and
dwell
for
evermore
37
28
for
the
lord
loveth
judgment
and
forsaketh
not
his
saints
they
are
preserved
for
ever
but
the
seed
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
37
29
the
righteous
shall
inherit
the
land
and
dwell
therein
for
ever
37
30
the
mouth
of
the
righteous
speaketh
wisdom
and
his
tongue
talketh
of
judgment
37
31
the
law
of
his
god
is
in
his
heart
none
of
his
steps
shall
slide
37
32
the
wicked
watcheth
the
righteous
and
seeketh
to
slay
him
37
33
the
lord
will
not
leave
him
in
his
hand
nor
condemn
him
when
he
is
judged
37
34
wait
on
the
lord
and
keep
his
way
and
he
shall
exalt
thee
to
inherit
the
land
when
the
wicked
are
cut
off
thou
shalt
see
it
37
35
i
have
seen
the
wicked
in
great
power
and
spreading
himself
like
a
green
bay
tree
37
36
yet
he
passed
away
and
lo
he
was
not
yea
i
sought
him
but
he
could
not
be
found
37
37
mark
the
perfect
man
and
behold
the
upright
for
the
end
of
that
man
is
peace
37
38
but
the
transgressors
shall
be
destroyed
together
the
end
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
37
39
but
the
salvation
of
the
righteous
is
of
the
lord
he
is
their
strength
in
the
time
of
trouble
37
40
and
the
lord
shall
help
them
and
deliver
them
he
shall
deliver
them
from
the
wicked
and
save
them
because
they
trust
in
him
38
1
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thy
wrath
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure
38
2
for
thine
arrows
stick
fast
in
me
and
thy
hand
presseth
me
sore
38
3
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
because
of
thine
anger
neither
is
there
any
rest
in
my
bones
because
of
my
sin
38
4
for
mine
iniquities
are
gone
over
mine
head
as
an
heavy
burden
they
are
too
heavy
for
me
38
5
my
wounds
stink
and
are
corrupt
because
of
my
foolishness
38
6
i
am
troubled
i
am
bowed
down
greatly
i
go
mourning
all
the
day
long
38
7
for
my
loins
are
filled
with
a
loathsome
disease
and
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
38
8
i
am
feeble
and
sore
broken
i
have
roared
by
reason
of
the
disquietness
of
my
heart
38
9
lord
all
my
desire
is
before
thee
and
my
groaning
is
not
hid
from
thee
38
10
my
heart
panteth
my
strength
faileth
me
as
for
the
light
of
mine
eyes
it
also
is
gone
from
me
38
11
my
lovers
and
my
friends
stand
aloof
from
my
sore
and
my
kinsmen
stand
afar
off
38
12
they
also
that
seek
after
my
life
lay
snares
for
me
and
they
that
seek
my
hurt
speak
mischievous
things
and
imagine
deceits
all
the
day
long
38
13
but
i
as
a
deaf
man
heard
not
and
i
was
as
a
dumb
man
that
openeth
not
his
mouth
38
14
thus
i
was
as
a
man
that
heareth
not
and
in
whose
mouth
are
no
reproofs
38
15
for
in
thee
o
lord
do
i
hope
thou
wilt
hear
o
lord
my
god
38
16
for
i
said
hear
me
lest
otherwise
they
should
rejoice
over
me
when
my
foot
slippeth
they
magnify
themselves
against
me
38
17
for
i
am
ready
to
halt
and
my
sorrow
is
continually
before
me
38
18
for
i
will
declare
mine
iniquity
i
will
be
sorry
for
my
sin
38
19
but
mine
enemies
are
lively
and
they
are
strong
and
they
that
hate
me
wrongfully
are
multiplied
38
20
they
also
that
render
evil
for
good
are
mine
adversaries
because
i
follow
the
thing
that
good
is
38
21
forsake
me
not
o
lord
o
my
god
be
not
far
from
me
38
22
make
haste
to
help
me
o
lord
my
salvation
39
1
i
said
i
will
take
heed
to
my
ways
that
i
sin
not
with
my
tongue
i
will
keep
my
mouth
with
a
bridle
while
the
wicked
is
before
me
39
2
i
was
dumb
with
silence
i
held
my
peace
even
from
good
and
my
sorrow
was
stirred
39
3
my
heart
was
hot
within
me
while
i
was
musing
the
fire
burned
then
spake
i
with
my
tongue
39
4
lord
make
me
to
know
mine
end
and
the
measure
of
my
days
what
it
is
that
i
may
know
how
frail
i
am
39
5
behold
thou
hast
made
my
days
as
an
handbreadth
and
mine
age
is
as
nothing
before
thee
verily
every
man
at
his
best
state
is
altogether
vanity
selah
39
6
surely
every
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shew
surely
they
are
disquieted
in
vain
he
heapeth
up
riches
and
knoweth
not
who
shall
gather
them
39
7
and
now
lord
what
wait
i
for
my
hope
is
in
thee
39
8
deliver
me
from
all
my
transgressions
make
me
not
the
reproach
of
the
foolish
39
9
i
was
dumb
i
opened
not
my
mouth
because
thou
didst
it
39
10
remove
thy
stroke
away
from
me
i
am
consumed
by
the
blow
of
thine
hand
39
11
when
thou
with
rebukes
dost
correct
man
for
iniquity
thou
makest
his
beauty
to
consume
away
like
a
moth
surely
every
man
is
vanity
selah
39
12
hear
my
prayer
o
lord
and
give
ear
unto
my
cry
hold
not
thy
peace
at
my
tears
for
i
am
a
stranger
with
thee
and
a
sojourner
as
all
my
fathers
were
39
13
o
spare
me
that
i
may
recover
strength
before
i
go
hence
and
be
no
more
40
1
i
waited
patiently
for
the
lord
and
he
inclined
unto
me
and
heard
my
cry
40
2
he
brought
me
up
also
out
of
an
horrible
pit
out
of
the
miry
clay
and
set
my
feet
upon
a
rock
and
established
my
goings
40
3
and
he
hath
put
a
new
song
in
my
mouth
even
praise
unto
our
god
many
shall
see
it
and
fear
and
shall
trust
in
the
lord
40
4
blessed
is
that
man
that
maketh
the
lord
his
trust
and
respecteth
not
the
proud
nor
such
as
turn
aside
to
lies
40
5
many
o
lord
my
god
are
thy
wonderful
works
which
thou
hast
done
and
thy
thoughts
which
are
to
us-ward
they
cannot
be
reckoned
up
in
order
unto
thee
if
i
would
declare
and
speak
of
them
they
are
more
than
can
be
numbered
40
6
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
didst
not
desire
mine
ears
hast
thou
opened
burnt
offering
and
sin
offering
hast
thou
not
required
40
7
then
said
i
lo
i
come
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
40
8
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
o
my
god
yea
thy
law
is
within
my
heart
40
9
i
have
preached
righteousness
in
the
great
congregation
lo
i
have
not
refrained
my
lips
o
lord
thou
knowest
40
10
i
have
not
hid
thy
righteousness
within
my
heart
i
have
declared
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
salvation
i
have
not
concealed
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
from
the
great
congregation
40
11
withhold
not
thou
thy
tender
mercies
from
me
o
lord
let
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
continually
preserve
me
40
12
for
innumerable
evils
have
compassed
me
about
mine
iniquities
have
taken
hold
upon
me
so
that
i
am
not
able
to
look
up
they
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head
therefore
my
heart
faileth
me
40
13
be
pleased
o
lord
to
deliver
me
o
lord
make
haste
to
help
me
40
14
let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
together
that
seek
after
my
soul
to
destroy
it
let
them
be
driven
backward
and
put
to
shame
that
wish
me
evil
40
15
let
them
be
desolate
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
unto
me
aha
aha
40
16
let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually
the
lord
be
magnified
40
17
but
i
am
poor
and
needy
yet
the
lord
thinketh
upon
me
thou
art
my
help
and
my
deliverer
make
no
tarrying
o
my
god
41
1
blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
poor
the
lord
will
deliver
him
in
time
of
trouble
41
2
the
lord
will
preserve
him
and
keep
him
alive
and
he
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
earth
and
thou
wilt
not
deliver
him
unto
the
will
of
his
enemies
41
3
the
lord
will
strengthen
him
upon
the
bed
of
languishing
thou
wilt
make
all
his
bed
in
his
sickness
41
4
i
said
lord
be
merciful
unto
me
heal
my
soul
for
i
have
sinned
against
thee
41
5
mine
enemies
speak
evil
of
me
when
shall
he
die
and
his
name
perish
41
6
and
if
he
come
to
see
me
he
speaketh
vanity
his
heart
gathereth
iniquity
to
itself
when
he
goeth
abroad
he
telleth
it
41
7
all
that
hate
me
whisper
together
against
me
against
me
do
they
devise
my
hurt
41
8
an
evil
disease
say
they
cleaveth
fast
unto
him
and
now
that
he
lieth
he
shall
rise
up
no
more
41
9
yea
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
41
10
but
thou
o
lord
be
merciful
unto
me
and
raise
me
up
that
i
may
requite
them
41
11
by
this
i
know
that
thou
favourest
me
because
mine
enemy
doth
not
triumph
over
me
41
12
and
as
for
me
thou
upholdest
me
in
mine
integrity
and
settest
me
before
thy
face
for
ever
41
13
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
from
everlasting
and
to
everlasting
amen
and
amen
42
1
as
the
hart
panteth
after
the
water
brooks
so
panteth
my
soul
after
thee
o
god
42
2
my
soul
thirsteth
for
god
for
the
living
god
when
shall
i
come
and
appear
before
god
42
3
my
tears
have
been
my
meat
day
and
night
while
they
continually
say
unto
me
where
is
thy
god
42
4
when
i
remember
these
things
i
pour
out
my
soul
in
me
for
i
had
gone
with
the
multitude
i
went
with
them
to
the
house
of
god
with
the
voice
of
joy
and
praise
with
a
multitude
that
kept
holyday
42
5
why
art
thou
cast
down
o
my
soul
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
in
me
hope
thou
in
god
for
i
shall
yet
praise
him
for
the
help
of
his
countenance
42
6
o
my
god
my
soul
is
cast
down
within
me
therefore
will
i
remember
thee
from
the
land
of
jordan
and
of
the
hermonites
from
the
hill
mizar
42
7
deep
calleth
unto
deep
at
the
noise
of
thy
waterspouts
all
thy
waves
and
thy
billows
are
gone
over
me
42
8
yet
the
lord
will
command
his
lovingkindness
in
the
day
time
and
in
the
night
his
song
shall
be
with
me
and
my
prayer
unto
the
god
of
my
life
42
9
i
will
say
unto
god
my
rock
why
hast
thou
forgotten
me
why
go
i
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
enemy
42
10
as
with
a
sword
in
my
bones
mine
enemies
reproach
me
while
they
say
daily
unto
me
where
is
thy
god
42
11
why
art
thou
cast
down
o
my
soul
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
me
hope
thou
in
god
for
i
shall
yet
praise
him
who
is
the
health
of
my
countenance
and
my
god
43
1
judge
me
o
god
and
plead
my
cause
against
an
ungodly
nation
o
deliver
me
from
the
deceitful
and
unjust
man
43
2
for
thou
art
the
god
of
my
strength
why
dost
thou
cast
me
off
why
go
i
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
enemy
43
3
o
send
out
thy
light
and
thy
truth
let
them
lead
me
let
them
bring
me
unto
thy
holy
hill
and
to
thy
tabernacles
43
4
then
will
i
go
unto
the
altar
of
god
unto
god
my
exceeding
joy
yea
upon
the
harp
will
i
praise
thee
o
god
my
god
43
5
why
art
thou
cast
down
o
my
soul
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
me
hope
in
god
for
i
shall
yet
praise
him
who
is
the
health
of
my
countenance
and
my
god
44
1
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
o
god
our
fathers
have
told
us
what
work
thou
didst
in
their
days
in
the
times
of
old
44
2
how
thou
didst
drive
out
the
heathen
with
thy
hand
and
plantedst
them
how
thou
didst
afflict
the
people
and
cast
them
out
44
3
for
they
got
not
the
land
in
possession
by
their
own
sword
neither
did
their
own
arm
save
them
but
thy
right
hand
and
thine
arm
and
the
light
of
thy
countenance
because
thou
hadst
a
favour
unto
them
44
4
thou
art
my
king
o
god
command
deliverances
for
jacob
44
5
through
thee
will
we
push
down
our
enemies
through
thy
name
will
we
tread
them
under
that
rise
up
against
us
44
6
for
i
will
not
trust
in
my
bow
neither
shall
my
sword
save
me
44
7
but
thou
hast
saved
us
from
our
enemies
and
hast
put
them
to
shame
that
hated
us
44
8
in
god
we
boast
all
the
day
long
and
praise
thy
name
for
ever
selah
44
9
but
thou
hast
cast
off
and
put
us
to
shame
and
goest
not
forth
with
our
armies
44
10
thou
makest
us
to
turn
back
from
the
enemy
and
they
which
hate
us
spoil
for
themselves
44
11
thou
hast
given
us
like
sheep
appointed
for
meat
and
hast
scattered
us
among
the
heathen
44
12
thou
sellest
thy
people
for
nought
and
dost
not
increase
thy
wealth
by
their
price
44
13
thou
makest
us
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours
a
scorn
and
a
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us
44
14
thou
makest
us
a
byword
among
the
heathen
a
shaking
of
the
head
among
the
people
44
15
my
confusion
is
continually
before
me
and
the
shame
of
my
face
hath
covered
me
44
16
for
the
voice
of
him
that
reproacheth
and
blasphemeth
by
reason
of
the
enemy
and
avenger
44
17
all
this
is
come
upon
us
yet
have
we
not
forgotten
thee
neither
have
we
dealt
falsely
in
thy
covenant
44
18
our
heart
is
not
turned
back
neither
have
our
steps
declined
from
thy
way
44
19
though
thou
hast
sore
broken
us
in
the
place
of
dragons
and
covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
death
44
20
if
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our
god
or
stretched
out
our
hands
to
a
strange
god
44
21
shall
not
god
search
this
out
for
he
knoweth
the
secrets
of
the
heart
44
22
yea
for
thy
sake
are
we
killed
all
the
day
long
we
are
counted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
44
23
awake
why
sleepest
thou
o
lord
arise
cast
us
not
off
for
ever
44
24
wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face
and
forgettest
our
affliction
and
our
oppression
44
25
for
our
soul
is
bowed
down
to
the
dust
our
belly
cleaveth
unto
the
earth
44
26
arise
for
our
help
and
redeem
us
for
thy
mercies’
sake
45
1
my
heart
is
inditing
a
good
matter
i
speak
of
the
things
which
i
have
made
touching
the
king
my
tongue
is
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer
45
2
thou
art
fairer
than
the
children
of
men
grace
is
poured
into
thy
lips
therefore
god
hath
blessed
thee
for
ever
45
3
gird
thy
sword
upon
thy
thigh
o
most
mighty
with
thy
glory
and
thy
majesty
45
4
and
in
thy
majesty
ride
prosperously
because
of
truth
and
meekness
and
righteousness
and
thy
right
hand
shall
teach
thee
terrible
things
45
5
thine
arrows
are
sharp
in
the
heart
of
the
king’s
enemies
whereby
the
people
fall
under
thee
45
6
thy
throne
o
god
is
for
ever
and
ever
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
is
a
right
sceptre
45
7
thou
lovest
righteousness
and
hatest
wickedness
therefore
god
thy
god
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows
45
8
all
thy
garments
smell
of
myrrh
and
aloes
and
cassia
out
of
the
ivory
palaces
whereby
they
have
made
thee
glad
45
9
kings’
daughters

among
thy
honourable
women

him
45

consider

that
ye
may
tell
it
to
the

for
this
god
is
our
god
for

he
will
be

hear
this
all
ye

all
ye
inhabitants
of

49

both
low
and
high
rich
and
poor
together
49
3
my
mouth
shall
speak
of
wisdom
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart
shall
be
of
understanding
49
4
i
will
incline
mine
ear
to
a
parable
i
will
open
my
dark
saying
upon
the
harp
49
5
wherefore
should
i
fear
in
the
days
of
evil
when
the
iniquity
of
my
heels
shall
compass
me
about
49
6
they
that
trust
in
their
wealth
and
boast
themselves
in
the
multitude
of
their
riches
49
7
none
of
them
can
by
any
means
redeem
his
brother
nor
give
to
god
a
ransom
for
him
49
8
(for
the
redemption
of
their
soul
is
precious
and
it
ceaseth
for
ever
)
49
9
that
he
should
still
live
for
ever
and
not
see
corruption
49
10
for
he
seeth
that
wise
men
die
likewise
the
fool
and
the
brutish
person
perish
and
leave
their
wealth
to
others
49
11
their
inward
thought
is
that
their
houses
shall
continue
for
ever
and
their
dwelling
places
to
all
generations
they
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names
49
12
nevertheless
man
being
in
honour
abideth
not
he
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish
49
13
this
their
way
is
their
folly
yet
their
posterity
approve
their
sayings
selah
49
14
like
sheep
they
are
laid
in
the
grave
death
shall
feed
on
them
and
the
upright
shall
have
dominion
over
them
in
the
morning
and
their
beauty
shall
consume
in
the
grave
from
their
dwelling
49
15
but
god
will
redeem
my
soul
from
the
power
of
the
grave
for
he
shall
receive
me
selah
49
16
be
not
thou
afraid
when
one
is
made
rich
when
the
glory
of
his
house
is
increased
49
17
for
when
he
dieth
he
shall
carry
nothing
away
his
glory
shall
not
descend
after
him
49
18
though
while
he
lived
he
blessed
his
soul
and
men
will
praise
thee
when
thou
doest
well
to
thyself
49
19
he
shall
go
to
the
generation
of
his
fathers
they
shall
never
see
light

the

out

the

our

a

shall
devour
before

it
shall

very
tempestuous
round
about

he
shall
call
to

gather

together
unto
me
those
that

hear
o
my
people
and
i
will
speak
o
israel
and
i
will
testify
against
thee
i
am
god
even
thy
god
50
8
i
will
not
reprove
thee
for
thy
sacrifices
or
thy
burnt
offerings
to
have
been
continually
before
me
50
9
i
will
take
no
bullock
out
of
thy
house
nor
he
goats
out
of
thy
folds
50
10
for
every
beast
of
the
forest
is
mine
and
the
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
50
11
i
know
all
the
fowls
of
the
mountains
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
are
mine
50
12
if
i
were
hungry
i
would
not
tell
thee
for
the
world
is
mine
and
the
fulness
thereof
50
13
will
i
eat
the
flesh
of
bulls
or
drink
the
blood
of
goats
50
14
offer
unto
god
thanksgiving
and
pay
thy
vows
unto
the
most
high
50
15
and
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
50
16
but
unto
the
wicked
god
saith
what
hast
thou
to
do
to
declare
my
statutes
or
that
thou
shouldest
take
my
covenant
in
thy
mouth
50
17
seeing
thou
hatest
instruction
and
casteth
my
words
behind
thee
50
18
when
thou
sawest
a
thief
then
thou
consentedst
with
him
and
hast
been
partaker
with
adulterers
50
19
thou
givest
thy
mouth
to
evil
and
thy
tongue
frameth
deceit
50
20
thou
sittest
and
speakest
against
thy
brother
thou
slanderest
thine
own
mother’s
son
50
21
these
things
hast
thou
done
and
i
kept
silence
thou
thoughtest
that
i
was
altogether
such
an
one
as
thyself
but
i
will
reprove
thee
and
set
them
in
order
before
thine
eyes
50
22
now
consider
this
ye
that
forget
god
lest
i
tear
you
in
pieces
and
there
be
none
to
deliver
50
23
whoso
offereth
praise
glorifieth
me
and
to
him
that
ordereth
his
conversation
aright
will
i
shew
the
salvation
of
god
51
1
have
mercy
upon
me
o
god
according
to
thy
lovingkindness
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
transgressions
51
2
wash
me
throughly
from
mine
iniquity
and
cleanse
me
from
my
sin
51
3
for
i
acknowledge
my
transgressions
and
my
sin
is
ever
before
me
51
4
against
thee
thee
only
have
i
sinned
and
done
this
evil
in
thy
sight
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
when
thou
speakest
and
be
clear
when
thou
judgest
51
5
behold
i
was
shapen
in
iniquity
and
in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
me
51
6
behold
thou
desirest
truth
in
the
inward
parts
and
in
the
hidden
part
thou
shalt
make
me
to
know
wisdom
51
7
purge
me
with
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
clean
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
whiter
than
snow
51
8
make
me
to
hear
joy
and
gladness
that
the
bones
which
thou
hast
broken
may
rejoice
51
9
hide
thy
face
from
my
sins
and
blot
out
all
mine
iniquities
51
10
create
in
me
a
clean
heart
o
god
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me
51
11
cast
me
not
away
from
thy
presence
and
take
not
thy
holy
spirit
from
me
51
12
restore
unto
me
the
joy
of
thy
salvation
and
uphold
me
with
thy
free
spirit
51
13
then
will
i
teach
transgressors
thy
ways
and
sinners
shall
be
converted
unto
thee
51
14
deliver
me
from
bloodguiltiness
o
god
thou
god
of
my
salvation
and
my
tongue
shall
sing
aloud
of
thy
righteousness
51
15
o
lord
open
thou
my
lips
and
my
mouth
shall
shew
forth
thy
praise
51
16
for
thou
desirest
not
sacrifice
else
would
i
give
it
thou
delightest
not
in
burnt
offering
51
17
the
sacrifices
of
god
are
a
broken
spirit
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart
o
god
thou
wilt
not
despise
51
18
do
good
in
thy
good
pleasure
unto
zion
build
thou
the
walls
of
jerusalem
51
19
then
shalt
thou
be
pleased
with
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
with
burnt
offering
and
whole
burnt
offering
then
shall
they
offer
bullocks
upon
thine
altar
52
1
why
boastest
thou
thyself
in
mischief
o
mighty
man
the
goodness
of
god
endureth
continually
52
2
the
tongue
deviseth
mischiefs
like
a
sharp
razor
working
deceitfully
52
3
thou
lovest
evil
more
than
good
and
lying
rather
than
to
speak
righteousness
selah
52
4
thou
lovest
all
devouring
words
o
thou
deceitful
tongue
52
5
god
shall
likewise
destroy
thee
for
ever
he
shall
take
thee
away
and
pluck
thee
out
of
thy
dwelling
place
and
root
thee
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
selah
52
6
the
righteous
also
shall
see
and
fear
and
shall
laugh
at
him
52
7
lo
this
is
the
man
that
made
not
god
his
strength
but
trusted
in
the
abundance
of
his
riches
and
strengthened
himself
in
his
wickedness
52
8
but
i
am
like
a
green
olive
tree
in
the
house
of
god
i
trust
in
the
mercy
of
god
for
ever
and
ever
52
9
i
will
praise
thee
for
ever
because
thou
hast
done
it
and
i
will
wait
on
thy
name
for
it
is
good
before
thy
saints
53
1
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
corrupt
are
they
and
have
done
abominable
iniquity
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
53
2
god
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
the
children
of
men
to
see
if
there
were
any
that
did
understand
that
did
seek
god
53
3
every
one
of
them
is
gone
back
they
are
altogether
become
filthy
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
53
4
have
the
workers
of
iniquity
no
knowledge
who
eat
up
my
people
as
they
eat
bread
they
have
not
called
upon
god
53
5
there
were
they
in
great
fear
where
no
fear
was
for
god
hath
scattered
the
bones
of
him
that
encampeth
against
thee
thou
hast
put
them
to
shame
because
god
hath
despised
them
53

oh
that
the
salvation
of
israel
were
come
out
of
zion
when
god
bringeth
back
the
captivity
of
his
people
jacob
shall
rejoice
and
israel
shall
be
glad
54

save
me
o
god
by
thy
name
and
judge
me
by
thy
strength
54
2
hear
my
prayer
o
god
give
ear
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
54
3
for
strangers
are
risen
up
against
me
and
oppressors
seek
after
my
soul
they
have
not
set
god
before
them
selah
54
4
behold
god
is
mine
helper
the
lord
is
with
them
that
uphold
my
soul
54
5
he
shall
reward
evil
unto
mine
enemies
cut
them
off
in
thy
truth
54
6
i
will
freely
sacrifice
unto
thee
i
will
praise
thy
name
o
lord
for
it
is
good
54
7
for
he
hath
delivered
me
out
of
all
trouble
and
mine
eye
hath
seen
his
desire
upon
mine
enemies
55
1
give
ear
to
my
prayer
o
god
and
hide
not
thyself
from
my
supplication
55
2
attend
unto
me
and
hear
me
i
mourn
in
my
complaint
and
make
a
noise
55
3
because
of
the
voice
of
the
enemy
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
wicked
for
they
cast
iniquity
upon
me
and
in
wrath
they
hate
me
55
4
my
heart
is
sore
pained
within
me
and
the
terrors
of
death
are
fallen
upon
me
55
5
fearfulness
and
trembling
are
come
upon
me
and
horror
hath
overwhelmed
me
55
6
and
i
said
oh
that
i
had
wings
like
a
dove
for
then
would
i
fly
away
and
be
at
rest
55
7
lo
then
would
i
wander
far
off
and
remain
in
the
wilderness
selah
55
8
i
would
hasten
my
escape
from
the
windy
storm
and
tempest
55
9
destroy
o
lord
and
divide
their
tongues
for
i
have
seen
violence
and
strife
in
the
city
55
10
day
and
night
they
go
about
it
upon
the
walls
thereof
mischief
also
and
sorrow
are
in
the
midst
of
it
55
11
wickedness
is
in
the
midst
thereof
deceit
and
guile
depart
not
from
her
streets
55
12
for
it
was
not
an
enemy
that
reproached
me
then
i
could
have
borne
it
neither
was
it
he
that
hated
me
that
did
magnify
himself
against
me
then
i
would
have
hid
myself
from
him
55
13
but
it
was
thou
a
man
mine
equal
my
guide
and
mine
acquaintance
55
14
we
took
sweet
counsel
together
and
walked
unto
the
house
of
god
in
company
55
15
let
death
seize
upon
them
and
let
them
go
down
quick
into
hell
for
wickedness
is
in
their
dwellings
and
among
them
55
16
as
for
me
i
will
call
upon
god
and
the
lord
shall
save
me
55
17
evening
and
morning
and
at
noon
will
i
pray
and
cry
aloud
and
he
shall
hear
my
voice
55
18
he
hath
delivered
my
soul
in
peace
from
the
battle
that
was
against
me
for
there
were
many
with
me
55
19
god
shall
hear
and
afflict
them
even
he
that
abideth
of
old
selah
because
they
have
no
changes
therefore
they
fear
not
god
55
20
he
hath
put
forth
his
hands
against
such
as
be
at
peace
with
him
he
hath
broken
his
covenant
55
21
the
words
of
his
mouth
were
smoother
than
butter
but
war

speaking

their
poison
is
like
the
poison
of

serpent
they
are
like
the
deaf
adder
that

58
7
let
them
melt
away
as
waters
which
run
continually
when
he
bendeth
his
bow
to
shoot
his
arrows
let
them
be
as
cut
in
pieces
58
8
as
a
snail
which
melteth
let
every
one
of
them
pass
away
like
the
untimely
birth
of
a
woman
that
they
may
not
see
the

58
9
before
your
pots
can
feel
the
thorns
he

take
them
away
as
with
a
whirlwind
both
living

in
his
wrath
58
10
the
righteous

rejoice
when
he
seeth
the
vengeance
he
shall
wash
his
feet
in
the
blood
of
the
wicked
58
11
so
that
a
man
shall
say
verily
there

and
lying
which
they

consume
them
in

consume
them
that
they

know
that
god
ruleth
in
jacob
unto
the
ends

wander
up

when

me
to
the
rock

i
will
abide
in

for
ever
o
prepare
mercy
and
truth
which
may
preserve

61
8
so
will
i
sing
praise
unto
thy
name
for
ever
that
i
may
daily
perform
my
vows
62
1
truly
my
soul
waiteth
upon
god
from
him
cometh
my
salvation
62
2
he
only
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation

is
my
defence
i
shall
not
be
greatly
moved
62
3
how
long
will
ye
imagine
mischief
against
a
man
ye
shall
be
slain
all
of
you
as
a
bowing
wall
shall
ye
be
and
as
a
tottering
fence
62
4
they
only
consult
to
cast
him
down
from
his
excellency
they
delight
in
lies
they
bless
with
their
mouth

they
curse
inwardly
selah
62

pour
out
your
heart
before
him
god
is
a
refuge
for
us
selah
62
9
surely
men
of
low
degree
are
vanity
and
men
of
high
degree
are
a
lie
to
be
laid
in
the
balance
they
are
altogether
lighter
than
vanity
62
10
trust
not
in
oppression
and
become
not
vain
in
robbery
if
riches
increase
set
not
your
heart
upon

62
11
god

heard
this
that

12
also
unto
thee
o

belongeth
mercy
for
thou
renderest
to
every
man
according
to
his
work
63
1
o
god
thou
art
my
god
early
will
i
seek
thee
my
soul
thirsteth
for
thee
my
flesh
longeth
for
thee
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
land
where
no
water
is
63
2
to
see
thy
power
and
thy
glory
so
as
i
have
seen
thee
in
the
sanctuary
63
3
because
thy
lovingkindness
is
better
than
life
my
lips
shall
praise
thee
63
4
thus
will
i
bless
thee
while
i
live
i
will
lift
up
my
hands
in
thy
name
63
5
my
soul
shall
be
satisfied
as
with
marrow
and
fatness
and
my
mouth
shall
praise
thee
with
joyful
lips
63
6
when
i
remember
thee
upon
my
bed
and
meditate
on
thee
in
the
night
watches
63
7
because
thou
hast
been
my
help
therefore
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
i
rejoice
63
8
my
soul
followeth
hard
after
thee
thy
right
hand
upholdeth
me
63
9
but
those
that
seek
my
soul
to
destroy
it
shall
go
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
63
10
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
they
shall
be
a
portion
for
foxes
63
11
but
the
king
shall
rejoice
in
god
every
one
that
sweareth
by
him
shall
glory
but
the
mouth
of
them
that
speak
lies
shall
be
stopped
64
1
hear
my
voice
o
god
in
my
prayer
preserve
my
life
from
fear
of
the
enemy
64
2
hide
me
from
the
secret
counsel
of
the
wicked
from
the
insurrection
of
the
workers
of
iniquity
64
3
who
whet
their
tongue
like
a
sword
and
bend
their
bows
to
shoot
their
arrows
even
bitter
words
64
4
that
they
may
shoot
in
secret
at
the
perfect
suddenly
do
they
shoot
at
him
and
fear
not
64
5
they
encourage
themselves
in
an
evil
matter
they
commune
of
laying
snares
privily
they
say
who
shall
see
them
64
6
they
search
out
iniquities
they
accomplish
a
diligent
search
both
the
inward
thought
of
every
one
of
them
and
the
heart
is
deep
64
7
but
god
shall
shoot
at
them
with
an
arrow
suddenly
shall
they
be
wounded
64
8
so
they
shall
make
their
own
tongue
to
fall
upon
themselves
all
that
see
them
shall
flee
away
64
9
and
all
men
shall
fear
and
shall
declare
the
work
of
god
for
they
shall
wisely
consider
of
his
doing
64
10
the
righteous
shall
be
glad
in
the
lord
and
shall
trust
in
him
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
glory
65

for
thee
o

and
unto
thee
shall
the
vow
be
performed
65
2
o
thou
that
hearest
prayer
unto
thee
shall
all
flesh
come
65
3
iniquities
prevail
against
me
as
for
our
transgressions
thou
shalt
purge
them
away
65
4
blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
choosest
and
causest
to
approach
unto
thee
that
he
may
dwell
in
thy
courts
we
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
goodness
of
thy
house
even
of
thy
holy
temple
65
5
by
terrible
things
in
righteousness
wilt
thou
answer
us
o
god
of
our
salvation
who
art
the
confidence
of
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
of
them
that
are
afar
off
upon
the
sea
65
6
which
by
his
strength
setteth
fast
the
mountains
being
girded
with
power
65
7
which
stilleth
the
noise
of
the
seas
the
noise
of
their
waves
and
the
tumult
of
the
people
65
8
they
also
that
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
are
afraid
at
thy
tokens
thou
makest
the
outgoings
of
the
morning
and
evening
to
rejoice
65
9
thou
visitest
the
earth
and
waterest
it
thou
greatly
enrichest
it
with
the
river
of
god
which
is
full
of
water
thou
preparest
them
corn
when
thou
hast
so
provided
for
it
65
10
thou
waterest
the
ridges
thereof
abundantly
thou
settlest
the
furrows
thereof
thou
makest
it
soft
with
showers
thou
blessest
the
springing
thereof
65
11
thou
crownest
the
year
with
thy
goodness
and
thy
paths
drop
fatness
65
12
they
drop
upon
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
and
the
little
hills
rejoice
on
every
side
65
13
the
pastures
are
clothed
with
flocks
the
valleys
also
are
covered
over
with
corn
they
shout
for
joy
they

thou
hast
caused

i
cried
unto

with
my
mouth
and
he
was
extolled
with
my
tongue
66
18
if

regard
iniquity
in

heart
the
lord

not
hear
me

o

when
thou
wentest
forth

people
when
thou
didst
march
through
the
wilderness
selah
68

the
earth
shook
the

the
god
of

thou
o

didst
send

didst
confirm
thine
inheritance
when

thy
congregation

prepared
of
thy
goodness
for
the

the

an
high
hill
as

16
why
leap

ye
high

this
is
the
hill
which
god
desireth
to
dwell
in
yea
the

will
dwell
in
it
for

68
17
the
chariots
of

twenty
thousand
even
thousands
of
angels
the
lord
is
among

as
in

holy
place
68
18
thou
hast
ascended
on
high
thou
hast
led

captive
thou
hast
received

scalp
of
such
an
one
as
goeth
on
still
in

of
thy
dogs
in
the
same
68
24
they

thy
goings
o

even
the
goings
of
my
god
my
king
in

69
1
save
me
o
god
for
the
waters
are
come
in
unto
my
soul
69
2
i
sink
in
deep
mire
where
there
is
no
standing
i
am
come
into
deep
waters
where
the
floods
overflow
me
69
3
i
am
weary
of
my
crying
my
throat
is
dried
mine
eyes
fail
while
i
wait
for
my
god
69
4
they
that
hate
me
without
a
cause
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head
they
that
would
destroy
me
being
mine
enemies
wrongfully
are
mighty
then
i
restored
that
which
i
took
not
away
69
5
o
god
thou
knowest
my
foolishness
and
my
sins
are
not
hid
from
thee
69
6
let
not
them
that
wait
on
thee
o
lord
god
of
hosts
be
ashamed
for
my
sake
let
not
those
that
seek
thee
be
confounded
for
my
sake
o
god
of
israel
69
7
because
for
thy
sake
i
have
borne
reproach
shame
hath
covered
my
face
69
8
i
am
become
a
stranger
unto
my
brethren
and
an
alien
unto
my
mother’s
children
69
9
for
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up
and
the
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
are
fallen
upon
me
69
10
when
i
wept
and
chastened
my
soul
with
fasting
that
was
to
my
reproach
69
11
i
made
sackcloth
also
my
garment
and
i
became
a
proverb
to
them
69
12
they
that
sit
in
the
gate
speak
against
me
and
i
was
the
song
of
the
drunkards
69
13
but
as
for
me
my
prayer
is
unto
thee
o
lord
in
an
acceptable
time
o
god
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
hear
me
in
the
truth
of
thy
salvation
69
14
deliver
me
out
of
the
mire
and
let
me
not
sink
let
me
be
delivered
from
them
that
hate
me
and
out
of
the
deep
waters
69
15
let
not
the
waterflood
overflow
me
neither
let
the
deep
swallow
me
up
and
let
not
the
pit
shut
her
mouth
upon
me
69
16
hear
me
o
lord
for
thy
lovingkindness
is
good
turn
unto
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
69
17
and
hide
not
thy
face
from
thy
servant
for
i
am
in
trouble
hear
me
speedily
69
18
draw
nigh
unto
my
soul
and
redeem
it
deliver
me
because
of
mine
enemies
69
19
thou
hast
known
my
reproach
and
my
shame
and
my
dishonour
mine
adversaries
are
all
before
thee
69
20
reproach
hath
broken
my
heart
and
i
am
full
of
heaviness
and
i
looked
for
some
to
take
pity
but
there
was
none
and
for
comforters
but
i
found
none
69
21
they
gave
me
also
gall
for
my
meat
and
in
my
thirst
they
gave
me
vinegar
to
drink
69
22
let
their
table
become
a
snare
before
them
and
that
which
should
have
been
for
their
welfare
let
it
become
a
trap
69
23
let
their
eyes
be
darkened
that
they
see
not
and
make
their
loins
continually
to
shake
69
24
pour
out
thine
indignation
upon
them
and
let
thy
wrathful
anger
take
hold
of
them
69
25
let
their
habitation
be
desolate
and
let
none
dwell
in
their
tents
69
26
for
they
persecute
him
whom
thou
hast
smitten
and
they
talk
to
the
grief
of
those
whom
thou
hast
wounded
69
27
add
iniquity
unto
their
iniquity
and
let
them
not
come
into
thy
righteousness
69
28
let
them
be
blotted
out
of
the
book
of
the
living
and
not
be
written
with
the
righteous
69
29
but
i
am
poor
and
sorrowful
let
thy
salvation
o
god
set
me
up
on
high
69
30
i
will
praise
the
name
of
god
with
a
song
and
will
magnify
him
with
thanksgiving
69
31
this
also
shall
please
the
lord
better
than
an
ox
or
bullock
that
hath
horns
and
hoofs
69
32
the
humble
shall
see
this
and
be
glad
and
your
heart
shall
live
that
seek
god
69
33
for
the
lord
heareth
the
poor
and
despiseth
not
his
prisoners
69
34
let
the
heaven
and
earth
praise
him
the
seas
and
every
thing
that
moveth
therein
69
35
for
god
will
save
zion
and
will
build
the
cities
of
judah
that
they
may
dwell
there
and
have
it
in
possession
69
36
the
seed
also
of
his
servants
shall
inherit
it
and
they
that
love
his
name
shall
dwell
therein
70
1
make
haste
o
god
to
deliver
me
make
haste
to
help
me
o
lord
70
2
let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
that
seek
after
my
soul
let
them
be
turned
backward
and
put
to
confusion
that
desire
my
hurt
70
3
let
them
be
turned
back
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
aha
aha
70
4
let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee
and
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually
let
god
be
magnified
70
5
but
i
am
poor
and
needy
make
haste
unto
me
o
god
thou
art
my
help
and
my
deliverer
o
lord
make
no
tarrying
71
1
in
thee
o
lord
do
i
put
my
trust
let
me
never
be
put
to
confusion
71
2
deliver
me
in
thy
righteousness
and
cause
me
to
escape
incline
thine
ear
unto
me
and
save
me
71
3
be
thou
my
strong
habitation
whereunto
i
may
continually
resort
thou
hast
given
commandment
to
save
me
for
thou
art
my
rock
and
my
fortress
71
4
deliver
me
o
my
god
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
out
of
the
hand
of
the
unrighteous
and
cruel
man
71
5
for
thou
art
my
hope
o
lord
god
thou
art
my
trust
from
my
youth
71
6
by
thee
have
i
been
holden
up
from
the
womb
thou
art
he
that
took
me
out
of
my
mother’s
bowels
my
praise
shall
be
continually
of
thee
71
7
i
am
as
a
wonder
unto
many
but
thou
art
my
strong
refuge
71
8
let
my
mouth
be
filled
with
thy
praise
and
with
thy
honour
all
the
day
71
9
cast
me
not
off
in
the
time
of
old
age
forsake
me
not
when
my
strength
faileth
71
10
for
mine
enemies
speak
against
me
and
they
that
lay
wait
for
my
soul
take
counsel
together
71
11
saying
god
hath
forsaken
him
persecute
and
take
him
for
there
is
none
to
deliver
him
71
12
o
god
be
not
far
from
me
o
my
god
make
haste
for
my
help
71
13
let
them
be
confounded
and
consumed
that
are
adversaries
to
my
soul
let
them
be
covered
with
reproach
and
dishonour
that

my
hurt
71
14
but
i
will
hope
continually
and
will
yet
praise
thee
more
and
more
71
15
my
mouth
shall
shew
forth
thy
righteousness
and
thy
salvation
all
the
day
for
i
know
not
the
numbers
thereof
71
16
i
will
go
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
god
i
will
make
mention
of
thy
righteousness
even
of
thine
only
71
17
o

hast
taught
me
from
my
youth
and
hitherto

power
to
every
one
that
is
to
come

done
great
things
o

who
is
like
unto
thee
71
20
thou
which
hast
shewed
me
great
and
sore
troubles
shalt
quicken
me
again
and
shalt
bring
me
up
again
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
71
21
thou
shalt
increase
my
greatness
and
comfort
me
on
every
side
71

also
praise
thee
with
the
psaltery

i
sing
with
the
harp
o
thou
holy
one
of
israel
71
23
my
lips
shall
greatly
rejoice
when
i
sing
unto
thee
and
my
soul
which
thou
hast
redeemed
71
24
my
tongue
also
shall
talk
of
thy
righteousness
all
the
day
long
for
they
are
confounded
for
they
are
brought
unto
shame
that
seek
my
hurt
72
1
give
the
king
thy
judgments
o
god
and
thy
righteousness
unto
the
king’s
son
72
2
he
shall
judge
thy
people
with
righteousness
and
thy
poor
with
judgment
72
3
the
mountains
shall
bring
peace
to
the
people
and
the
little
hills
by
righteousness
72
4
he
shall
judge
the
poor
of
the
people
he
shall
save
the
children
of
the
needy
and
shall
break
in
pieces
the
oppressor
72
5
they
shall
fear
thee
as
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
endure
throughout
all
generations
72
6
he
shall
come
down
like
rain
upon
the
mown
grass
as
showers
that
water
the
earth
72
7
in
his
days
shall
the
righteous
flourish
and
abundance
of
peace
so
long
as
the
moon
endureth
72
8
he
shall
have
dominion
also
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
river
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
72
9
they
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness
shall
bow
before
him
and
his
enemies
shall
lick
the
dust
72
10
the
kings
of
tarshish
and
of
the
isles
shall
bring
presents
the
kings
of
sheba
and
seba
shall
offer
gifts
72
11
yea
all
kings
shall
fall
down
before
him
all
nations
shall
serve
him
72
12
for
he
shall
deliver
the
needy
when
he
crieth
the
poor
also
and
him
that
hath
no
helper
72
13
he
shall
spare
the
poor
and
needy
and
shall
save
the
souls
of
the
needy
72
14
he
shall
redeem
their
soul
from
deceit
and
violence
and
precious
shall
their
blood
be
in
his
sight
72
15
and
he
shall
live
and
to
him
shall
be
given
of
the
gold
of
sheba
prayer
also
shall
be
made
for
him
continually
and
daily
shall
he
be
praised
72
16
there
shall
be
an
handful
of
corn
in
the
earth
upon
the
top
of
the
mountains
the
fruit
thereof
shall
shake
like
lebanon
and
they
of
the
city
shall
flourish
like
grass
of
the
earth
72
17
his
name
shall
endure
for
ever
his
name
shall
be
continued
as
long
as
the
sun
and
men
shall
be
blessed
in
him
all
nations
shall
call
him
blessed
72
18
blessed
be
the
lord
god
the
god
of
israel
who
only
doeth
wondrous
things
72
19
and
blessed
be
his
glorious
name
for
ever
and
let
the
whole
earth
be
filled
with
his
glory
amen
and
amen
72
20
the
prayers
of
david
the
son
of
jesse
are
ended
73
1
truly
god
is
good
to
israel
even
to
such
as
are
of
a
clean
heart
73
2
but
as
for
me
my
feet
were
almost
gone
my
steps
had
well
nigh
slipped
73
3
for
i
was
envious
at
the
foolish
when
i
saw
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
73
4
for
there
are
no
bands
in
their
death
but
their
strength
is
firm
73
5
they
are
not
in
trouble
as
other
men
neither
are
they
plagued
like
other
men
73
6
therefore
pride
compasseth
them
about
as
a
chain
violence
covereth
them
as
a
garment
73
7
their
eyes
stand
out
with
fatness
they
have
more
than
heart
could
wish
73
8
they
are
corrupt
and
speak
wickedly
concerning
oppression
they
speak
loftily
73
9
they
set
their
mouth
against
the
heavens
and
their
tongue
walketh
through
the
earth
73
10
therefore
his
people
return
hither
and
waters
of
a
full
cup
are
wrung
out
to
them
73
11
and
they
say
how
doth
god
know
and
is
there
knowledge
in
the
most
high
73
12
behold
these
are
the
ungodly
who
prosper
in
the
world
they
increase
in
riches
73
13
verily
i
have
cleansed
my
heart
in
vain
and
washed
my
hands
in
innocency
73
14
for
all
the
day
long
have
i
been
plagued
and
chastened
every
morning
73
15
if
i
say
i
will
speak
thus
behold
i
should
offend
against
the
generation
of
thy
children
73
16
when
i
thought
to
know
this
it
was
too
painful
for
me
73
17
until
i
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
god
then
understood
i
their
end
73
18
surely
thou
didst
set
them
in
slippery
places
thou
castedst
them
down
into
destruction
73
19
how
are
they
brought
into
desolation
as
in
a
moment
they
are
utterly
consumed
with
terrors
73
20
as
a
dream
when
one
awaketh
so
o
lord
when
thou
awakest
thou
shalt
despise
their
image
73
21
thus
my
heart
was
grieved
and
i
was
pricked
in
my
reins
73
22
so
foolish
was
i
and
ignorant
i
was
as
a
beast
before
thee
73
23
nevertheless
i
am
continually
with
thee
thou
hast
holden
me
by
my
right
hand
73
24
thou
shalt
guide
me
with
thy
counsel
and
afterward
receive
me
to
glory
73
25
whom
have
i
in
heaven
but
thee
and
there
is
none
upon
earth
that
i
desire
beside
thee
73
26
my
flesh
and
my
heart
faileth
but
god
is
the
strength
of
my
heart
and
my
portion
for
ever
73
27
for
lo
they
that
are
far
from
thee
shall
perish
thou
hast
destroyed
all
them
that
go
a
whoring
from
thee
73
28
but
it
is
good
for
me
to
draw
near
to
god
i
have
put
my
trust
in
the
lord
god
that
i
may
declare
all
thy
works
74
1
o
god
why
hast
thou
cast
us
off
for
ever
why
doth
thine
anger
smoke
against
the
sheep
of
thy
pasture
74
2
remember
thy
congregation
which
thou
hast
purchased
of
old
the
rod
of
thine
inheritance
which
thou
hast
redeemed
this
mount
zion
wherein
thou
hast
dwelt
74
3
lift
up
thy
feet
unto
the
perpetual
desolations
even
all
that
the
enemy
hath
done
wickedly
in
the
sanctuary
74
4
thine
enemies
roar
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations
they
set
up
their
ensigns
for
signs
74
5
a
man
was
famous
according
as
he
had
lifted
up
axes
upon
the
thick
trees
74
6
but
now
they
break
down
the
carved
work
thereof
at
once
with
axes
and
hammers
74
7
they
have
cast
fire
into
thy
sanctuary
they
have
defiled
by
casting
down
the
dwelling
place
of
thy
name
to
the
ground
74
8
they
said
in
their
hearts
let
us
destroy
them
together
they
have
burned
up
all
the
synagogues
of
god
in
the
land
74
9
we
see
not
our
signs
there
is
no
more
any
prophet
neither
is
there
among
us
any
that
knoweth
how
long
74
10
o
god
how
long
shall
the
adversary
reproach
shall
the
enemy
blaspheme
thy
name
for
ever
74
11
why
withdrawest
thou
thy
hand
even
thy
right
hand
pluck
it
out
of
thy
bosom
74
12
for
god
is
my
king
of
old
working
salvation
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
74
13
thou
didst
divide
the
sea
by
thy
strength
thou
brakest
the
heads
of
the
dragons
in
the
waters
74
14
thou
brakest
the
heads
of
leviathan
in
pieces
and
gavest
him
to
be
meat
to
the
people
inhabiting
the
wilderness
74
15
thou
didst
cleave
the
fountain
and
the
flood
thou
driedst
up
mighty
rivers
74
16
the
day
is
thine
the
night
also
is
thine
thou
hast
prepared
the
light
and
the
sun
74
17
thou
hast
set
all
the
borders
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
summer
and
winter
74
18
remember
this
that
the
enemy
hath
reproached
o
lord
and
that
the
foolish
people
have
blasphemed
thy
name
74
19
o
deliver
not
the
soul
of
thy
turtledove
unto
the
multitude
of
the
wicked
forget
not
the
congregation
of
thy
poor
for
ever
74
20
have
respect
unto
the
covenant
for
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
are
full
of
the
habitations
of
cruelty
74
21
o
let
not
the
oppressed
return
ashamed
let
the
poor
and
needy
praise
thy
name
74
22
arise
o
god
plead
thine
own
cause
remember
how
the
foolish
man
reproacheth
thee
daily
74
23
forget
not
the
voice
of
thine
enemies
the
tumult
of
those
that
rise
up
against
thee
increaseth
continually
75
1
unto
thee
o
god
do
we
give
thanks
unto
thee
do
we
give
thanks
for
that
thy
name
is
near
thy
wondrous
works
declare
75
2
when
i
shall
receive
the
congregation
i
will
judge
uprightly
75
3
the
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
dissolved
i
bear
up
the
pillars
of
it
selah
75
4
i
said
unto
the
fools
deal
not
foolishly
and
to
the
wicked
lift
not
up
the
horn
75
5
lift
not
up
your
horn
on
high
speak
not
with
a
stiff
neck
75
6
for
promotion
cometh
neither
from
the
east
nor
from
the
west
nor
from
the
south
75
7
but
god
is
the
judge
he
putteth
down
one
and
setteth
up
another
75
8
for
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
there
is
a
cup
and
the
wine
is
red
it
is
full
of
mixture
and
he
poureth
out
of
the
same
but
the
dregs
thereof
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
shall
wring
them
out
and
drink
them
75
9
but
i
will
declare
for
ever
i
will
sing
praises
to
the
god
of
jacob
75
10
all
the
horns
of
the
wicked
also
will
i
cut
off
but
the
horns
of
the
righteous
shall
be
exalted
76
1
in
judah
is
god
known
his
name
is
great
in
israel
76
2
in
salem
also
is
his
tabernacle
and
his
dwelling
place
in
zion
76
3
there
brake
he
the
arrows
of
the
bow
the
shield
and
the
sword
and
the
battle
selah
76
4
thou
art
more
glorious
and
excellent
than
the
mountains
of
prey
76
5
the
stouthearted
are
spoiled
they
have
slept
their
sleep
and
none
of
the
men
of
might
have
found
their
hands
76
6
at
thy
rebuke
o
god
of
jacob
both
the
chariot
and
horse
are
cast
into
a
dead
sleep
76
7
thou
even
thou
art
to
be
feared
and
who
may
stand
in
thy
sight
when
once
thou
art
angry
76
8
thou
didst
cause
judgment
to
be
heard
from
heaven
the
earth
feared
and
was
still
76
9
when
god
arose
to
judgment
to
save
all
the
meek
of
the
earth
selah
76
10
surely
the
wrath
of
man
shall
praise
thee
the
remainder
of
wrath
shalt
thou
restrain
76
11
vow
and
pay
unto
the
lord
your
god
let
all
that
be
round
about
him
bring
presents
unto
him
that
ought
to
be
feared
76
12
he
shall
cut
off
the
spirit
of
princes
he
is
terrible
to
the
kings
of
the
earth
77
1
i
cried
unto
god
with
my
voice
even
unto
god
with
my
voice
and
he
gave
ear
unto
me
77
2
in
the
day
of
my
trouble
i
sought
the
lord
my
sore
ran
in
the
night
and
ceased
not
my
soul
refused
to
be
comforted
77
3
i
remembered
god
and
was
troubled
i
complained
and
my
spirit
was
overwhelmed
selah
77
4
thou
holdest
mine
eyes
waking
i
am
so
troubled
that
i
cannot
speak
77
5
i
have
considered
the
days
of
old
the
years
of
ancient
times
77
6
i
call
to
remembrance
my
song
in
the
night
i
commune
with
mine
own
heart
and
my
spirit
made
diligent
search
77
7
will
the
lord
cast
off
for
ever
and
will
he
be
favourable
no
more
77
8
is
his
mercy
clean
gone
for
ever
doth
his
promise
fail
for
evermore
77
9
hath
god
forgotten
to
be
gracious
hath
he
in
anger
shut
up
his
tender
mercies
selah
77
10
and
i
said
this
is
my
infirmity
but
i
will
remember
the
years
of
the
right
hand
of
the
most
high
77
11
i
will
remember
the
works
of
the
lord
surely
i
will
remember
thy
wonders
of
old
77
12
i
will
meditate
also
of
all
thy
work
and
talk
of
thy
doings
77
13
thy
way
o
god
is
in
the
sanctuary
who
is
so
great
a
god
as
our
god
77
14
thou
art
the
god
that
doest
wonders
thou
hast
declared
thy
strength
among
the
people
77
15
thou
hast
with
thine
arm
redeemed
thy
people
the
sons
of
jacob
and
joseph
selah
77
16
the
waters
saw
thee
o
god
the
waters
saw
thee
they
were
afraid
the
depths
also
were
troubled
77
17
the
clouds
poured
out
water
the
skies
sent
out
a
sound
thine
arrows
also
went
abroad
77
18
the
voice
of
thy
thunder
was
in
the
heaven
the
lightnings
lightened
the
world
the
earth
trembled
and
shook
77
19
thy
way
is
in
the
sea
and
thy
path
in
the
great
waters
and
thy
footsteps
are
not
known
77
20
thou
leddest
thy
people
like
a
flock
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
aaron
78
1
give
ear
o
my
people
to
my
law
incline
your
ears
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
78
2
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
parable
i
will
utter
dark
sayings
of
old
78
3
which
we
have
heard
and
known
and
our
fathers
have
told
us
78
4
we
will
not
hide
them
from
their
children
shewing
to
the
generation
to
come
the
praises
of
the
lord
and
his
strength
and
his
wonderful
works
that
he
hath
done
78
5
for
he
established
a
testimony
in
jacob
and
appointed
a
law
in
israel
which
he
commanded
our
fathers
that
they
should
make
them
known
to
their
children
78
6
that
the
generation
to
come
might
know
them
even
the
children
which
should
be
born
who
should
arise
and
declare
them
to
their
children
78
7
that
they
might
set
their
hope
in
god
and
not
forget
the
works
of
god
but
keep
his
commandments
78
8
and
might
not
be
as
their
fathers
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation
a
generation
that
set
not
their
heart
aright
and
whose
spirit
was
not
stedfast
with
god
78
9
the
children
of
ephraim
being
armed
and
carrying
bows
turned
back
in
the
day
of
battle
78
10
they
kept
not
the
covenant
of
god
and
refused
to
walk
in
his
law
78
11
and
forgat
his
works
and
his
wonders
that
he
had
shewed
them
78
12
marvellous
things
did
he
in
the
sight
of
their
fathers
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
field
of
zoan
78
13
he
divided
the
sea
and
caused
them
to
pass
through
and
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
as
an
heap
78
14
in
the
daytime
also
he
led
them
with
a
cloud
and
all
the
night
with
a
light
of
fire
78
15
he
clave
the
rocks
in
the
wilderness
and
gave
them
drink
as
out
of
the
great
depths
78
16
he
brought
streams
also
out
of
the
rock
and
caused
waters
to
run
down
like
rivers
78
17
and
they
sinned
yet
more
against
him
by
provoking
the
most
high
in
the
wilderness
78
18
and
they
tempted
god
in
their
heart
by
asking
meat
for
their
lust
78
19
yea
they
spake
against
god
they
said
can
god
furnish
a
table
in
the
wilderness
78
20
behold
he
smote
the
rock
that
the
waters
gushed
out
and
the
streams
overflowed
can
he
give
bread
also
can
he
provide
flesh
for
his
people
78
21
therefore
the
lord
heard
this
and
was
wroth
so
a
fire
was
kindled
against
jacob
and
anger
also
came
up
against
israel
78
22
because
they
believed
not
in
god
and
trusted
not
in
his
salvation
78
23
though
he
had
commanded
the
clouds
from
above
and
opened
the
doors
of
heaven
78
24
and
had
rained
down
manna
upon
them
to
eat
and
had
given
them
of
the
corn
of
heaven
78
25
man
did
eat
angels’
food
he
sent
them
meat
to
the
full
78
26
he
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
heaven
and
by
his
power
he
brought
in
the
south
wind
78
27
he
rained
flesh
also
upon
them
as
dust
and
feathered
fowls
like
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
78
28
and
he
let
it
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
camp
round
about
their
habitations
78
29
so
they
did
eat
and
were
well
filled
for
he
gave
them
their
own
desire
78
30
they
were
not
estranged
from
their
lust
but
while
their
meat
was
yet
in
their
mouths
78
31
the
wrath
of
god
came
upon
them
and
slew
the
fattest
of
them
and
smote
down
the
chosen
men
of
israel
78
32
for
all
this
they
sinned
still
and
believed
not
for
his
wondrous
works
78
33
therefore
their
days
did
he
consume
in
vanity
and
their
years
in
trouble
78
34
when
he
slew
them
then
they
sought
him
and
they
returned
and
enquired
early
after
god
78
35
and
they
remembered
that
god
was
their
rock
and
the
high
god
their
redeemer
78
36
nevertheless
they
did
flatter
him
with
their
mouth
and
they
lied
unto
him
with
their
tongues
78
37
for
their
heart
was
not
right
with
him
neither
were
they
stedfast
in
his
covenant
78
38
but
he
being
full
of
compassion
forgave
their
iniquity
and
destroyed
them
not
yea
many
a
time
turned
he
his
anger
away
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
wrath
78
39
for
he
remembered
that
they
were
but
flesh
a
wind
that
passeth
away
and
cometh
not
again
78
40
how
oft
did
they
provoke
him
in
the
wilderness
and
grieve
him
in
the
desert
78
41
yea
they
turned
back
and
tempted
god
and
limited
the
holy
one
of
israel
78
42
they
remembered
not
his
hand
nor
the
day
when
he
delivered
them
from
the
enemy
78
43
how
he
had
wrought
his
signs
in
egypt
and
his
wonders
in
the
field
of
zoan
78
44
and
had
turned
their
rivers
into
blood
and
their
floods
that
they
could
not
drink
78
45
he
sent
divers
sorts
of
flies
among
them
which
devoured
them
and
frogs
which
destroyed
them
78
46
he
gave
also
their
increase
unto
the
caterpiller
and
their
labour
unto
the
locust
78
47
he
destroyed
their
vines
with
hail
and
their
sycomore
trees
with
frost
78
48
he
gave
up
their
cattle
also
to
the
hail
and
their
flocks
to
hot
thunderbolts
78
49
he
cast
upon
them
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
wrath
and
indignation
and
trouble
by
sending
evil
angels
among
them
78
50
he
made
a
way
to
his
anger
he
spared
not
their
soul
from
death
but
gave
their
life
over
to
the
pestilence
78
51
and
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
egypt
the
chief
of
their
strength
in
the
tabernacles
of
ham
78
52
but
made
his
own
people
to
go
forth
like
sheep
and
guided
them
in
the
wilderness
like
a
flock
78
53
and
he
led
them
on
safely
so
that
they
feared
not
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
enemies
78
54
and
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
sanctuary
even
to
this
mountain
which
his
right
hand
had
purchased
78
55
he
cast
out
the
heathen
also
before
them
and
divided
them
an
inheritance
by
line
and
made
the
tribes
of
israel
to
dwell
in
their
tents
78
56
yet
they
tempted
and
provoked
the
most
high
god
and
kept
not
his
testimonies
78
57
but
turned
back
and
dealt
unfaithfully
like
their
fathers
they
were
turned
aside
like
a
deceitful
bow
78
58
for
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
high
places
and
moved
him
to
jealousy
with
their
graven
images
78
59
when
god
heard
this
he
was
wroth
and
greatly
abhorred
israel
78
60
so
that
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
shiloh
the
tent
which
he
placed
among
men
78
61
and
delivered
his
strength
into
captivity
and
his
glory
into
the
enemy’s
hand
78
62
he
gave
his
people
over
also
unto
the
sword
and
was
wroth
with
his
inheritance
78
63
the
fire
consumed
their
young
men
and
their
maidens
were
not
given
to
marriage
78
64
their
priests
fell
by
the
sword
and
their
widows
made
no
lamentation
78
65
then
the
lord
awaked
as
one
out
of
sleep
and
like
a
mighty
man
that
shouteth
by
reason
of
wine
78
66
and
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
parts
he
put
them
to
a
perpetual
reproach
78
67
moreover
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
joseph
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
ephraim
78
68
but
chose
the
tribe
of
judah
the
mount
zion
which
he
loved
78
69
and
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
high
palaces
like
the
earth
which
he
hath
established
for
ever
78
70
he
chose
david
also
his
servant
and
took
him
from
the
sheepfolds
78
71
from
following
the
ewes
great
with
young
he
brought
him
to
feed
jacob
his
people
and
israel
his
inheritance
78
72
so
he
fed
them
according
to
the
integrity
of
his
heart
and
guided
them
by
the
skilfulness
of
his
hands
79
1
o
god
the
heathen
are
come
into
thine
inheritance
thy
holy
temple
have
they
defiled
they
have
laid
jerusalem
on
heaps
79
2
the
dead
bodies
of
thy
servants
have
they
given
to
be
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
the
flesh
of
thy
saints
unto
the
beasts
of
the
earth
79
3
their
blood
have
they
shed
like
water
round
about
jerusalem
and
there
was
none
to
bury
them
79
4
we
are
become
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours
a
scorn
and
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us
79
5
how
long
lord
wilt
thou
be
angry
for
ever
shall
thy
jealousy
burn
like
fire
79
6
pour
out
thy
wrath
upon
the
heathen
that
have
not
known
thee
and
upon
the
kingdoms
that
have
not
called
upon
thy
name
79
7
for
they
have
devoured
jacob
and
laid
waste
his
dwelling
place
79
8
o
remember
not
against
us
former
iniquities
let
thy
tender
mercies
speedily
prevent
us
for
we
are
brought
very
low
79
9
help
us
o
god
of
our
salvation
for
the
glory
of
thy
name
and
deliver
us
and
purge
away
our
sins
for
thy
name’s
sake
79
10
wherefore
should
the
heathen
say
where
is
their
god
let
him
be
known
among
the
heathen
in
our
sight
by
the
revenging
of
the
blood
of
thy
servants
which
is
shed
79
11
let
the
sighing
of
the
prisoner
come
before
thee
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
power
preserve
thou
those
that
are
appointed
to
die
79
12
and
render
unto
our
neighbours
sevenfold
into
their
bosom
their
reproach
wherewith
they
have
reproached
thee
o
lord
79
13
so
we
thy
people
and
sheep
of
thy
pasture
will
give
thee
thanks
for
ever
we
will
shew
forth
thy
praise
to
all
generations
80
1
give
ear
o
shepherd
of
israel
thou
that
leadest
joseph
like
a
flock
thou
that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
shine
forth
80
2
before
ephraim
and
benjamin
and
manasseh
stir
up
thy
strength
and
come
and
save
us
80
3
turn
us
again
o
god
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
80
4
o
lord
god
of
hosts
how
long
wilt
thou
be
angry
against
the
prayer
of
thy
people
80
5
thou
feedest
them
with
the
bread
of
tears
and
givest
them
tears
to
drink
in
great
measure
80
6
thou
makest
us
a
strife
unto
our
neighbours
and
our
enemies
laugh
among
themselves
80
7
turn
us
again
o
god
of
hosts
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
80
8
thou
hast
brought
a
vine
out
of
egypt
thou
hast
cast
out
the
heathen
and
planted
it
80
9
thou
preparedst
room
before
it
and
didst
cause
it
to
take
deep
root
and
it
filled
the
land
80
10
the
hills
were
covered
with
the
shadow
of
it
and
the
boughs
thereof
were
like
the
goodly
cedars
80
11
she
sent
out
her
boughs
unto
the
sea
and
her
branches
unto
the
river
80
12
why
hast
thou
then
broken
down
her
hedges
so
that
all
they
which
pass
by
the
way
do
pluck
her
80
13
the
boar
out
of
the
wood
doth
waste
it
and
the
wild
beast
of
the
field
doth
devour
it
80
14
return
we
beseech
thee
o
god
of
hosts
look
down
from
heaven
and
behold
and
visit
this
vine
80
15
and
the
vineyard
which
thy
right
hand
hath
planted
and
the
branch
that
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself
80
16
it
is
burned
with
fire
it
is
cut
down
they
perish
at
the
rebuke
of
thy
countenance
80
17
let
thy
hand
be
upon
the
man
of
thy
right
hand
upon
the
son
of
man
whom
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself
80
18
so
will
not
we
go
back
from
thee
quicken
us
and
we
will
call
upon
thy
name
80
19
turn
us
again
o
lord
god
of
hosts
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
81
1
sing
aloud
unto
god
our
strength
make
a
joyful
noise
unto
the
god
of
jacob
81
2
take
a
psalm
and
bring
hither
the
timbrel
the
pleasant
harp
with
the
psaltery
81
3
blow
up
the
trumpet
in
the
new
moon
in
the
time
appointed
on
our
solemn
feast
day
81
4
for
this
was
a
statute
for
israel
and
a
law
of
the
god
of
jacob
81
5
this
he
ordained
in
joseph
for
a
testimony
when
he
went
out
through
the
land
of
egypt
where
i
heard
a
language
that
i
understood
not
81
6
i
removed
his
shoulder
from
the
burden
his
hands
were
delivered
from
the
pots
81
7
thou
calledst
in
trouble
and
i
delivered
thee
i
answered
thee
in
the
secret
place
of
thunder
i
proved
thee
at
the
waters
of
meribah
selah
81
8
hear
o
my
people
and
i
will
testify
unto
thee
o
israel
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
me
81
9
there
shall
no
strange
god
be
in
thee
neither
shalt
thou
worship
any
strange
god
81
10
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
open
thy
mouth
wide
and
i
will
fill
it
81
11
but
my
people
would
not
hearken
to
my
voice
and
israel
would
none
of
me
81
12
so
i
gave
them
up
unto
their
own
hearts’
lust
and
they
walked
in
their
own
counsels
81
13
oh
that
my
people
had
hearkened
unto
me
and
israel
had
walked
in
my
ways
81
14
i
should
soon
have
subdued
their
enemies
and
turned
my
hand
against
their
adversaries
81
15
the
haters
of
the
lord
should
have
submitted
themselves
unto
him
but
their
time
should
have
endured
for
ever
81
16
he
should
have
fed
them
also
with
the
finest
of
the
wheat
and
with
honey
out
of
the
rock
should
i
have
satisfied
thee
82
1
god
standeth
in
the
congregation
of
the
mighty
he
judgeth
among
the
gods
82
2
how
long
will
ye
judge
unjustly
and
accept
the
persons
of
the
wicked
selah
82
3
defend
the

and
fatherless
do

them
out
of

wicked
82
5
they

not
neither
will
they
understand
they
walk
on
in
darkness
all
the
foundations
of
the
earth
are
out
of
course
82
6
i
have
said
ye
are
gods
and
all
of
you
are
children
of
the
most
high
82
7
but
ye
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
like

arise

the
earth
for
thou
shalt
inherit
all
nations
83
1
keep
not
thou
silence
o
god
hold
not
thy
peace
and
be
not
still
o
god
83
2
for
lo
thine
enemies
make
a
tumult
and
they
that
hate
thee
have
lifted
up
the
head
83
3
they
have
taken
crafty
counsel
against
thy
people
and
consulted
against
thy
hidden
ones
83
4
they
have
said
come
and
let
us
cut
them
off
from
being
a
nation
that
the
name
of
israel
may
be
no
more
in
remembrance
83
5
for
they
have
consulted
together
with
one
consent
they
are
confederate
against
thee
83
6
the
tabernacles
of
edom
and
the
ishmaelites
of
moab
and
the
hagarenes
83
7
gebal

philistines
with

assur
also

them
they

holpen
the
children
of

selah
83
9
do
unto
them
as
unto
the
midianites
as
to
sisera
as
to
jabin
at
the
brook
of
kison
83
10
which
perished
at
endor
they
became
as
dung
for
the
earth
83
11
make
their
nobles
like
oreb
and
like
zeeb
yea
all
their
princes
as
zebah
and
as
zalmunna
83
12
who
said
let
us
take
to
ourselves
the
houses
of
god
in
possession
83
13
o
my
god
make
them
like
a
wheel
as
the
stubble
before
the
wind
83
14
as
the
fire
burneth
a
wood
and
as
the
flame
setteth
the
mountains
on
fire
83
15
so
persecute
them
with
thy
tempest
and
make
them
afraid
with
thy
storm
83
16
fill
their
faces
with
shame
that
they
may
seek
thy
name
o
lord
83
17
let
them
be
confounded
and
troubled
for
ever
yea
let
them
be
put
to
shame
and
perish
83
18
that
men
may
know
that
thou
whose
name
alone
is
jehovah
art
the
most
high
over
all
the
earth
84

how
amiable
are
thy
tabernacles
o

of
hosts
84

my
soul
longeth
yea
even
fainteth
for
the
courts
of
the
lord
my
heart
and
my
flesh
crieth
out
for
the
living
god
84
3
yea
the
sparrow
hath
found
an
house
and
the
swallow
a
nest
for
herself
where
she
may
lay
her
young
even
thine
altars
o

thou
off
my
soul

thou
thy
face
from
me

afflicted
and
ready
to
die
from
my
youth

fierce
wrath

terrors

me
daily
like

compassed
me
about

a
strong
lord
like
unto
thee
or
to
thy
faithfulness
round
about
thee
89
9
thou
rulest
the
raging
of
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
arise
thou
stillest
them
89
10
thou
hast
broken
rahab
in
pieces

slain
thou
hast
scattered
thine
enemies
with
thy
strong
arm
89
11

the
people
that

the
joyful
sound

shall
walk
o

in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
89
16
in
thy
name
shall
they
rejoice
all
the
day
and
in
thy
righteousness
shall
they
be
exalted

17
for
thou
art
the
glory
of
their
strength
and

18
for

lord

our
defence
and
the
holy
one
of
israel
is
our
king
89
19
then
thou
spakest
in
vision
to
thy
holy
one
and
saidst
i
have
laid
help
upon
one
that
is
mighty
i
have
exalted
one
chosen
out
of
the
people
89
20
i
have
found
david
my
servant
with
my
holy
oil
have
i
anointed
him
89
21
with
whom
my
hand
shall
be
established
mine
arm
also
shall
strengthen
him
89
22
the
enemy
shall
not
exact
upon
him
nor
the
son
of
wickedness
afflict
him
89
23
and
i
will
beat
down
his
foes
before
his
face
and
plague
them
that
hate
him
89
24
but
my
faithfulness
and
my
mercy
shall
be
with
him
and
in
my
name
shall
his
horn
be
exalted
89
25
i
will
set
his
hand
also
in
the
sea
and
his
right
hand
in
the
rivers
89
26
he
shall
cry
unto
me
thou
art
my
father
my
god
and
the
rock
of
my
salvation
89
27
also
i
will
make
him
my
firstborn
higher
than
the
kings
of
the
earth
89
28
my
mercy
will
i
keep
for
him
for
evermore
and
my
covenant
shall
stand
fast
with
him
89
29
his
seed
also
will
i
make
to
endure
for
ever
and
his
throne
as
the
days
of
heaven
89
30
if
his
children
forsake
my
law
and
walk
not
in
my
judgments
89
31
if
they
break
my
statutes
and
keep
not
my
commandments
89
32
then
will
i
visit
their
transgression
with
the
rod
and
their
iniquity
with
stripes
89
33
nevertheless
my
lovingkindness
will
i
not
utterly
take
from
him
nor
suffer
my
faithfulness
to
fail
89
34
my
covenant
will
i
not
break
nor
alter
the
thing
that
is
gone
out
of
my
lips
89
35
once
have
i
sworn
by
my
holiness
that
i
will
not
lie
unto
david
89
36
his
seed
shall
endure
for
ever
and
his
throne
as
the
sun
before
me
89
37
it
shall
be
established
for
ever
as
the
moon
and
as
a
faithful
witness
in
heaven
selah
89
38
but
thou
hast
cast
off
and
abhorred
thou
hast
been
wroth
with
thine
anointed
89
39
thou
hast
made
void
the
covenant
of
thy
servant
thou
hast
profaned
his
crown
by
casting
it
to
the
ground
89
40
thou
hast
broken
down
all
his
hedges
thou
hast
brought
his
strong
holds
to
ruin
89
41
all
that
pass
by
the
way
spoil
him
he
is
a
reproach
to
his
neighbours
89
42
thou
hast
set
up
the
right
hand
of
his
adversaries
thou
hast
made
all
his
enemies
to
rejoice
89
43
thou
hast
also
turned
the
edge
of
his
sword
and
hast
not
made
him
to
stand
in
the
battle
89
44
thou
hast
made
his
glory
to
cease
and
cast
his
throne
down
to
the
ground
89
45
the
days
of
his
youth
hast
thou
shortened
thou
hast
covered
him
with
shame
selah
89
46
how
long
lord
wilt
thou
hide
thyself
for
ever
shall
thy
wrath
burn
like
fire
89
47
remember
how
short
my
time
is
wherefore
hast
thou
made
all
men
in
vain
89
48
what
man
is
he
that
liveth
and
shall
not
see
death
shall
he
deliver
his
soul
from
the
hand
of
the
grave
selah
89
49
lord
where
are
thy
former
lovingkindnesses
which
thou
swarest
unto
david
in
thy
truth
89
50
remember
lord
the
reproach
of
thy
servants
how
i
do
bear
in
my
bosom
the
reproach
of
all
the
mighty
people
89
51
wherewith
thine
enemies
have
reproached
o
lord
wherewith
they
have
reproached
the
footsteps
of
thine
anointed
89
52
blessed
be
the
lord
for
evermore
amen
and
amen
90
1
lord
thou
hast
been
our
dwelling
place
in
all
generations
90
2
before
the
mountains
were
brought
forth
or
ever
thou
hadst
formed
the
earth
and
the
world
even
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
thou
art
god
90
3
thou
turnest
man
to
destruction
and
sayest
return
ye
children
of
men
90
4
for
a
thousand
years
in
thy
sight
are
but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past
and
as
a
watch
in
the
night
90
5
thou
carriest
them
away
as
with
a
flood
they
are
as
a
sleep
in
the
morning
they
are
like
grass
which
groweth
up
90
6
in
the
morning
it
flourisheth
and
groweth
up
in
the
evening
it
is
cut
down
and
withereth
90
7
for
we
are
consumed
by
thine
anger
and
by
thy
wrath
are
we
troubled
90
8
thou
hast
set
our
iniquities
before
thee
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
90
9
for
all
our
days
are
passed
away
in
thy
wrath
we
spend
our
years
as
a
tale
that
is
told
90
10
the
days
of
our
years
are
threescore
years
and
ten
and
if
by
reason
of
strength
they
be
fourscore
years
yet
is
their
strength
labour
and
sorrow
for
it
is
soon
cut
off
and
we
fly
away
90
11
who
knoweth
the
power
of
thine
anger
even
according
to
thy
fear
so
is
thy
wrath
90
12
so
teach
us
to
number
our
days
that
we
may
apply
our
hearts
unto
wisdom
90
13
return
o
lord
how
long
and
let
it
repent
thee
concerning
thy
servants
90
14
o
satisfy
us
early
with
thy
mercy
that
we
may
rejoice
and
be
glad
all
our
days
90
15
make
us
glad
according
to
the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
us
and
the
years
wherein
we
have
seen
evil
90
16
let
thy
work
appear
unto
thy
servants
and
thy
glory
unto
their
children
90
17
and
let
the
beauty
of
the
lord
our
god
be
upon

the
work
of
our
hands
upon
us
yea
the
work
of
our
hands
establish
thou
it
91
1
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
91
2
i
will
say
of
the
lord
he
is
my
refuge
and
my
fortress
my
god
in
him
will
i
trust
91
3
surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
91
4
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler
91
5
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
91
6
nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
91
7
a
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
side
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
hand
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
thee
91
8
only
with
thine
eyes
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
wicked
91
9
because
thou
hast
made
the
lord
which
is
my
refuge
even
the
most
high
thy
habitation
91
10
there
shall
no
evil
befall
thee
neither
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
dwelling
91
11
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
91
12
they
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
hands
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
91
13
thou
shalt
tread
upon
the
lion
and
adder
the
young
lion
and
the
dragon
shalt
thou
trample
under
feet
91
14
because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
me
therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
set
him
on
high
because
he
hath
known
my
name
91
15
he
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
answer
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
trouble
i
will
deliver
him
and
honour
him
91
16
with
long
life
will
i
satisfy
him
and
shew
him
my
salvation
92
1
it
is
a
good
thing
to
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
and
to
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
o
most
high
92
2
to
shew
forth
thy
lovingkindness
in
the
morning
and
thy
faithfulness
every
night
92
3
upon
an
instrument
of
ten
strings
and
upon
the
psaltery
upon
the
harp
with
a
solemn
sound
92
4
for
thou
lord
hast
made
me
glad
through
thy
work
i
will
triumph
in
the
works
of
thy
hands
92
5
o
lord
how
great
are
thy
works
and
thy
thoughts
are
very
deep
92
6
a
brutish
man
knoweth
not
neither
doth
a
fool
understand
this
92
7
when
the
wicked
spring
as
the
grass
and
when
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
do
flourish
it
is
that
they
shall
be
destroyed
for
ever
92
8
but
thou
lord
art
most
high
for
evermore
92
9
for
lo
thine
enemies
o
lord
for
lo
thine
enemies
shall
perish
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
shall
be
scattered
92
10
but
my
horn
shalt
thou
exalt
like
the
horn
of
an
unicorn
i
shall
be
anointed
with
fresh
oil
92
11
mine
eye
also
shall
see
my
desire
on
mine
enemies
and
mine
ears
shall
hear
my
desire
of
the
wicked
that
rise
up
against
me
92
12
the
righteous
shall
flourish
like
the
palm
tree
he
shall
grow
like
a
cedar
in
lebanon
92
13
those
that
be
planted
in
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
flourish
in
the
courts
of
our
god
92
14
they
shall
still
bring
forth
fruit
in
old
age
they
shall
be
fat
and
flourishing
92
15
to
shew
that
the
lord
is
upright
he
is
my
rock
and
there
is
no
unrighteousness
in
him
93
1
the
lord
reigneth
he
is
clothed
with
majesty
the
lord
is
clothed
with
strength
wherewith
he
hath
girded
himself
the
world
also
is
stablished
that
it
cannot
be
moved
93
2
thy
throne
is
established
of
old
thou
art
from
everlasting
93
3
the
floods
have
lifted
up
o
lord
the
floods
have
lifted
up
their
voice
the
floods
lift
up
their
waves
93
4
the
lord
on
high
is
mightier
than
the
noise
of
many
waters
yea
than
the
mighty
waves
of
the
sea
93
5
thy
testimonies
are
very
sure
holiness
becometh
thine
house
o
lord
for
ever
94
1
o
lord
god
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth
o
god
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth
shew
thyself
94
2
lift
up
thyself
thou
judge
of
the
earth
render
a
reward
to
the
proud
94
3
lord
how
long
shall
the
wicked
how
long
shall
the
wicked
triumph
94
4
how
long
shall
they
utter
and
speak
hard
things
and
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
boast
themselves
94
5
they
break
in
pieces
thy
people
o
lord
and
afflict
thine
heritage
94
6
they
slay
the
widow
and
the
stranger
and
murder
the
fatherless
94
7
yet
they
say
the
lord
shall
not
see
neither
shall
the
god
of
jacob
regard
it
94
8
understand
ye
brutish
among
the
people
and
ye
fools
when
will
ye
be
wise
94
9
he
that
planted
the
ear
shall
he
not
hear
he
that
formed
the
eye
shall
he
not
see
94
10
he
that
chastiseth
the
heathen
shall
not
he
correct
he
that
teacheth
man
knowledge
shall
not
he
know
94
11
the
lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
man
that
they
are
vanity
94
12
blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
chastenest
o
lord
and
teachest
him
out
of
thy
law
94
13
that
thou
mayest
give
him
rest
from
the
days
of
adversity
until
the
pit
be
digged
for
the
wicked
94
14
for
the
lord
will
not
cast
off
his
people
neither
will
he
forsake
his
inheritance
94
15
but
judgment
shall
return
unto
righteousness
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
follow
it
94
16
who
will
rise
up
for
me
against
the
evildoers
or
who
will
stand
up
for
me
against
the
workers
of
iniquity
94
17
unless
the
lord
had
been
my
help
my
soul
had
almost
dwelt
in
silence
94
18
when
i
said
my
foot
slippeth
thy
mercy
o
lord
held
me
up
94
19
in
the
multitude
of
my
thoughts
within
me
thy
comforts
delight
my
soul
94
20
shall
the
throne
of
iniquity
have
fellowship
with
thee
which
frameth
mischief
by
a
law
94
21
they
gather
themselves
together
against
the
soul
of
the
righteous
and
condemn
the
innocent
blood
94
22
but
the
lord
is
my
defence
and
my
god
is
the
rock
of
my
refuge
94
23
and
he
shall
bring
upon
them
their
own
iniquity
and
shall
cut
them
off
in
their
own
wickedness
yea
the
lord
our
god
shall
cut
them
off
95

by
reason
of
the
voice
of
my
groaning
my
bones
cleave
to
my
skin
102
6
i
am
like
a
pelican
of
the
wilderness
i
am
like
an
owl
of
the
desert
102
7
i
watch
and
am
as
a
sparrow
alone
upon
the

top
102
8
mine
enemies
reproach
me
all
the
day
and
they
that
are
mad
against
me
are
sworn
against
me
102
9
for
i
have
eaten
ashes
like
bread
and
mingled
my
drink
with
weeping
102
10
because
of
thine
indignation
and
thy
wrath
for
thou
hast
lifted
me
up
and
cast
me
down
102
11
my
days
are
like
a
shadow
that
declineth
and
i
am
withered
like
grass
102
12
but
thou
o
lord
shall
endure
for
ever
and
thy
remembrance
unto
all
generations
102
13
thou
shalt
arise
and
have
mercy
upon
zion
for
the
time
to
favour
her
yea
the
set
time
is
come
102
14
for
thy
servants
take
pleasure
in
her
stones
and
favour
the
dust
thereof
102
15
so
the
heathen
shall
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
thy
glory
102
16
when
the
lord
shall
build
up
zion
he
shall
appear
in
his
glory
102
17
he
will
regard
the
prayer
of
the
destitute
and
not
despise
their
prayer
102
18
this
shall
be
written
for
the
generation
to
come
and
the
people
which
shall
be
created
shall
praise
the
lord
102
19
for
he
hath
looked
down
from
the
height
of
his
sanctuary
from
heaven
did
the
lord
behold
the
earth
102
20
to
hear
the
groaning
of
the
prisoner
to
loose
those
that
are
appointed
to
death
102
21
to
declare
the
name
of
the
lord
in
zion
and
his
praise
in
jerusalem
102
22
when
the
people
are
gathered
together
and
the
kingdoms
to
serve
the
lord
102
23
he
weakened
my
strength
in
the
way
he
shortened
my
days
102
24
i
said
o
my
god
take
me
not
away
in
the
midst
of
my
days
thy
years
are
throughout
all
generations
102
25
of
old
hast
thou
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
work
of
thy
hands
102
26
they
shall
perish
but
thou
shalt
endure
yea
all
of
them
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
change
them
and
they
shall
be
changed
102
27
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
have
no
end
102
28
the
children
of
thy
servants
shall
continue
and
their
seed
shall
be
established
before
thee
103
1
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
name
103
2
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
forget
not
all
his
benefits
103
3
who
forgiveth
all
thine
iniquities
who
healeth
all
thy
diseases
103
4
who
redeemeth
thy
life
from
destruction
who
crowneth
thee
with
lovingkindness
and
tender
mercies
103
5
who
satisfieth
thy
mouth
with
good
things
so
that
thy
youth
is
renewed
like
the
eagle’s
103
6
the
lord
executeth
righteousness
and
judgment
for
all
that
are
oppressed
103
7
he
made
known
his
ways
unto
moses
his
acts
unto
the
children
of
israel
103
8
the
lord
is
merciful
and
gracious
slow
to
anger
and
plenteous
in
mercy
103
9
he
will
not
always
chide
neither
will
he
keep
his
anger
for
ever
103
10
he
hath
not
dealt
with
us
after
our
sins
nor
rewarded
us
according
to
our
iniquities
103
11
for
as
the
heaven
is
high
above
the
earth
so
great
is
his
mercy
toward
them
that
fear
him
103
12
as
far
as
the
east
is
from
the
west
so
far
hath
he
removed
our
transgressions
from
us
103
13
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
lord
pitieth
them
that
fear
him
103
14
for
he
knoweth
our
frame
he
remembereth
that
we
are
dust
103
15
as
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
as
a
flower
of
the
field
so
he
flourisheth
103
16
for
the
wind
passeth
over
it
and
it
is
gone
and
the
place
thereof
shall
know
it
no
more
103
17
but
the
mercy
of
the
lord
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
upon
them
that
fear
him
and
his
righteousness
unto
children’s
children
103
18
to
such
as
keep
his
covenant
and
to
those
that
remember
his
commandments
to
do
them
103
19
the
lord
hath
prepared
his
throne
in
the
heavens
and
his
kingdom
ruleth
over
all
103
20
bless
the
lord
ye
his
angels
that
excel
in
strength
that
do
his
commandments
hearkening
unto
the
voice
of
his
word
103
21
bless
ye
the
lord
all
ye
his
hosts
ye
ministers
of
his
that
do
his
pleasure
103
22
bless
the
lord
all
his
works
in
all
places
of
his
dominion
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
104
1
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
o
lord
my
god
thou
art
very
great
thou
art
clothed
with
honour
and
majesty
104
2
who
coverest
thyself
with
light
as
with
a
garment
who
stretchest
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain
104
3
who
layeth
the
beams
of
his
chambers
in
the
waters
who
maketh
the
clouds
his
chariot
who
walketh
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
104
4
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
104
5
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
that
it
should
not
be
removed
for
ever
104
6
thou
coveredst
it
with
the
deep
as
with
a
garment
the
waters
stood
above
the
mountains
104
7
at
thy
rebuke
they
fled
at
the
voice
of
thy
thunder
they
hasted
away
104
8
they
go
up
by
the
mountains
they
go
down
by
the
valleys
unto
the
place
which
thou
hast
founded
for
them
104
9
thou
hast
set
a
bound
that
they
may
not
pass
over
that
they
turn
not
again
to
cover
the
earth
104
10
he
sendeth
the
springs
into
the
valleys
which
run
among
the
hills
104
11
they
give
drink
to
every
beast
of
the
field
the
wild
asses
quench
their
thirst
104
12
by
them
shall
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
have
their
habitation
which
sing
among
the
branches
104
13
he
watereth
the
hills
from
his
chambers
the
earth
is
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
thy
works
104
14
he
causeth
the
grass
to
grow
for
the
cattle
and
herb
for
the
service
of
man
that
he
may
bring
forth
food
out
of
the
earth
104
15
and
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
and
oil
to
make
his
face
to
shine
and
bread
which
strengtheneth
man’s
heart
104
16
the
trees
of
the
lord
are
full
of
sap
the
cedars
of
lebanon
which
he
hath
planted
104
17
where
the
birds
make
their
nests
as
for
the
stork
the
fir
trees
are
her
house
104
18
the
high
hills
are
a
refuge
for
the
wild
goats
and
the
rocks
for
the
conies
104
19
he
appointed
the
moon
for
seasons
the
sun
knoweth
his
going
down
104
20
thou
makest
darkness
and
it
is
night
wherein
all
the
beasts
of
the
forest
do
creep
forth
104
21
the
young
lions
roar
after
their
prey
and
seek
their
meat
from
god
104
22
the
sun
ariseth
they
gather
themselves
together
and
lay
them
down
in
their
dens
104
23
man
goeth
forth
unto
his
work
and
to
his
labour
until
the
evening
104
24
o
lord
how
manifold
are
thy
works
in
wisdom
hast
thou
made
them
all
the
earth
is
full
of
thy
riches
104
25
so
is
this
great
and
wide
sea
wherein
are
things
creeping
innumerable
both
small
and
great
beasts
104
26
there
go
the
ships
there
is
that
leviathan
whom
thou
hast
made
to
play
therein
104
27
these
wait
all
upon
thee
that
thou
mayest
give
them
their
meat
in
due
season
104
28
that
thou
givest
them
they
gather
thou
openest
thine
hand
they
are
filled
with
good
104
29
thou
hidest
thy
face
they
are
troubled
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
and
return
to
their
dust
104
30
thou
sendest
forth
thy
spirit
they
are
created
and
thou
renewest
the
face
of
the
earth
104
31
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
endure
for
ever
the
lord
shall
rejoice
in
his
works
104
32
he
looketh
on
the
earth
and
it
trembleth
he
toucheth
the
hills
and
they
smoke
104
33
i
will
sing
unto
the
lord
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
sing
praise
to
my
god
while
i
have
my
being
104
34
my
meditation
of
him
shall
be
sweet
i
will
be
glad
in
the
lord
104
35
let
the
sinners
be
consumed
out
of
the
earth
and
let
the
wicked
be
no
more

105
5
remember
his
marvellous
works
that
he
hath
done
his
wonders
and
the
judgments
of
his
mouth
105
6
o
ye
seed
of
abraham
his
servant
ye
children
of
jacob
his
chosen
105
7
he
is
the
lord
our
god
his
judgments
are
in
all
the
earth
105
8
he
hath
remembered
his
covenant
for
ever
the
word
which
he
commanded
to
a
thousand
generations
105
9
which
covenant
he
made
with
abraham
and
his
oath
unto
isaac
105
10
and
confirmed
the
same
unto
jacob
for
a
law
and
to
israel
for
an
everlasting
covenant
105
11
saying
unto
thee
will
i
give
the
land
of
canaan
the
lot
of
your
inheritance
105
12
when
they
were
but
a
few
men
in
number
yea
very
few
and
strangers
in
it
105
13
when
they
went
from
one
nation
to
another
from
one
kingdom
to
another
people
105
14
he
suffered
no
man
to
do
them
wrong
yea
he
reproved
kings
for
their
sakes
105
15
saying
touch
not
mine
anointed
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm
105
16
moreover
he
called
for
a
famine
upon
the
land
he
brake
the
whole
staff
of
bread
105
17
he
sent
a
man
before
them
even
joseph
who
was
sold
for
a
servant
105
18
whose
feet
they
hurt
with
fetters
he
was
laid
in
iron
105
19
until
the
time
that
his
word
came
the
word
of
the
lord
tried
him
105
20
the
king
sent
and
loosed
him
even
the
ruler
of
the
people
and
let
him
go
free
105
21
he
made
him
lord
of
his
house
and
ruler
of
all
his
substance
105
22
to
bind
his
princes
at
his
pleasure
and
teach
his
senators
wisdom
105
23
israel
also
came
into
egypt
and
jacob
sojourned
in
the
land
of
ham
105
24
and
he
increased
his
people
greatly
and
made
them
stronger
than
their
enemies
105
25
he
turned
their
heart
to
hate
his
people
to
deal
subtilly
with
his
servants
105
26
he
sent
moses
his
servant
and
aaron
whom
he
had
chosen
105
27
they
shewed
his
signs
among
them
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
ham
105
28
he
sent
darkness
and
made
it
dark
and
they
rebelled
not
against
his
word
105
29
he
turned
their
waters
into
blood
and
slew
their
fish
105
30
their
land
brought
forth
frogs
in
abundance
in
the
chambers
of
their
kings
105
31
he
spake
and
there
came
divers
sorts
of
flies
and
lice
in
all
their
coasts
105
32
he
gave
them
hail
for
rain
and
flaming
fire
in
their
land
105
33
he
smote
their
vines
also
and
their
fig
trees
and
brake
the
trees
of
their
coasts
105
34
he
spake
and
the
locusts
came
and
caterpillers
and
that
without
number
105
35
and
did
eat
up
all
the
herbs
in
their
land
and
devoured
the
fruit
of
their
ground
105
36
he
smote
also
all
the
firstborn
in
their
land
the
chief
of
all
their
strength
105
37
he
brought
them
forth
also
with
silver
and
gold
and
there
was
not
one
feeble
person
among
their
tribes
105
38
egypt
was
glad
when
they
departed
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
them
105
39
he
spread
a
cloud
for
a
covering
and
fire
to
give
light
in
the
night
105
40
the
people
asked
and
he
brought
quails
and
satisfied
them
with
the
bread
of
heaven
105
41
he
opened
the
rock
and
the
waters
gushed
out
they
ran
in
the
dry
places
like
a
river
105
42
for
he
remembered
his
holy
promise
and
abraham
his
servant
105
43
and
he
brought
forth
his
people
with
joy
and
his
chosen
with
gladness
105
44
and
gave
them
the
lands
of
the
heathen
and
they
inherited
the
labour
of
the
people
105
45
that
they
might
observe
his
statutes
and
keep
his
laws
praise
ye
the
lord
106
1
praise
ye
the
lord
o
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
106
2
who
can
utter
the
mighty
acts
of
the
lord
who
can
shew
forth
all
his
praise
106
3
blessed
are
they
that
keep
judgment
and
he
that
doeth
righteousness
at
all
times
106
4
remember
me
o
lord
with
the
favour
that
thou
bearest
unto
thy
people
o
visit
me
with
thy
salvation
106
5
that
i
may
see
the
good
of
thy
chosen
that
i
may
rejoice
in
the
gladness
of
thy
nation
that
i
may
glory
with
thine
inheritance
106
6
we
have
sinned
with
our
fathers
we
have
committed
iniquity
we
have
done
wickedly
106
7
our
fathers
understood
not
thy
wonders
in
egypt
they
remembered
not
the
multitude
of
thy
mercies
but
provoked
him
at
the
sea
even
at
the
red
sea
106
8
nevertheless
he
saved
them
for
his
name’s
sake
that
he
might
make
his
mighty
power
to
be
known
106
9
he
rebuked
the
red
sea
also
and
it
was
dried
up
so
he
led
them
through
the
depths
as
through
the
wilderness
106
10
and
he
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
him
that
hated
them
and
redeemed
them
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
106
11
and
the
waters
covered
their
enemies
there
was
not
one
of
them
left
106
12
then
believed
they
his
words
they
sang
his
praise
106
13
they
soon
forgat
his
works
they
waited
not
for
his
counsel
106
14
but
lusted
exceedingly
in
the
wilderness
and
tempted
god
in
the
desert
106
15
and
he
gave
them
their
request
but
sent
leanness
into
their
soul
106
16
they
envied
moses
also
in
the
camp
and
aaron
the
saint
of
the
lord
106
17
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
dathan
and
covered
the
company
of
abiram
106
18
and
a
fire
was
kindled
in
their
company
the
flame
burned
up
the
wicked
106
19
they
made
a
calf
in
horeb
and
worshipped
the
molten
image
106
20
thus
they
changed
their
glory
into
the
similitude
of
an
ox
that
eateth
grass
106
21
they
forgat
god
their
saviour
which
had
done
great
things
in
egypt
106
22
wondrous
works
in
the
land
of
ham
and
terrible
things
by
the
red
sea
106
23
therefore
he
said
that
he
would
destroy
them
had
not
moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
in
the
breach
to
turn
away
his
wrath
lest
he
should
destroy
them
106
24
yea
they
despised
the
pleasant
land
they
believed
not
his
word
106
25
but
murmured
in
their
tents
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
106
26
therefore
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
them
to
overthrow
them
in
the
wilderness
106
27
to
overthrow
their
seed
also
among
the
nations
and
to
scatter
them
in
the
lands
106
28
they
joined
themselves
also
unto
baalpeor
and
ate
the
sacrifices
of
the
dead
106
29
thus
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
inventions
and
the
plague
brake
in
upon
them
106
30
then
stood
up
phinehas
and
executed
judgment
and
so
the
plague
was
stayed
106
31
and
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
unto
all
generations
for
evermore
106
32
they
angered
him
also
at
the
waters
of
strife
so
that
it
went
ill
with
moses
for
their
sakes
106
33
because
they
provoked
his
spirit
so
that
he
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
lips
106
34
they
did
not
destroy
the
nations
concerning
whom
the
lord
commanded
them
106
35
but
were
mingled
among
the
heathen
and
learned
their
works
106
36
and
they
served
their
idols
which
were
a
snare
unto
them
106
37
yea
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
devils
106
38
and
shed
innocent
blood
even
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
daughters
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
canaan
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
blood
106
39
thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
works
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
inventions
106
40
therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
inheritance
106
41
and
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
heathen
and
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
them
106
42
their
enemies
also
oppressed
them
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
hand
106
43
many
times
did
he
deliver
them
but
they
provoked
him
with
their
counsel
and
were
brought
low
for
their
iniquity
106
44
nevertheless
he
regarded
their
affliction
when
he
heard
their
cry
106
45
and
he
remembered
for
them
his
covenant
and
repented
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
mercies
106
46
he
made
them
also
to
be
pitied
of
all
those
that
carried
them
captives
106
47
save
us
o
lord
our
god
and
gather
us
from
among
the
heathen
to
give
thanks
unto
thy
holy
name
and
to
triumph
in
thy
praise
106
48
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
and
let
all
the
people
say
amen
praise
ye
the
lord
107
1
o
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
107
2
let
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
say
so
whom
he
hath
redeemed
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
107
3
and
gathered
them
out
of
the
lands
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
107
4
they
wandered
in
the
wilderness
in
a
solitary
way
they
found
no
city
to
dwell
in
107
5
hungry
and
thirsty
their
soul
fainted
in
them
107
6
then
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
delivered
them
out
of
their
distresses
107
7
and
he
led
them
forth
by
the
right
way
that
they
might
go
to
a
city
of
habitation
107
8
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
107
9
for
he
satisfieth
the
longing
soul
and
filleth
the
hungry
soul
with
goodness
107
10
such
as
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
being
bound
in
affliction
and
iron
107
11
because
they
rebelled
against
the
words
of
god
and
contemned
the
counsel
of
the
most
high
107
12
therefore
he
brought
down
their
heart
with
labour
they
fell
down
and
there
was
none
to
help
107
13
then
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
saved
them
out
of
their
distresses
107
14
he
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
and
brake
their
bands
in
sunder
107
15
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
107
16
for
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
brass
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
sunder
107
17
fools
because
of
their
transgression
and
because
of
their
iniquities
are
afflicted
107
18
their
soul
abhorreth
all
manner
of
meat
and
they
draw
near
unto
the
gates
of
death
107
19
then
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
saveth
them
out
of
their
distresses
107
20
he
sent
his
word
and
healed
them
and
delivered
them
from
their
destructions
107
21
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
107
22
and
let
them
sacrifice
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving
and
declare
his
works
with
rejoicing
107
23
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
that
do
business
in
great
waters
107
24
these
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
107
25
for
he
commandeth
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
thereof
107
26
they
mount
up
to
the
heaven
they
go
down
again
to
the
depths
their
soul
is
melted
because
of
trouble
107
27
they
reel
to
and
fro
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
and
are
at
their
wit’s
end
107
28
then
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
bringeth
them
out
of
their
distresses
107
29
he
maketh
the
storm
a
calm
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
still
107
30
then
are
they
glad
because
they
be
quiet
so
he
bringeth
them
unto
their
desired
haven
107
31
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
107
32
let
them
exalt
him
also
in
the
congregation
of
the
people
and
praise
him
in
the
assembly
of
the
elders
107
33
he
turneth
rivers
into
a
wilderness
and
the
watersprings
into
dry
ground
107
34
a
fruitful
land
into
barrenness
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein
107
35
he
turneth
the
wilderness
into
a
standing
water
and
dry
ground
into
watersprings
107
36
and
there
he
maketh
the
hungry
to
dwell
that
they
may
prepare
a
city
for
habitation
107
37
and
sow
the
fields
and
plant
vineyards
which
may
yield
fruits
of
increase
107
38
he
blesseth
them
also
so
that
they
are
multiplied
greatly
and
suffereth
not
their
cattle
to
decrease
107
39
again
they
are
minished
and
brought
low
through
oppression
affliction
and
sorrow
107
40
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way
107
41
yet
setteth
he
the
poor
on
high
from
affliction
and
maketh
him
families
like
a
flock
107
42
the
righteous
shall
see
it
and
rejoice
and
all
iniquity
shall
stop
her
mouth
107
43
whoso
is
wise
and
will
observe
these
things
even
they
shall
understand
the
lovingkindness
of

for
the
mouth
of

wicked
and
the
mouth
of
the
deceitful
are
opened
against
me
they
have
spoken
against
me
with
a
lying
tongue
109
3
they
compassed
me
about
also
with
words
of
hatred
and
fought
against
me
without
a
cause
109
4
for
my
love
they
are
my
adversaries
but
i
give
myself
unto
prayer
109
5
and
they
have
rewarded
me
evil
for
good
and
hatred
for
my
love
109
6
set
thou
a
wicked
man
over
him
and
let
satan
stand
at
his
right
hand
109
7
when
he
shall
be
judged
let
him
be
condemned
and
let
his
prayer
become
sin
109
8
let
his
days
be
few
and
let
another
take
his
office
109
9
let
his
children
be
fatherless
and
his
wife
a
widow
109
10
let
his
children
be
continually
vagabonds
and
beg
let
them
seek
their
bread
also
out
of
their
desolate
places
109
11
let
the
extortioner
catch
all
that
he
hath
and
let
the
strangers
spoil
his
labour
109
12
let
there
be
none
to
extend
mercy
unto
him
neither
let
there
be
any
to
favour
his
fatherless
children
109
13
let
his
posterity
be
cut
off
and
in
the
generation
following
let
their
name
be
blotted
out
109
14
let
the
iniquity
of
his
fathers
be
remembered
with
the
lord
and
let
not
the
sin
of
his
mother
be
blotted
out
109
15
let
them
be
before
the
lord
continually
that
he
may
cut
off
the
memory
of
them
from
the
earth
109
16
because
that
he
remembered
not
to
shew
mercy
but
persecuted
the
poor
and
needy
man
that
he
might
even
slay
the
broken
in
heart
109
17
as
he
loved
cursing
so
let
it
come
unto
him
as
he
delighted
not
in
blessing
so
let
it
be
far
from
him
109
18
as
he
clothed
himself
with
cursing
like
as
with
his
garment
so
let
it
come
into
his
bowels
like
water
and
like
oil
into
his
bones
109
19
let
it
be
unto
him
as
the
garment
which
covereth
him
and
for
a
girdle
wherewith
he
is
girded
continually
109
20
let
this
be
the
reward
of
mine
adversaries
from
the
lord
and
of
them
that
speak
evil
against
my
soul
109
21
but
do
thou
for
me
o
god
the
lord
for
thy
name’s
sake
because
thy
mercy
is
good
deliver
thou
me
109
22
for
i
am
poor
and
needy
and
my
heart
is
wounded
within
me
109
23
i
am
gone
like
the
shadow
when
it
declineth
i
am
tossed
up
and
down
as
the
locust
109
24
my
knees
are
weak
through
fasting
and
my
flesh
faileth
of
fatness
109
25
i
became
also
a
reproach
unto
them
when
they
looked
upon
me
they
shaked
their
heads
109
26
help
me
o
lord
my
god
o
save
me
according
to
thy
mercy
109
27
that
they
may
know
that
this
is
thy
hand
that
thou
lord
hast
done
it
109
28
let
them
curse
but
bless
thou
when
they
arise
let
them
be
ashamed
but
let
thy
servant
rejoice
109
29
let
mine
adversaries
be
clothed
with
shame
and
let
them
cover
themselves
with
their
own
confusion
as
with
a
mantle
109
30
i
will
greatly
praise
the
lord
with
my
mouth
yea
i
will
praise
him
among
the
multitude
109
31
for
he
shall
stand
at
the
right
hand
of
the
poor
to
save
him
from
those
that
condemn
his
soul
110
1
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
110
2
the
lord
shall
send
the
rod
of
thy
strength
out
of
zion
rule
thou
in
the
midst
of
thine
enemies
110

thy
people

day
of
thy
power

the
beauties
of
holiness
from
the
womb
of
the
morning
thou
hast
the
dew
of
thy
youth
110

sworn
and

not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
110
5
the
lord
at
thy
right
hand
shall
strike
through
kings
in
the
day
of
his
wrath
110
6
he
shall
judge
among
the
heathen
he
shall
fill
the
places
with
the
dead
bodies
he
shall
wound
the
heads
over
many
countries
110
7
he
shall
drink
of
the
brook
in
the
way
therefore
shall
he
lift
up
the
head

ye
the

the
lord

my
whole
heart
in

assembly
of
the

works
of
the
lord

pleasure
therein

his
work

power
of
his
works
that
he
may

them
the
heritage
of
the
heathen

will
meditate
in
thy
statutes
119
49
remember
the
word
unto
thy
servant
upon
which
thou
hast
caused
me
to
hope
119
50
this
is
my
comfort
in
my
affliction
for
thy
word
hath
quickened
me
119
51
the
proud
have
had
me
greatly
in
derision
yet
have
i
not
declined
from
thy
law
119
52
i
remembered
thy
judgments
of
old
o
lord
and
have
comforted
myself
119
53
horror
hath
taken
hold
upon
me
because
of
the
wicked
that
forsake
thy
law
119
54
thy
statutes
have
been
my
songs
in
the
house
of
my
pilgrimage
119
55
i
have
remembered
thy
name
o
lord
in
the
night
and
have
kept
thy
law
119
56
this
i
had
because
i
kept
thy
precepts
119
57
thou
art
my
portion
o
lord
i
have
said
that
i
would
keep
thy
words
119
58
i
intreated
thy
favour
with
my
whole
heart
be
merciful
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
119
59
i
thought
on
my
ways
and
turned
my
feet
unto
thy
testimonies
119
60
i
made
haste
and
delayed
not
to
keep
thy
commandments
119
61
the
bands
of
the
wicked
have
robbed
me
but
i
have
not
forgotten
thy
law
119
62
at
midnight
i
will
rise
to
give
thanks
unto
thee
because
of
thy
righteous
judgments
119
63
i
am
a
companion
of
all
them
that
fear
thee
and
of
them
that
keep
thy
precepts
119
64
the
earth
o
lord
is
full
of
thy
mercy
teach
me
thy
statutes
119
65
thou
hast
dealt
well
with
thy
servant
o
lord
according
unto
thy
word
119
66
teach
me
good
judgment
and
knowledge
for
i
have
believed
thy
commandments
119
67
before
i
was
afflicted
i
went
astray
but
now
have
i
kept
thy
word
119
68
thou
art
good
and
doest
good
teach
me
thy
statutes
119
69
the
proud
have
forged
a
lie
against
me
but
i
will
keep
thy
precepts
with
my
whole
heart
119
70
their
heart
is
as
fat
as
grease
but
i
delight
in
thy
law
119
71
it
is
good
for
me
that
i
have
been
afflicted
that
i
might
learn
thy
statutes
119
72
the
law
of
thy
mouth
is
better
unto
me
than
thousands
of
gold
and
silver
119
73
thy
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me
give
me
understanding
that
i
may
learn
thy
commandments
119
74
they
that
fear
thee
will
be
glad
when
they
see
me
because
i
have
hoped
in
thy
word
119
75
i
know
o
lord
that
thy
judgments
are
right
and
that
thou
in
faithfulness
hast
afflicted
me
119
76
let
i
pray
thee
thy
merciful
kindness
be
for
my
comfort
according
to
thy
word
unto
thy
servant
119
77
let
thy
tender
mercies
come
unto
me
that
i
may
live
for
thy
law
is
my
delight
119
78
let
the
proud
be
ashamed
for
they
dealt
perversely
with
me
without
a
cause
but
i
will
meditate
in
thy
precepts
119
79
let
those
that
fear
thee
turn
unto
me
and
those
that
have
known
thy
testimonies
119
80
let
my
heart
be
sound
in
thy
statutes
that
i
be
not
ashamed
119
81
my
soul
fainteth
for
thy
salvation
but
i
hope
in
thy
word
119
82
mine
eyes
fail
for
thy
word
saying
when
wilt
thou
comfort
me
119
83
for
i
am
become
like
a
bottle
in
the
smoke
yet
do
i
not
forget
thy
statutes
119
84
how
many
are
the
days
of
thy
servant
when
wilt
thou
execute
judgment
on
them
that
persecute
me
119
85
the
proud
have
digged
pits
for
me
which
are
not
after
thy
law
119
86
all
thy
commandments
are
faithful
they
persecute
me
wrongfully
help
thou
me
119
87
they
had
almost
consumed
me
upon
earth
but
i
forsook
not
thy
precepts
119
88
quicken
me
after
thy
lovingkindness
so
shall
i
keep
the
testimony
of
thy
mouth
119
89
for
ever
o
lord
thy
word
is
settled
in
heaven
119
90
thy
faithfulness
is
unto
all
generations
thou
hast
established
the
earth
and
it
abideth
119
91
they
continue
this
day
according
to
thine
ordinances
for
all
are
thy
servants
119
92
unless
thy
law
had
been
my
delights
i
should
then
have
perished
in
mine
affliction
119
93
i
will
never
forget
thy
precepts
for
with
them
thou
hast
quickened
me
119
94
i
am
thine
save
me
for
i
have
sought
thy
precepts
119
95
the
wicked
have
waited
for
me
to
destroy
me
but
i
will
consider
thy
testimonies
119
96
i
have
seen
an
end
of
all
perfection
but
thy
commandment
is
exceeding
broad
119
97
o
how
i
love
thy
law
it
is
my
meditation
all
the
day
119
98
thou
through
thy
commandments
hast
made
me
wiser
than
mine
enemies
for
they
are
ever
with
me
119
99
i
have
more
understanding
than
all
my
teachers
for
thy
testimonies
are
my
meditation
119
100
i
understand
more
than
the
ancients
because
i
keep
thy
precepts
119
101
i
have
refrained
my
feet
from
every
evil
way
that
i
might
keep
thy
word
119
102
i
have
not
departed
from
thy
judgments
for
thou
hast
taught
me
119
103
how
sweet
are
thy
words
unto
my
taste
yea
sweeter
than
honey
to
my
mouth
119
104
through
thy
precepts
i
get
understanding
therefore
i
hate
every
false
way
119
105
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
119
106
i
have
sworn
and
i
will
perform
it
that
i
will
keep
thy
righteous
judgments
119
107
i
am
afflicted
very
much
quicken
me
o
lord
according
unto
thy
word
119
108
accept
i
beseech
thee
the
freewill
offerings
of
my
mouth
o
lord
and
teach
me
thy
judgments
119
109
my
soul
is
continually
in
my
hand
yet
do
i
not
forget
thy
law
119
110
the
wicked
have
laid
a
snare
for
me
yet
i
erred
not
from
thy
precepts
119
111
thy
testimonies
have
i
taken
as
an
heritage
for
ever
for
they
are
the
rejoicing
of
my
heart
119
112
i
have
inclined
mine
heart
to
perform
thy
statutes
alway
even
unto
the
end
119
113
i
hate
vain
thoughts
but
thy
law
do
i
love
119
114
thou
art
my
hiding
place
and
my
shield
i
hope
in
thy
word
119
115
depart
from
me
ye
evildoers
for
i
will
keep
the
commandments
of
my
god
119
116
uphold
me
according
unto
thy
word
that
i
may
live
and
let
me
not
be
ashamed
of
my
hope
119
117
hold
thou
me
up
and
i
shall
be
safe
and
i
will
have
respect
unto
thy
statutes
continually
119
118
thou
hast
trodden
down
all
them
that
err
from
thy
statutes
for
their
deceit
is
falsehood
119
119
thou
puttest
away
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
like
dross
therefore
i
love
thy
testimonies
119
120
my
flesh
trembleth
for
fear
of
thee
and
i
am
afraid
of
thy
judgments
119
121
i
have
done
judgment
and
justice
leave
me
not
to
mine
oppressors
119
122
be
surety
for
thy
servant
for
good
let
not
the
proud
oppress
me
119
123
mine
eyes
fail
for
thy
salvation
and
for
the
word
of
thy
righteousness
119
124
deal
with
thy
servant
according
unto
thy
mercy
and
teach
me
thy
statutes
119
125
i
am
thy
servant
give
me
understanding
that
i
may
know
thy
testimonies
119
126
it
is
time
for
thee
lord
to
work
for
they
have
made
void
thy
law
119
127
therefore
i
love
thy
commandments
above
gold
yea
above
fine
gold
119
128
therefore
i
esteem
all
thy
precepts
concerning
all
things
to
be
right
and
i
hate
every
false
way
119
129
thy
testimonies
are
wonderful
therefore
doth
my
soul
keep
them
119
130
the
entrance
of
thy
words
giveth
light
it
giveth
understanding
unto
the
simple
119
131
i
opened
my
mouth
and
panted
for
i
longed
for
thy
commandments
119
132
look
thou
upon
me
and
be
merciful
unto
me
as
thou
usest
to
do
unto
those
that
love
thy
name
119
133
order
my
steps
in
thy
word
and
let
not
any
iniquity
have
dominion
over
me
119
134
deliver
me
from
the
oppression
of
man
so
will
i
keep
thy
precepts
119
135
make
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
servant
and
teach
me
thy
statutes
119
136
rivers
of
waters
run
down
mine
eyes
because
they
keep
not
thy
law
119
137
righteous
art
thou
o
lord
and
upright
are
thy
judgments
119
138
thy
testimonies
that
thou
hast
commanded
are
righteous
and
very
faithful
119
139
my
zeal
hath
consumed
me
because
mine
enemies
have
forgotten
thy
words
119
140
thy
word
is
very
pure
therefore
thy
servant
loveth
it
119
141
i
am
small
and
despised
yet
do
not
i
forget
thy
precepts
119
142

righteousness
is
an
everlasting
righteousness
and
thy
law
is
the
truth

trouble
and
anguish
have
taken
hold
on
me

commandments
are
my
delights

144
the
righteousness
of
thy
testimonies
is
everlasting

me
understanding
and
i
shall
live
119
145
i
cried
with
my
whole
heart

me
o
lord
i
will
keep
thy
statutes
119
146
i
cried
unto
thee
save
me
and
i
shall
keep
thy
testimonies
119
147
i
prevented
the
dawning
of
the
morning
and
cried
i
hoped
in
thy
word
119
148
mine
eyes
prevent
the
night
watches
that

might
meditate
in
thy
word
119
149
hear

voice
according
unto
thy
lovingkindness

151
thou
art
near
o
lord
and
all
thy
commandments
are
truth
119

according
to
thy
word

statutes
119
156
great
are
thy
tender
mercies
o
lord
quicken
me
according
to
thy
judgments

my
persecutors

have
hoped
for
thy
salvation
and
done
thy
commandments

law
is
my
delight

175
let
my
soul
live
and
it
shall
praise
thee
and
let
thy
judgments
help
me
119
176
i
have
gone
astray
like
a
lost
sheep
seek
thy
servant
for
i
do
not
forget
thy
commandments
120
1
in
my
distress
i
cried
unto
the
lord
and
he
heard
me
120
2
deliver
my
soul
o
lord
from
lying
lips
and
from
a
deceitful
tongue
120
3
what

be
given
unto
thee
or
what
shall
be
done
unto
thee
thou
false
tongue
120
4
sharp
arrows
of
the
mighty
with
coals
of
juniper
120
5
woe
is
me
that
i
sojourn
in
mesech
that
i
dwell
in
the
tents
of
kedar
120
6
my
soul
hath
long
dwelt
with
him
that
hateth
peace
120
7
i
am
for
peace
but
when
i
speak
they
are
for
war
121
1
i
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
121
2
my
help
cometh
from
the
lord
which
made
heaven
and
earth
121
3
he
will
not
suffer
thy
foot
to
be
moved
he
that
keepeth
thee
will
not
slumber
121
4
behold
he
that
keepeth
israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
sleep
121
5
the
lord

thy
keeper

lord
is
thy
shade
upon
thy
right
hand
121

not
smite
thee
by
day
nor
the
moon
by
night
121
7
the
lord
shall
preserve
thee
from
all
evil
he
shall
preserve
thy
soul
121
8
the
lord
shall
preserve
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
from
this
time
forth
and
even
for
evermore
122
1
i
was
glad
when
they
said
unto
me
let
us
go
into
the
house
of
the
lord
122
2
our
feet
shall
stand
within
thy
gates
o
jerusalem
122
3
jerusalem
is
builded
as
a
city
that
is
compact
together
122
4
whither
the
tribes
go
up
the
tribes
of
the
lord
unto
the
testimony
of
israel
to
give
thanks
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
122
5
for
there
are
set
thrones
of
judgment
the
thrones
of
the
house
of
david
122
6
pray
for
the
peace
of
jerusalem
they
shall
prosper
that

8
for
my
brethren
and
companions’
sakes
i
will
now
say
peace
be
within
thee
122
9
because
of
the
house
of
the
lord
our
god
i
will
seek
thy
good
123
1
unto
thee
lift
i
up
mine
eyes
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
heavens
123
2
behold
as
the
eyes
of
servants
look
unto
the
hand
of
their
masters
and
as
the
eyes
of
a
maiden
unto
the
hand
of
her
mistress
so
our
eyes
wait
upon
the
lord
our
god
until
that
he
have
mercy
upon
us
123
3
have
mercy
upon
us
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
for
we
are
exceedingly
filled
with
contempt
123
4
our
soul
is
exceedingly
filled
with
the
scorning
of
those
that
are
at
ease
and
with
the
contempt
of
the
proud
124
1
if
it
had
not
been
the
lord
who
was
on
our
side
now
may
israel
say
124
2
if
it
had
not
been
the
lord
who
was
on
our
side
when
men
rose
up
against
us
124
3
then
they
had
swallowed
us
up
quick
when
their
wrath
was
kindled
against
us
124
4
then
the
waters
had
overwhelmed
us
the
stream
had
gone
over
our
soul
124
5
then
the
proud
waters
had
gone
over
our
soul
124
6
blessed
be
the
lord
who
hath
not
given
us
as
a
prey
to
their
teeth
124
7
our
soul
is
escaped
as
a
bird
out
of
the
snare
of
the
fowlers
the
snare
is
broken
and
we
are
escaped
124
8
our
help
is
in
the
name
of
the
lord
who
made
heaven
and
earth
125
1
they
that
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
as
mount
zion
which
cannot
be
removed
but
abideth
for
ever
125
2
as
the
mountains
are
round
about
jerusalem
so
the
lord
is
round
about
his
people
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
125
3
for
the
rod
of
the
wicked
shall
not
rest
upon
the
lot
of
the
righteous
lest
the
righteous
put
forth
their
hands
unto
iniquity
125
4
do
good
o
lord
unto
those
that
be
good
and
to
them
that
are
upright
in
their
hearts
125
5
as
for
such
as
turn
aside
unto
their
crooked
ways
the
lord
shall
lead
them
forth
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
but
peace
shall
be
upon
israel
126
1
when
the
lord
turned
again
the
captivity
of
zion
we
were
like
them
that
dream
126
2
then
was
our
mouth
filled
with
laughter
and
our
tongue
with
singing
then
said
they
among
the
heathen
the
lord
hath
done
great
things
for
them
126
3
the
lord
hath
done
great
things
for
us
whereof
we
are
glad
126
4
turn
again
our
captivity
o
lord
as
the
streams
in
the
south
126
5
they
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy
126
6
he
that
goeth
forth
and
weepeth
bearing
precious
seed
shall
doubtless
come
again
with
rejoicing
bringing
his
sheaves
with
him
127
1
except
the
lord
build
the
house
they
labour
in
vain
that
build
it
except
the
lord
keep
the
city
the
watchman
waketh
but
in
vain
127
2
it
is
vain
for
you
to
rise
up
early
to
sit
up
late
to
eat
the
bread
of
sorrows
for
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
127
3
lo
children
are
an
heritage
of
the
lord
and
the
fruit
of
the
womb
is
his
reward
127
4
as
arrows
are
in
the
hand
of
a
mighty
man
so
are
children
of
the
youth
127
5
happy
is
the
man
that
hath
his
quiver
full
of
them
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
but
they
shall
speak
with
the
enemies
in
the
gate
128
1
blessed
is
every
one
that
feareth
the
lord
that
walketh
in
his
ways
128
2
for
thou
shalt
eat
the
labour
of
thine
hands
happy
shalt
thou
be
and
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
128
3
thy
wife
shall
be
as
a
fruitful
vine
by
the
sides
of
thine
house
thy
children
like
olive
plants
round
about
thy
table
128
4
behold
that
thus
shall
the
man
be
blessed
that
feareth
the
lord
128
5
the
lord
shall
bless
thee
out
of
zion
and
thou
shalt
see
the
good
of
jerusalem
all
the
days
of
thy
life
128
6
yea
thou
shalt
see
thy
children’s
children
and
peace
upon
israel
129
1
many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth
may
israel
now
say
129
2
many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth
yet
they
have
not
prevailed
against
me
129
3
the
plowers
plowed
upon
my
back
they
made
long
their
furrows
129
4
the
lord
is
righteous
he
hath
cut
asunder
the
cords
of
the
wicked
129
5
let
them
all
be
confounded
and
turned
back
that
hate
zion
129
6
let
them
be
as
the
grass
upon
the
housetops
which
withereth
afore
it
groweth
up
129
7
wherewith
the
mower
filleth
not
his
hand
nor
he
that
bindeth
sheaves
his
bosom
129
8
neither
do
they
which
go
by
say
the
blessing
of
the
lord
be
upon
you
we
bless
you
in
the
name
of
the
lord
130
1
out
of
the
depths
have
i
cried
unto
thee
o
lord
130
2
lord
hear
my
voice
let
thine
ears
be
attentive
to
the
voice
of
my
supplications
130
3
if
thou
lord
shouldest
mark
iniquities
o
lord
who
shall
stand
130
4
but
there
is
forgiveness
with
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
feared
130
5
i
wait
for
the
lord
my
soul
doth
wait
and
in
his
word
do
i
hope
130
6
my
soul
waiteth
for
the
lord
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning
i
say
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning
130
7
let
israel
hope
in
the
lord
for
with
the
lord
there
is
mercy
and
with
him
is
plenteous
redemption
130
8
and
he
shall
redeem
israel
from
all
his
iniquities
131
1
lord
my
heart
is
not
haughty
nor
mine
eyes
lofty
neither
do
i
exercise
myself
in
great
matters
or
in
things
too
high
for
me
131
2
surely
i
have
behaved
and
quieted
myself
as
a
child
that
is
weaned
of
his
mother
my
soul
is
even
as
a
weaned
child
131
3
let
israel
hope
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
and
for
ever
132
1
lord
remember
david
and
all
his
afflictions
132
2
how
he
sware
unto
the
lord
and
vowed
unto
the
mighty
god
of
jacob
132
3
surely
i
will
not
come
into
the
tabernacle
of
my
house
nor
go
up
into
my
bed
132
4
i
will
not
give
sleep
to
mine
eyes
or
slumber
to
mine
eyelids
132
5
until
i
find
out
a
place
for
the
lord
an
habitation
for
the
mighty
god
of
jacob
132
6
lo
we
heard
of
it
at
ephratah
we
found
it
in
the
fields
of
the
wood
132
7
we
will
go
into
his
tabernacles
we
will
worship
at
his
footstool
132
8
arise
o
lord
into
thy
rest
thou
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength
132
9
let
thy
priests
be
clothed
with
righteousness
and
let
thy
saints
shout
for
joy
132
10
for
thy
servant
david’s
sake
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed
132
11
the
lord
hath
sworn
in
truth
unto
david
he
will
not
turn
from
it
of
the
fruit
of
thy
body
will
i
set
upon
thy
throne
132
12
if
thy
children
will
keep
my
covenant
and
my
testimony
that
i
shall
teach
them
their
children
shall
also
sit
upon
thy
throne
for
evermore
132
13
for
the
lord
hath
chosen
zion
he
hath
desired
it
for
his
habitation
132
14
this
is
my
rest
for
ever
here
will
i
dwell
for
i
have
desired
it
132
15
i
will
abundantly
bless
her
provision
i
will
satisfy
her
poor
with
bread
132
16
i
will
also
clothe
her
priests
with
salvation
and
her
saints
shall
shout
aloud
for
joy
132
17
there
will
i
make
the
horn
of
david
to
bud
i
have
ordained
a
lamp
for
mine
anointed
132
18
his
enemies
will
i
clothe
with
shame
but
upon
himself
shall
his
crown
flourish
133
1
behold
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity
133
2
it
is
like
the
precious
ointment
upon
the
head
that
ran
down
upon
the
beard
even
aaron’s
beard
that
went
down
to
the
skirts
of
his
garments
133
3
as
the
dew
of
hermon
and
as
the
dew
that
descended
upon
the
mountains
of
zion
for

the
lord
commanded
the
blessing

for

by

there
we

down

we
remembered
zion
137
2
we
hanged
our
harps
upon
the
willows
in
the
midst
thereof
137
3
for
there
they
that
carried
us
away
captive
required
of
us
a
song
and
they
that
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
zion
137
4
how
shall
we
sing
the
lord’s
song
in
a
strange

if
i

remember
thee

jerusalem
above
my
chief
joy

the

rase
it
rase
it

thereof
137
8
o
daughter
of
babylon
who
art
to

destroyed
happy
shall
he
be
that

thee
as
thou

us
137
9
happy

i
will
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple

thy
truth
for
thou
hast
magnified
thy
word
above
all
thy
name
138
3
in
the
day
when
i
cried
thou
answeredst
me
and
strengthenedst
me
with
strength
in
my
soul
138
4
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
shall

thee
o

sing
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
for
great
is
the
glory
of
the
lord
138
6
though
the
lord
be
high
yet
hath
he
respect
unto
the
lowly
but
the
proud
he
knoweth
afar
off
138
7
though
i
walk
in
the
midst
of
trouble
thou
wilt
revive
me
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thine
hand
against
the
wrath
of
mine
enemies
and
thy
right
hand
shall
save
me
138
8
the
lord
will
perfect
that
which
concerneth
me
thy
mercy
o
lord
endureth
for
ever
forsake
not
the
works
of
thine
own
hands
139
1
o
lord
thou
hast
searched
me
and
known
me
139
2
thou
knowest
my
downsitting
and
mine
uprising
thou
understandest
my
thought
afar
off
139
3
thou
compassest
my
path
and
my
lying
down
and
art
acquainted
with
all
my
ways
139
4
for
there
is
not
a
word
in
my
tongue
but
lo
o
lord
thou
knowest
it
altogether
139
5
thou
hast
beset
me
behind
and
before
and
laid
thine
hand
upon
me
139
6
such
knowledge
is
too
wonderful
for
me
it
is
high
i
cannot
attain
unto
it
139
7
whither
shall
i
go
from
thy
spirit
or
whither
shall
i
flee
from
thy
presence
139
8
if
i
ascend
up
into
heaven
thou
art
there
if
i
make
my
bed
in
hell
behold
thou
art
there
139
9
if
i
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
139
10
even
there
shall
thy
hand
lead
me
and
thy
right
hand
shall
hold
me
139
11
if
i
say
surely
the
darkness
shall
cover
me
even
the
night
shall
be
light
about
me
139
12
yea
the
darkness
hideth
not
from
thee
but
the
night
shineth
as
the
day
the
darkness
and
the
light
are
both
alike
to
thee
139
13
for
thou
hast
possessed
my
reins
thou
hast
covered
me
in
my
mother’s
womb
139
14
i
will
praise
thee
for
i
am
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
marvellous
are
thy
works
and
that
my
soul
knoweth
right
well
139
15
my
substance
was
not
hid
from
thee
when
i
was
made
in
secret
and
curiously
wrought
in
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
139
16
thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance
yet
being
unperfect
and
in
thy
book
all
my
members
were
written
which
in
continuance
were
fashioned
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them
139
17
how
precious
also
are
thy
thoughts
unto
me
o
god
how
great
is
the
sum
of
them
139
18
if
i
should
count
them
they
are
more
in
number
than
the
sand
when
i
awake
i
am
still
with
thee
139
19
surely
thou
wilt
slay
the
wicked
o
god
depart
from
me
therefore
ye
bloody
men
139
20
for
they
speak
against
thee
wickedly
and
thine
enemies
take
thy
name
in
vain
139
21
do
not
i
hate
them
o
lord
that
hate
thee
and
am
not
i
grieved
with
those
that
rise
up
against
thee
139

them
with
perfect
hatred
i
count
them
mine
enemies

i
poured
out
my
complaint
before

i
shewed
before
him
my
trouble
142
3
when
my
spirit
was
overwhelmed
within
me
then
thou
knewest
my
path
in
the
way
wherein
i
walked
have
they
privily
laid
a
snare
for
me
142

to

justice

to
give

to
the

to
the
young
man
knowledge
and
discretion
1
5
a
wise
man
will
hear
and
will
increase
learning
and
a
man
of
understanding
shall
attain
unto
wise
counsels
1
6
to
understand
a
proverb
and
the
interpretation
the
words
of
the
wise
and
their
dark
sayings
1
7
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
knowledge
but
fools
despise
wisdom
and
instruction
1
8
my
son
hear
the
instruction
of
thy
father
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother
1
9
for
they
shall
be
an
ornament
of
grace
unto
thy
head
and
chains
about
thy
neck
1
10
my
son
if
sinners
entice
thee
consent
thou
not
1
11
if
they
say
come
with
us
let
us
lay
wait
for
blood
let
us
lurk
privily
for
the
innocent
without
cause
1
12
let
us
swallow
them
up
alive
as
the
grave
and
whole
as
those
that
go
down
into
the
pit
1
13
we
shall
find
all
precious
substance
we
shall
fill
our
houses
with
spoil
1
14
cast
in
thy
lot
among
us
let
us
all
have
one
purse
1
15
my
son
walk
not
thou
in
the
way
with
them
refrain
thy
foot
from
their
path
1
16
for
their
feet
run
to
evil
and
make
haste
to
shed
blood
1
17
surely
in
vain
the
net
is
spread
in
the
sight
of
any
bird
1
18
and
they
lay
wait
for
their
own
blood
they
lurk
privily
for
their
own
lives
1
19
so
are
the
ways
of
every
one
that
is
greedy
of
gain
which
taketh
away
the
life
of
the
owners
thereof
1
20
wisdom
crieth
without
she
uttereth
her
voice
in
the
streets
1
21
she
crieth
in
the
chief
place
of
concourse
in
the
openings
of
the
gates
in
the
city
she
uttereth
her
words
saying
1
22
how
long
ye
simple
ones
will
ye
love
simplicity
and
the
scorners
delight
in
their
scorning
and
fools
hate
knowledge
1
23
turn
you
at
my
reproof
behold
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
unto
you
i
will
make
known
my
words
unto
you
1
24
because
i
have
called
and
ye
refused
i
have
stretched
out
my
hand
and
no
man
regarded
1
25
but
ye
have
set
at
nought
all
my
counsel
and
would
none
of
my
reproof
1
26
i
also
will
laugh
at
your
calamity
i
will
mock
when
your
fear
cometh
1
27
when
your
fear
cometh
as
desolation
and
your
destruction
cometh
as
a
whirlwind
when
distress
and
anguish
cometh
upon
you
1
28
then
shall
they
call
upon
me
but
i
will
not
answer
they
shall
seek
me
early
but
they
shall
not
find
me
1
29
for
that
they
hated
knowledge
and
did
not
choose
the
fear
of
the
lord
1
30
they
would
none
of
my
counsel
they
despised
all
my
reproof
1
31
therefore
shall
they
eat
of
the
fruit
of
their
own
way
and
be
filled
with
their
own
devices
1
32
for
the
turning
away
of
the
simple
shall
slay
them
and
the
prosperity
of
fools
shall
destroy
them
1
33
but
whoso
hearkeneth
unto
me
shall
dwell
safely
and
shall
be
quiet
from
fear
of
evil
2
1
my
son
if
thou
wilt
receive
my
words
and
hide
my
commandments
with
thee
2
2
so
that
thou
incline
thine
ear
unto
wisdom
and
apply
thine
heart
to
understanding
2
3
yea
if
thou
criest
after
knowledge
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding
2
4
if
thou
seekest
her
as
silver
and
searchest
for
her
as
for
hid
treasures
2
5
then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
find
the
knowledge
of
god
2
6
for
the
lord
giveth
wisdom
out
of
his
mouth
cometh
knowledge
and
understanding
2
7
he
layeth
up
sound
wisdom
for
the
righteous
he
is
a
buckler
to
them
that
walk
uprightly
2
8
he
keepeth
the
paths
of
judgment
and
preserveth
the
way
of
his
saints
2
9
then
shalt
thou
understand
righteousness
and
judgment
and
equity
yea
every
good
path
2
10
when
wisdom
entereth
into
thine
heart
and
knowledge
is
pleasant
unto
thy
soul
2
11
discretion
shall
preserve
thee
understanding
shall
keep
thee
2
12
to
deliver
thee
from
the
way
of
the
evil
man
from
the
man
that
speaketh
froward
things
2
13
who
leave
the
paths
of
uprightness
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
darkness
2
14
who
rejoice
to
do
evil
and
delight
in
the
frowardness
of
the
wicked
2
15
whose
ways
are
crooked
and
they
froward
in
their
paths
2
16
to
deliver
thee
from
the
strange
woman
even
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words
2
17
which
forsaketh
the
guide
of
her
youth
and
forgetteth
the
covenant
of
her
god
2
18
for
her
house
inclineth
unto
death
and
her
paths
unto
the
dead
2
19
none
that
go
unto
her
return
again
neither
take
they
hold
of
the
paths
of
life
2
20
that
thou
mayest
walk
in
the
way
of
good
men
and
keep
the
paths
of
the
righteous
2
21
for
the
upright
shall
dwell
in
the
land
and
the
perfect
shall
remain
in
it
2
22
but
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
earth
and
the
transgressors
shall
be
rooted
out
of
it
3
1
my
son
forget
not
my
law
but
let
thine
heart
keep
my
commandments
3
2
for
length
of
days
and
long
life
and
peace
shall
they
add
to
thee
3
3
let
not
mercy
and
truth
forsake
thee
bind
them
about
thy
neck
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart
3
4
so
shalt
thou
find
favour
and
good
understanding
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
3
5
trust
in
the
lord
with
all
thine
heart
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understanding
3
6
in
all
thy
ways
acknowledge
him
and
he
shall
direct
thy
paths
3
7
be
not
wise
in
thine
own
eyes
fear
the
lord
and
depart
from
evil
3
8
it
shall
be
health
to
thy
navel
and
marrow
to
thy
bones
3
9
honour
the
lord
with
thy
substance
and
with
the
firstfruits
of
all
thine
increase
3
10
so
shall
thy
barns
be
filled
with
plenty
and
thy
presses
shall
burst
out
with
new
wine
3
11
my
son
despise
not
the
chastening
of
the
lord
neither
be
weary
of
his
correction
3
12
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
correcteth
even
as
a
father
the
son
in
whom
he
delighteth
3
13
happy
is
the
man
that
findeth
wisdom
and
the
man
that
getteth
understanding
3
14
for
the
merchandise
of
it
is
better
than
the
merchandise
of
silver
and
the
gain
thereof
than
fine
gold
3
15
she
is
more
precious
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
thou
canst
desire
are
not
to
be
compared
unto
her
3
16
length
of
days
is
in
her
right
hand
and
in
her
left
hand
riches
and
honour
3
17
her
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
3
18
she
is
a
tree
of
life
to
them
that
lay
hold
upon
her
and
happy
is
every
one
that
retaineth
her
3
19
the
lord
by
wisdom
hath
founded
the
earth
by
understanding
hath
he
established
the
heavens
3
20
by
his
knowledge
the
depths
are
broken
up
and
the
clouds
drop
down
the
dew
3
21
my
son
let
not
them
depart
from
thine
eyes
keep
sound
wisdom
and
discretion
3
22
so
shall
they
be
life
unto
thy
soul
and
grace
to
thy
neck
3
23
then
shalt
thou
walk
in
thy
way
safely
and
thy
foot
shall
not
stumble
3
24
when
thou
liest
down
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
yea
thou
shalt
lie
down
and
thy
sleep
shall
be
sweet
3
25
be
not
afraid
of
sudden
fear
neither
of
the
desolation
of
the
wicked
when
it
cometh
3
26
for
the
lord
shall
be
thy
confidence
and
shall
keep
thy
foot
from
being
taken
3
27
withhold
not
good
from
them
to
whom
it
is
due
when
it
is
in
the
power
of
thine
hand
to
do
it
3
28
say
not
unto
thy
neighbour
go
and
come
again
and
to
morrow
i
will
give
when
thou
hast
it
by
thee
3
29
devise
not
evil
against
thy
neighbour
seeing
he
dwelleth
securely
by
thee
3
30
strive
not
with
a
man
without
cause
if
he
have
done
thee
no
harm
3
31
envy
thou
not
the
oppressor
and
choose
none
of
his
ways
3
32
for
the
froward
is
abomination
to
the
lord
but
his
secret
is
with
the
righteous
3
33
the
curse
of
the
lord
is
in
the
house
of
the
wicked
but
he
blesseth
the
habitation
of
the
just
3
34
surely
he
scorneth
the
scorners
but
he
giveth
grace
unto
the
lowly
3
35
the
wise
shall
inherit
glory
but
shame
shall
be
the
promotion
of
fools
4
1
hear
ye
children
the
instruction
of
a
father
and
attend
to
know
understanding
4
2
for
i
give
you
good
doctrine
forsake
ye
not
my
law
4
3
for
i
was
my
father’s
son
tender
and
only
beloved
in
the
sight
of
my
mother
4
4
he
taught
me
also
and
said
unto
me
let
thine
heart
retain
my
words
keep
my
commandments
and
live
4
5
get
wisdom

understanding
forget
it
not
neither
decline
from
the
words
of
my
mouth
4
6
forsake
her
not
and
she
shall
preserve
thee
love
her
and
she
shall
keep
thee
4
7
wisdom
is
the
principal
thing
therefore
get
wisdom
and
with
all
thy
getting
get
understanding
4
8
exalt
her
and
she
shall
promote
thee
she
shall
bring
thee
to
honour
when
thou
dost
embrace
her
4
9
she
shall
give
to
thine
head
an
ornament
of
grace
a
crown
of
glory
shall
she
deliver
to
thee
4
10
hear
o
my
son
and
receive
my
sayings
and
the
years
of
thy
life
shall
be
many
4
11
i
have
taught
thee
in
the
way
of
wisdom
i
have
led
thee
in
right
paths
4
12
when
thou
goest
thy
steps
shall
not
be
straitened
and
when
thou
runnest
thou
shalt
not
stumble
4
13
take
fast
hold
of
instruction
let
her
not
go
keep
her
for
she
is
thy
life
4
14
enter
not
into
the
path
of
the
wicked
and
go
not
in
the
way
of
evil
men
4
15
avoid
it
pass
not
by
it
turn
from
it
and
pass
away
4
16
for
they
sleep
not
except
they
have
done
mischief
and
their
sleep
is
taken
away
unless
they
cause
some
to
fall

17
for
they
eat
the
bread
of
wickedness
and
drink
the
wine
of
violence
4
18
but
the
path
of
the
just
is
as
the
shining
light
that
shineth
more
and
more
unto
the
perfect
day
4
19
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
as
darkness
they
know
not
at
what
they
stumble
4
20
my
son
attend
to
my
words
incline
thine
ear
unto
my
sayings
4
21
let
them
not
depart
from
thine
eyes
keep
them
in
the
midst
of
thine
heart
4
22
for
they
are
life
unto
those
that
find
them
and
health
to
all
their
flesh
4
23
keep
thy
heart
with
all
diligence
for
out
of
it
are
the
issues
of
life
4
24
put
away
from
thee
a
froward
mouth
and
perverse
lips
put
far
from
thee
4
25
let
thine
eyes
look
right
on
and
let
thine
eyelids
look
straight
before
thee
4
26
ponder
the
path
of
thy
feet
and
let
all
thy
ways
be
established
4
27
turn
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
remove
thy
foot
from
evil
5
1
my
son
attend
unto
my
wisdom
and
bow
thine
ear
to
my
understanding
5
2
that
thou
mayest
regard
discretion
and
that
thy
lips
may
keep
knowledge
5
3
for
the
lips
of
a
strange
woman
drop
as
an
honeycomb
and
her
mouth
is
smoother
than
oil
5
4
but
her
end
is
bitter
as
wormwood
sharp
as
a
two-edged
sword
5
5
her
feet
go
down
to
death
her
steps
take
hold
on
hell
5
6
lest
thou
shouldest
ponder
the
path
of
life
her
ways
are
moveable
that
thou
canst
not
know
them
5
7
hear
me
now
therefore
o
ye
children
and
depart
not
from
the
words
of
my
mouth
5
8
remove
thy
way
far
from
her
and
come
not
nigh
the
door
of
her
house
5
9
lest
thou
give
thine
honour
unto
others
and
thy
years
unto
the
cruel
5
10
lest
strangers
be
filled
with
thy
wealth
and
thy
labours
be
in
the
house
of
a
stranger
5
11
and
thou
mourn
at
the
last
when
thy
flesh
and
thy
body
are
consumed
5
12
and
say
how
have
i
hated
instruction
and
my
heart
despised
reproof
5
13
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
my
teachers
nor
inclined
mine
ear
to
them
that
instructed
me
5
14
i
was
almost
in
all
evil
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
assembly
5
15
drink
waters
out
of
thine
own
cistern
and
running
waters
out
of
thine
own
well
5
16
let
thy
fountains
be
dispersed
abroad
and
rivers
of
waters
in
the
streets
5
17
let
them
be
only
thine
own
and
not
strangers’
with
thee
5
18
let
thy
fountain
be
blessed
and
rejoice
with
the
wife
of
thy
youth
5
19
let
her
be
as
the
loving
hind
and
pleasant
roe
let
her
breasts
satisfy
thee
at
all
times
and
be
thou
ravished
always
with
her
love
5
20
and
why
wilt
thou
my
son
be
ravished
with
a
strange
woman
and
embrace
the
bosom
of
a
stranger
5
21
for
the
ways
of
man
are
before
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
he
pondereth
all
his
goings
5
22
his
own
iniquities
shall
take
the
wicked
himself
and
he
shall
be
holden
with
the
cords
of
his
sins
5
23
he
shall
die
without
instruction
and
in
the
greatness
of
his
folly
he
shall
go
astray
6
1
my
son
if
thou
be
surety
for
thy
friend
if
thou
hast
stricken
thy
hand
with
a
stranger
6
2
thou
art
snared
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth
thou
art
taken
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth
6
3
do
this
now
my
son
and
deliver
thyself
when
thou
art
come
into
the
hand
of
thy
friend
go
humble
thyself
and
make
sure
thy
friend
6
4
give
not
sleep
to
thine
eyes
nor
slumber
to
thine
eyelids
6
5
deliver
thyself
as
a
roe
from
the
hand
of
the
hunter
and
as
a
bird
from
the
hand
of
the
fowler
6
6
go
to
the
ant
thou
sluggard
consider
her
ways
and
be
wise
6
7
which
having
no
guide
overseer
or
ruler
6
8
provideth
her
meat
in
the
summer
and
gathereth
her
food
in
the
harvest
6
9
how
long
wilt
thou
sleep
o
sluggard
when
wilt
thou
arise
out
of
thy
sleep
6
10
yet
a
little
sleep
a
little
slumber
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep
6
11
so
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man
6
12
a
naughty
person
a
wicked
man
walketh
with
a
froward
mouth
6
13
he
winketh
with
his
eyes
he
speaketh
with
his
feet
he
teacheth
with
his
fingers
6
14
frowardness
is
in
his
heart
he
deviseth
mischief
continually
he
soweth
discord
6
15
therefore
shall
his
calamity
come
suddenly
suddenly
shall
he
be
broken
without
remedy
6
16
these
six
things
doth
the
lord
hate
yea
seven
are
an
abomination
unto
him
6
17
a
proud
look
a
lying
tongue
and
hands
that
shed
innocent
blood
6
18
an
heart
that
deviseth
wicked
imaginations
feet
that
be
swift
in
running
to
mischief
6
19
a
false
witness
that
speaketh
lies
and
he
that
soweth
discord
among
brethren
6
20
my
son
keep
thy
father’s
commandment
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother
6
21
bind
them
continually
upon
thine
heart
and
tie
them
about
thy
neck
6
22
when
thou
goest
it
shall
lead
thee
when
thou
sleepest
it
shall
keep
thee
and
when
thou
awakest
it
shall
talk
with
thee
6
23
for
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
and
the
law
is
light
and
reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
life
6
24
to
keep
thee
from
the
evil
woman
from
the
flattery
of
the
tongue
of
a
strange
woman
6
25
lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
heart
neither
let
her
take
thee
with
her
eyelids
6
26
for
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece
of
bread
and
the
adultress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
life
6
27
can
a
man
take
fire
in
his
bosom
and
his
clothes
not
be
burned
6
28
can
one
go
upon
hot
coals
and
his
feet
not
be
burned
6
29
so
he
that
goeth
in
to
his
neighbour’s
wife
whosoever
toucheth
her
shall
not
be
innocent
6
30
men
do
not
despise
a
thief
if
he
steal
to
satisfy
his
soul
when
he
is
hungry
6
31
but
if
he
be
found
he
shall
restore
sevenfold
he
shall
give
all
the
substance
of
his
house
6
32
but
whoso
committeth
adultery
with
a
woman
lacketh
understanding
he
that
doeth
it
destroyeth
his
own
soul
6
33
a
wound
and
dishonour
shall
he
get
and
his
reproach
shall
not
be
wiped
away
6
34
for
jealousy
is
the
rage
of
a
man
therefore
he
will
not
spare
in
the
day
of
vengeance
6
35
he
will
not
regard
any
ransom
neither
will
he
rest
content
though
thou
givest
many
gifts
7
1
my
son
keep
my
words
and
lay
up
my
commandments
with
thee
7
2
keep
my
commandments
and
live
and
my
law
as
the
apple
of
thine
eye
7
3
bind
them
upon
thy
fingers
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart
7
4
say
unto
wisdom
thou
art
my
sister
and
call
understanding
thy
kinswoman
7
5
that
they
may
keep
thee
from
the
strange
woman
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words
7
6
for
at
the
window
of
my
house
i
looked
through
my
casement
7
7
and
beheld
among
the
simple
ones
i
discerned
among
the
youths
a
young
man
void
of
understanding
7
8
passing
through
the
street
near
her
corner
and
he
went
the
way
to
her
house
7
9
in
the
twilight
in
the
evening
in
the
black
and
dark
night
7
10
and
behold
there
met
him
a
woman
with
the
attire
of
an
harlot
and
subtil
of
heart
7
11
(she
is
loud
and
stubborn
her
feet
abide
not
in
her
house
7
12
now
is
she
without
now
in
the
streets
and
lieth
in
wait
at
every
corner
)
7
13
so
she
caught
him
and
kissed
him
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
him
7
14
i
have
peace
offerings
with
me
this
day
have
i
payed
my
vows
7
15
therefore
came
i
forth
to
meet
thee
diligently
to
seek
thy
face
and
i
have
found
thee
7
16
i
have
decked
my
bed
with
coverings
of
tapestry
with
carved
works
with
fine
linen
of
egypt
7
17
i
have
perfumed
my
bed
with
myrrh
aloes
and
cinnamon
7
18
come
let
us
take
our
fill
of
love
until
the
morning
let
us
solace
ourselves
with
loves
7
19
for
the
goodman
is
not
at
home
he
is
gone
a
long
journey
7
20
he
hath
taken
a
bag
of
money
with
him
and
will
come
home
at
the
day
appointed
7
21
with
her
much
fair
speech
she
caused
him
to
yield
with
the
flattering
of
her
lips
she
forced
him
7
22
he
goeth
after
her
straightway
as
an
ox
goeth
to
the
slaughter
or
as
a
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
stocks
7
23
till
a
dart
strike
through
his
liver
as
a
bird
hasteth
to
the
snare
and
knoweth
not
that
it
is
for
his
life
7
24
hearken
unto
me
now
therefore
o
ye
children
and
attend
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
7
25
let
not
thine
heart
decline
to
her
ways
go
not
astray
in
her
paths
7
26
for
she
hath
cast
down
many
wounded
yea
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
her
7
27
her
house
is
the
way
to
hell
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
death
8
1
doth
not
wisdom
cry
and
understanding
put
forth
her
voice
8
2
she
standeth
in
the
top
of
high
places
by
the
way
in
the
places
of
the
paths
8
3
she
crieth
at
the
gates
at
the
entry
of
the
city
at
the
coming
in
at
the
doors
8
4
unto
you
o
men
i
call
and
my
voice
is
to
the
sons
of
man
8
5
o
ye
simple
understand
wisdom
and
ye
fools
be
ye
of
an
understanding
heart
8
6
hear
for
i
will
speak
of
excellent
things
and
the
opening
of
my
lips
shall
be
right
things
8
7
for
my
mouth
shall
speak
truth
and
wickedness
is
an
abomination
to
my
lips
8
8
all
the
words
of
my
mouth
are
in
righteousness
there
is
nothing
froward
or
perverse
in
them
8
9
they
are
all
plain
to
him
that
understandeth
and
right
to
them
that
find
knowledge
8
10
receive
my
instruction
and
not
silver
and
knowledge
rather
than
choice
gold
8
11
for
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
it
8
12
i
wisdom
dwell
with
prudence
and
find
out
knowledge
of
witty
inventions
8
13
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
to
hate
evil
pride
and
arrogancy
and
the
evil
way
and
the
froward
mouth
do
i
hate
8
14
counsel
is
mine
and
sound
wisdom
i
am
understanding
i
have
strength
8
15
by
me
kings
reign
and
princes
decree
justice
8
16
by
me
princes
rule
and
nobles
even
all
the
judges
of
the
earth
8
17
i
love
them
that
love
me
and
those
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
8
18
riches
and
honour
are
with
me
yea
durable
riches
and
righteousness
8
19
my
fruit
is
better
than
gold
yea
than
fine
gold
and
my
revenue
than
choice
silver
8
20
i
lead
in
the
way
of
righteousness
in
the
midst
of
the
paths
of
judgment
8
21
that
i
may
cause
those
that
love
me
to
inherit
substance
and
i
will
fill
their
treasures
8
22
the
lord
possessed
me
in
the
beginning
of
his
way
before
his
works
of
old
8
23
i
was
set
up
from
everlasting
from
the
beginning
or
ever
the
earth
was
8
24
when
there
were
no
depths
i
was
brought
forth
when
there
were
no
fountains
abounding
with
water
8
25
before
the
mountains
were
settled
before
the
hills
was
i
brought
forth
8
26
while
as
yet
he
had
not
made
the
earth
nor
the
fields
nor
the
highest
part
of
the
dust
of
the
world
8
27
when
he
prepared
the
heavens
i
was
there
when
he
set
a
compass
upon
the
face
of
the
depth
8
28
when
he
established
the
clouds
above
when
he
strengthened
the
fountains
of
the
deep
8
29
when
he
gave
to
the
sea
his
decree
that
the
waters
should
not
pass
his
commandment
when
he
appointed
the
foundations
of
the
earth
8
30
then
i
was
by
him
as
one
brought
up
with
him
and
i
was
daily
his
delight
rejoicing
always
before
him
8
31
rejoicing
in
the
habitable
part
of
his
earth
and
my
delights
were
with
the
sons
of
men
8
32
now
therefore
hearken
unto
me
o
ye
children
for
blessed
are
they
that
keep
my
ways
8
33
hear
instruction
and
be
wise
and
refuse
it
not
8
34
blessed
is
the
man
that
heareth
me
watching
daily
at
my
gates
waiting
at
the
posts
of
my
doors
8
35
for
whoso
findeth
me
findeth
life
and
shall
obtain
favour
of
the
lord
8
36
but
he
that
sinneth
against
me
wrongeth
his
own
soul
all
they
that
hate
me
love
death
9
1
wisdom
hath
builded
her
house
she
hath
hewn
out
her
seven
pillars
9
2
she
hath
killed
her
beasts
she
hath
mingled
her
wine
she
hath
also
furnished
her
table
9
3
she
hath
sent
forth
her
maidens
she
crieth
upon
the
highest
places
of
the
city
9
4
whoso
is
simple
let
him
turn
in
hither
as
for
him
that
wanteth
understanding
she
saith
to
him
9
5
come
eat
of
my
bread
and
drink
of
the
wine
which
i
have
mingled
9
6
forsake
the
foolish
and
live
and
go
in
the
way
of
understanding
9
7
he
that
reproveth
a
scorner
getteth
to
himself
shame
and
he
that
rebuketh
a
wicked
man
getteth
himself
a
blot
9
8
reprove
not
a
scorner
lest
he
hate
thee
rebuke
a
wise
man
and
he
will
love
thee
9
9
give
instruction
to
a
wise
man
and
he
will
be
yet
wiser
teach
a
just
man
and
he
will
increase
in
learning
9
10
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and
the
knowledge
of
the
holy
is
understanding
9
11
for
by
me
thy
days
shall
be
multiplied
and
the
years
of
thy
life
shall
be
increased
9
12
if
thou
be
wise
thou
shalt
be
wise
for
thyself
but
if
thou
scornest
thou
alone
shalt
bear
it
9
13
a
foolish
woman
is
clamorous
she
is
simple
and
knoweth
nothing
9
14
for
she
sitteth
at
the
door
of
her
house
on
a
seat
in
the
high
places
of
the

the

the

will
not
suffer
the
soul
of
the
righteous
to
famish
but
he
casteth
away
the
substance
of
the
wicked
10

he
becometh
poor
that
dealeth

a
slack

the

10

he
that

blessings

10

the

the

rot
10

the

10

he
that

walketh

the

10
13
in

him
that
is
void

10
14
wise
men
lay
up
knowledge
but
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
near
destruction
10
15
the
rich
man’s
wealth
is
his
strong
city
the
destruction
of
the
poor
is
their
poverty
10
16
the
labour
of
the
righteous
tendeth
to
life
the
fruit
of
the
wicked
to
sin
10
17
he
is
in

that
keepeth

he
that
refuseth
reproof
erreth
10
18
he
that
hideth
hatred
with
lying
lips
and
he
that
uttereth
a

is
a
fool
10
19
in
the
multitude
of
words
there
wanteth
not
sin
but
he
that
refraineth
his
lips
is
wise
10
20
the
tongue
of
the
just
is
as
choice
silver
the
heart
of
the
wicked
is
little
worth
10
21
the

the

of
the
lord
it

and
he
addeth
no
sorrow
with
it
10
23
it
is
as
sport
to
a
fool
to
do
mischief
but
a
man
of
understanding
hath
wisdom
10
24
the
fear
of
the
wicked
it
shall
come
upon
him
but
the
desire
of
the
righteous
shall
be
granted
10
25
as
the
whirlwind
passeth
so
is
the
wicked
no
more
but
the
righteous
is
an
everlasting
foundation
10
26
as
vinegar
to
the
teeth
and
as
smoke
to
the
eyes
so
is
the
sluggard
to
them
that
send
him
10
27
the
fear
of
the
lord
prolongeth
days
but
the
years
of
the
wicked
shall
be
shortened
10
28
the
hope
of
the
righteous
shall
be
gladness
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
shall
perish
10
29
the
way
of
the
lord
is
strength
to
the
upright
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
10
30
the
righteous
shall
never
be
removed
but
the
wicked
shall
not
inhabit
the
earth
10
31
the
mouth
of
the
just
bringeth
forth
wisdom
but
the
froward
tongue
shall
be
cut
out
10
32
the
lips
of
the
righteous
know
what
is
acceptable
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
speaketh
frowardness
11
1
a
false
balance
is
abomination
to
the
lord
but
a
just
weight
is
his
delight
11
2
when
pride
cometh
then
cometh
shame
but
with
the
lowly
is
wisdom
11
3
the
integrity
of
the
upright
shall
guide
them
but
the
perverseness
of
transgressors
shall
destroy
them
11
4
riches
profit
not
in
the
day
of
wrath
but
righteousness
delivereth
from
death
11
5
the
righteousness
of
the
perfect
shall
direct
his
way
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
by
his
own
wickedness
11
6
the
righteousness
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them
but
transgressors
shall
be
taken
in
their
own
naughtiness
11
7
when
a
wicked
man
dieth
his
expectation
shall
perish
and
the
hope
of
unjust
men
perisheth
11
8
the
righteous
is
delivered
out
of
trouble
and
the
wicked
cometh
in
his
stead
11
9
an
hypocrite
with
his
mouth
destroyeth
his
neighbour
but
through
knowledge
shall
the
just
be
delivered
11
10
when
it
goeth
well
with
the
righteous
the
city
rejoiceth
and
when
the
wicked
perish
there
is
shouting
11
11
by
the
blessing
of
the
upright
the
city
is
exalted
but
it
is
overthrown
by
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
11
12
he
that
is
void
of
wisdom
despiseth
his
neighbour
but
a
man
of
understanding
holdeth
his
peace
11
13
a
talebearer
revealeth
secrets
but
he
that
is
of
a
faithful
spirit
concealeth
the
matter
11
14
where
no
counsel
is
the
people
fall
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety
11
15
he
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
shall
smart
for
it
and
he
that
hateth
suretiship
is
sure
11
16
a
gracious
woman
retaineth
honour
and
strong
men
retain
riches
11
17
the
merciful
man
doeth
good
to
his
own
soul
but
he
that
is
cruel
troubleth
his
own
flesh
11
18
the
wicked
worketh
a
deceitful
work
but
to
him
that
soweth
righteousness
shall
be
a
sure
reward
11
19
as
righteousness
tendeth
to
life
so
he
that
pursueth
evil
pursueth
it
to
his
own
death
11
20
they
that
are
of
a
froward
heart
are
abomination
to
the
lord
but
such
as
are
upright
in
their
way
are
his
delight
11
21
though
hand
join
in
hand
the
wicked
shall
not
be
unpunished
but
the
seed
of
the
righteous
shall
be
delivered
11
22
as
a
jewel
of
gold
in
a
swine’s
snout
so
is
a
fair
woman
which
is
without
discretion
11
23
the
desire
of
the
righteous
is
only
good
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
is
wrath
11
24
there
is
that
scattereth
and
yet
increaseth
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than
is
meet
but
it
tendeth
to
poverty
11
25
the
liberal
soul
shall
be
made
fat
and
he
that
watereth
shall
be
watered
also
himself
11
26
he
that
withholdeth
corn
the
people
shall
curse
him
but
blessing
shall
be
upon
the
head
of
him
that
selleth
it
11
27
he
that
diligently
seeketh
good
procureth
favour
but
he
that
seeketh
mischief
it
shall
come
unto
him
11
28
he
that
trusteth
in
his
riches
shall
fall
but
the
righteous
shall
flourish
as
a
branch
11
29
he
that
troubleth
his
own
house
shall
inherit
the
wind
and
the
fool
shall
be
servant
to
the
wise
of
heart
11
30
the
fruit
of
the
righteous
is
a
tree
of
life
and
he
that
winneth
souls
is
wise
11
31
behold
the
righteous
shall
be
recompensed
in
the
earth
much
more
the
wicked
and
the
sinner
12
1
whoso
loveth
instruction
loveth
knowledge
but
he
that
hateth
reproof
is
brutish
12
2
a
good
man
obtaineth
favour
of
the
lord
but
a
man
of
wicked
devices
will
he
condemn
12
3
a
man
shall
not
be
established
by
wickedness
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
shall
not
be
moved
12
4
a
virtuous
woman
is
a
crown
to
her
husband
but
she
that
maketh
ashamed
is
as
rottenness
in
his
bones
12
5
the
thoughts
of
the
righteous
are
right
but
the
counsels
of
the
wicked
are
deceit
12
6
the
words
of
the
wicked
are
to
lie
in
wait
for
blood
but
the
mouth
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them
12
7
the
wicked
are
overthrown
and
are
not
but
the
house
of
the
righteous
shall
stand
12
8
a
man
shall
be
commended
according
to
his
wisdom
but
he
that
is
of
a
perverse
heart
shall
be
despised
12
9
he
that
is
despised
and
hath
a
servant
is
better
than
he
that
honoureth
himself
and
lacketh
bread
12
10
a
righteous
man
regardeth
the
life
of
his
beast
but
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
are
cruel
12
11
he
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
be
satisfied
with
bread
but
he
that
followeth
vain
persons
is
void
of
understanding
12
12
the
wicked
desireth
the
net
of
evil
men
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
yieldeth
fruit
12
13
the
wicked
is
snared
by
the
transgression
of
his
lips
but
the
just
shall
come
out
of
trouble
12
14
a
man
shall
be
satisfied
with
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
and
the
recompence
of
a
man’s
hands
shall
be
rendered
unto
him
12
15
the
way
of
a
fool
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
but
he
that
hearkeneth
unto
counsel
is
wise
12
16
a
fool’s
wrath
is
presently
known
but
a
prudent
man
covereth
shame
12
17
he
that
speaketh
truth
sheweth
forth
righteousness
but
a
false
witness
deceit
12
18
there
is
that
speaketh
like
the
piercings
of
a
sword
but
the
tongue
of
the
wise
is
health
12
19
the
lip
of
truth
shall
be
established
for
ever
but
a
lying
tongue
is
but
for
a
moment
12
20
deceit
is
in
the
heart
of
them
that
imagine
evil
but
to
the
counsellors
of
peace
is
joy
12
21
there
shall
no
evil
happen
to
the
just
but
the
wicked
shall
be
filled
with
mischief
12
22
lying
lips
are
abomination
to
the
lord
but
they
that
deal
truly
are
his
delight
12
23
a
prudent
man
concealeth
knowledge
but
the
heart
of
fools
proclaimeth
foolishness
12
24
the
hand
of
the
diligent
shall
bear
rule
but
the
slothful
shall
be
under
tribute
12
25
heaviness
in
the
heart
of
man
maketh
it
stoop
but
a
good
word
maketh
it
glad
12
26
the
righteous
is
more
excellent
than
his
neighbour
but
the
way
of
the
wicked
seduceth
them
12
27
the
slothful
man
roasteth
not
that
which
he
took
in
hunting
but
the
substance
of
a
diligent
man
is
precious
12
28
in
the
way
of
righteousness
is
life
and
in
the
pathway
thereof
there
is
no
death
13
1
a
wise
son
heareth
his
father’s
instruction
but
a
scorner
heareth
not
rebuke
13
2
a
man
shall
eat
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
but
the
soul
of
the
transgressors
shall
eat
violence
13
3
he
that
keepeth
his
mouth
keepeth
his
life
but
he
that
openeth
wide
his
lips
shall
have
destruction
13
4
the
soul
of
the
sluggard
desireth
and
hath
nothing
but
the
soul
of
the
diligent
shall
be
made
fat
13
5
a
righteous
man
hateth
lying
but
a
wicked
man
is
loathsome
and
cometh
to
shame
13
6
righteousness
keepeth
him
that
is
upright
in
the
way
but
wickedness
overthroweth
the
sinner
13
7
there
is
that
maketh
himself
rich
yet
hath
nothing
there
is
that
maketh
himself
poor
yet
hath
great
riches
13
8
the
ransom
of
a
man’s
life
are
his
riches
but
the
poor
heareth
not
rebuke
13
9
the
light
of
the
righteous
rejoiceth
but
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
13
10
only
by
pride
cometh
contention
but
with
the
well
advised
is
wisdom
13
11
wealth
gotten
by
vanity
shall
be
diminished
but
he
that
gathereth
by
labour
shall
increase
13
12
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
but
when
the
desire
cometh
it
is
a
tree
of
life
13
13
whoso
despiseth
the
word
shall
be
destroyed
but
he
that
feareth
the
commandment
shall
be
rewarded
13
14
the
law
of
the
wise
is
a
fountain
of
life
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death
13
15
good
understanding
giveth
favour
but
the
way
of
transgressors
is
hard
13
16
every
prudent
man
dealeth
with
knowledge
but
a
fool
layeth
open
his
folly
13
17
a
wicked
messenger
falleth
into
mischief
but
a
faithful
ambassador
is
health
13
18
poverty
and
shame
shall
be
to
him
that
refuseth
instruction
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
shall
be
honoured
13
19
the
desire
accomplished
is
sweet
to
the
soul
but
it
is
abomination
to
fools
to
depart
from
evil
13
20
he
that
walketh
with
wise
men
shall
be
wise
but
a
companion
of
fools
shall
be
destroyed
13
21
evil
pursueth
sinners
but
to
the
righteous
good
shall
be
repayed
13
22
a
good
man
leaveth
an
inheritance
to
his
children’s
children
and
the
wealth
of
the
sinner
is
laid
up
for
the
just
13
23
much
food
is
in
the
tillage
of
the
poor
but
there
is
that
is
destroyed
for
want
of
judgment
13
24
he
that
spareth
his
rod
hateth
his
son
but
he
that
loveth
him
chasteneth
him
betimes
13
25
the
righteous
eateth
to
the
satisfying
of
his
soul
but
the
belly
of
the
wicked
shall
want
14
1
every
wise
woman
buildeth
her
house
but
the
foolish
plucketh
it
down
with
her
hands
14
2
he
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness
feareth
the
lord
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
despiseth
him
14
3
in
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
a
rod
of
pride
but
the
lips
of
the
wise
shall
preserve
them
14
4
where
no
oxen
are
the
crib
is
clean
but
much
increase
is
by
the
strength
of
the
ox
14
5
a
faithful
witness
will
not
lie
but
a
false
witness
will
utter
lies
14
6
a
scorner
seeketh
wisdom
and
findeth
it
not
but
knowledge
is
easy
unto
him
that
understandeth
14
7
go
from
the
presence
of
a
foolish
man
when
thou
perceivest
not
in
him
the
lips
of
knowledge
14
8
the
wisdom
of
the
prudent
is
to
understand
his
way
but
the
folly
of
fools
is
deceit
14
9
fools
make
a
mock
at
sin
but
among
the
righteous
there
is
favour
14
10
the
heart
knoweth
his
own
bitterness
and
a
stranger
doth
not
intermeddle
with
his
joy
14
11
the
house
of
the
wicked
shall
be
overthrown
but
the
tabernacle
of
the
upright
shall
flourish
14
12
there
is
a
way
which
seemeth
right
unto
a
man
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death
14
13
even
in
laughter
the
heart
is
sorrowful
and
the
end
of
that
mirth
is
heaviness
14
14
the
backslider
in
heart
shall
be
filled
with
his
own
ways
and
a
good
man
shall
be
satisfied
from
himself
14
15
the
simple
believeth
every
word
but
the
prudent
man
looketh
well
to
his
going
14
16
a
wise
man
feareth
and
departeth
from
evil
but
the
fool
rageth
and
is
confident
14
17
he
that
is
soon
angry
dealeth
foolishly
and
a
man
of
wicked
devices
is
hated
14
18
the
simple
inherit
folly
but
the
prudent
are
crowned
with
knowledge
14
19
the
evil
bow
before
the
good
and
the
wicked
at
the
gates
of
the
righteous
14
20
the
poor
is
hated
even
of
his
own
neighbour
but
the
rich
hath
many
friends
14
21
he
that
despiseth
his
neighbour
sinneth
but
he
that
hath
mercy
on
the
poor
happy
is
he
14
22
do
they
not
err
that
devise
evil
but
mercy
and
truth
shall
be
to
them
that
devise
good
14
23
in
all
labour
there
is
profit
but
the
talk
of
the
lips
tendeth
only
to
penury
14
24
the
crown
of
the
wise
is
their
riches
but
the
foolishness
of
fools
is
folly
14
25
a
true
witness
delivereth
souls
but
a
deceitful
witness
speaketh
lies
14
26
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
strong
confidence
and
his
children
shall
have
a
place
of
refuge
14
27
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
a
fountain
of
life
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death
14
28
in
the
multitude
of
people
is
the
king’s
honour
but
in
the
want
of
people
is
the
destruction
of
the
prince
14
29
he
that
is
slow
to
wrath
is
of
great
understanding
but
he
that
is
hasty
of
spirit
exalteth
folly
14
30
a
sound
heart
is
the
life
of
the
flesh
but
envy
the
rottenness
of
the
bones
14
31
he
that
oppresseth
the
poor
reproacheth
his
maker
but
he
that
honoureth
him
hath
mercy
on
the
poor
14
32
the
wicked
is
driven
away
in
his
wickedness
but
the
righteous
hath
hope
in
his
death
14
33
wisdom
resteth
in
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
but
that
which
is
in
the
midst
of
fools
is
made
known
14
34
righteousness
exalteth
a
nation
but
sin
is
a
reproach
to
any
people
14
35
the
king’s
favour
is
toward
a
wise
servant
but
his
wrath
is
against
him
that
causeth
shame
15
1
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
but
grievous
words
stir
up
anger
15
2
the
tongue
of
the
wise
useth
knowledge
aright
but
the
mouth
of
fools
poureth
out
foolishness
15
3
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
in
every
place
beholding
the
evil
and
the
good
15
4
a
wholesome
tongue
is
a
tree
of
life
but
perverseness
therein
is
a
breach
in
the
spirit
15
5
a
fool
despiseth
his
father’s
instruction
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
is
prudent
15
6
in
the
house
of
the
righteous
is
much
treasure
but
in
the
revenues
of
the
wicked
is
trouble
15
7
the
lips
of
the
wise
disperse
knowledge
but
the
heart
of
the
foolish
doeth
not
so
15
8
the
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
but
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
his
delight
15
9
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
but
he
loveth
him
that
followeth
after
righteousness
15
10
correction
is
grievous
unto
him
that
forsaketh
the
way
and
he
that
hateth
reproof
shall
die
15
11
hell
and
destruction
are
before
the
lord
how
much
more
then
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
15
12
a
scorner
loveth
not
one
that
reproveth
him
neither
will
he
go
unto
the
wise
15
13
a
merry
heart
maketh
a
cheerful
countenance
but
by
sorrow
of
the
heart
the
spirit
is
broken
15
14
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
seeketh
knowledge
but
the
mouth
of
fools
feedeth
on
foolishness
15
15
all
the
days
of
the
afflicted
are
evil
but
he
that
is
of
a
merry
heart
hath
a
continual
feast
15
16
better
is
little
with
the
fear
of
the
lord
than
great
treasure
and
trouble
therewith
15
17
better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
15
18
a
wrathful
man
stirreth
up
strife
but
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
appeaseth
strife
15
19
the
way
of
the
slothful
man
is
as
an
hedge
of
thorns
but
the
way
of
the
righteous
is
made
plain
15
20
a
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
father
but
a
foolish
man
despiseth
his
mother
15
21
folly
is
joy
to
him
that
is
destitute
of
wisdom
but
a
man
of
understanding
walketh
uprightly
15
22
without
counsel
purposes
are
disappointed
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
they
are
established
15
23
a
man
hath
joy
by
the
answer
of
his
mouth
and
a
word
spoken
in
due
season
how
good
is
it
15
24
the
way
of
life
is
above
to
the
wise
that
he
may
depart
from
hell
beneath
15
25
the
lord
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
proud
but
he
will
establish
the
border
of
the
widow
15
26
the
thoughts
of
the
wicked
are
an
abomination
to
the
lord
but
the
words
of
the
pure
are
pleasant
words
15
27
he
that
is
greedy
of
gain
troubleth
his
own
house
but
he
that
hateth
gifts
shall
live
15
28
the
heart
of
the
righteous
studieth
to
answer
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
poureth
out
evil
things
15
29
the
lord
is
far
from
the
wicked
but
he
heareth
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
15
30
the
light
of
the
eyes
rejoiceth
the
heart
and
a
good
report
maketh
the
bones
fat
15
31
the
ear
that
heareth
the
reproof
of
life
abideth
among
the
wise
15
32
he
that
refuseth
instruction
despiseth
his
own
soul
but
he
that
heareth
reproof
getteth
understanding
15
33
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
instruction
of
wisdom
and
before
honour
is
humility
16
1
the
preparations
of
the
heart
in
man
and
the
answer
of
the
tongue
is
from
the
lord
16
2
all
the
ways
of
a
man
are
clean
in
his
own
eyes
but
the
lord
weigheth
the
spirits
16
3
commit
thy
works
unto
the
lord
and
thy
thoughts
shall
be
established
16
4
the
lord
hath
made
all
things
for
himself
yea
even
the
wicked
for
the
day
of
evil
16
5
every
one
that
is
proud
in
heart
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
though
hand
join
in
hand
he
shall
not
be
unpunished
16
6
by
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is
purged
and
by
the
fear
of
the
lord
men
depart
from
evil
16
7
when
a
man’s
ways
please
the
lord
he
maketh
even
his
enemies
to
be
at
peace
with
him
16
8
better
is
a
little
with
righteousness
than
great
revenues
without
right
16
9
a
man’s
heart
deviseth
his
way
but
the
lord
directeth
his
steps
16
10
a
divine
sentence
is
in
the
lips
of
the
king
his
mouth
transgresseth
not
in
judgment
16
11
a
just
weight
and
balance
are
the
lord’s
all
the
weights
of
the
bag
are
his
work
16
12
it
is
an
abomination
to
kings
to
commit
wickedness
for
the
throne
is
established
by
righteousness
16
13
righteous
lips
are
the
delight
of
kings
and
they
love
him
that
speaketh
right
16
14
the
wrath
of
a
king
is
as
messengers
of
death
but
a
wise
man
will
pacify
it
16
15
in
the
light
of
the
king’s
countenance
is
life
and
his
favour
is
as
a
cloud
of
the
latter
rain
16
16
how
much
better
is
it
to
get
wisdom
than
gold
and
to
get
understanding
rather
to
be
chosen
than
silver
16
17
the
highway
of
the
upright
is
to
depart
from
evil
he
that
keepeth
his
way
preserveth
his
soul
16
18
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
an
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
16
19
better
it
is
to
be
of
an
humble
spirit
with
the
lowly
than
to
divide
the
spoil
with
the
proud
16
20
he
that
handleth
a
matter
wisely
shall
find
good
and
whoso
trusteth
in
the
lord
happy
is
he
16
21
the
wise
in
heart
shall
be
called
prudent
and
the
sweetness
of
the
lips
increaseth
learning
16
22
understanding
is
a
wellspring
of
life
unto
him
that
hath
it
but
the
instruction
of
fools
is
folly
16
23
the
heart
of
the
wise
teacheth
his
mouth
and
addeth
learning
to
his
lips
16
24
pleasant
words
are
as
an
honeycomb
sweet
to
the
soul
and
health
to
the
bones
16
25
there
is
a
way
that
seemeth
right
unto
a
man
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death
16
26
he
that
laboureth
laboureth
for
himself
for
his
mouth
craveth
it
of
him
16
27
an
ungodly
man
diggeth
up
evil
and
in
his
lips
there
is
as
a
burning
fire
16
28
a
froward
man
soweth
strife
and
a
whisperer
separateth
chief
friends
16
29
a
violent
man
enticeth
his
neighbour
and
leadeth
him
into
the
way
that
is
not
good
16
30
he
shutteth
his
eyes
to
devise
froward
things
moving
his
lips
he
bringeth
evil
to
pass
16
31
the
hoary
head
is
a
crown
of
glory
if
it
be
found
in
the
way
of
righteousness
16
32
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
the
mighty
and
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
16
33
the
lot
is
cast
into
the
lap
but
the
whole
disposing
thereof
is
of
the
lord
17
1
better
is
a
dry
morsel
and
quietness
therewith
than
an
house
full
of
sacrifices
with
strife
17
2
a
wise
servant
shall
have
rule
over
a
son
that
causeth
shame
and
shall
have
part
of
the
inheritance
among
the
brethren
17
3
the
fining
pot
is
for
silver
and
the
furnace
for
gold
but
the
lord
trieth
the
hearts
17
4
a
wicked
doer
giveth
heed
to
false
lips
and
a
liar
giveth
ear
to
a
naughty
tongue
17
5
whoso
mocketh
the
poor
reproacheth
his
maker
and
he
that
is
glad
at
calamities
shall
not
be
unpunished
17
6
children’s
children
are
the
crown
of
old
men
and
the
glory
of
children
are
their
fathers
17
7
excellent
speech
becometh
not
a
fool
much
less
do
lying
lips
a
prince
17
8
a
gift
is
as
a
precious
stone
in
the
eyes
of
him
that
hath
it
whithersoever
it
turneth
it
prospereth
17
9
he
that
covereth
a
transgression
seeketh
love
but
he
that
repeateth
a
matter
separateth
very
friends
17
10
a
reproof
entereth
more
into
a
wise
man
than
an
hundred
stripes
into
a
fool
17
11
an
evil
man
seeketh
only
rebellion
therefore
a
cruel
messenger
shall
be
sent
against
him
17
12
let
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
meet
a
man
rather
than
a
fool
in
his
folly
17
13
whoso
rewardeth
evil
for
good
evil
shall
not
depart
from
his
house
17
14
the
beginning
of
strife
is
as
when
one
letteth
out
water
therefore
leave
off
contention
before
it
be
meddled
with
17
15
he
that
justifieth
the
wicked
and
he
that
condemneth
the
just
even
they
both
are
abomination
to
the
lord
17
16
wherefore
is
there
a
price
in
the
hand
of
a
fool
to
get
wisdom
seeing
he
hath
no
heart
to
it
17
17
a
friend
loveth
at
all
times
and
a
brother
is
born
for
adversity
17
18
a
man
void
of
understanding
striketh
hands
and
becometh
surety
in
the
presence
of
his
friend
17
19
he
loveth
transgression
that
loveth
strife
and
he
that
exalteth
his
gate
seeketh
destruction
17
20
he
that
hath
a
froward
heart
findeth
no
good
and
he
that
hath
a
perverse
tongue
falleth
into
mischief
17
21
he
that
begetteth
a
fool
doeth
it
to
his
sorrow
and
the
father
of
a
fool
hath
no
joy
17
22
a
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
but
a
broken
spirit
drieth
the
bones
17
23
a
wicked
man
taketh
a
gift
out
of
the
bosom
to
pervert
the
ways
of
judgment
17
24
wisdom
is
before
him
that
hath
understanding
but
the
eyes
of
a
fool
are
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
17
25
a
foolish
son
is
a
grief
to
his
father
and
bitterness
to
her
that
bare
him
17
26
also
to
punish
the
just
is
not
good
nor
to
strike
princes
for
equity
17
27
he
that
hath
knowledge
spareth
his
words
and
a
man
of
understanding
is
of
an
excellent
spirit
17
28
even
a
fool
when
he
holdeth
his
peace
is
counted
wise
and
he
that
shutteth
his
lips
is
esteemed
a
man
of
understanding
18
1
through
desire
a
man
having
separated
himself
seeketh
and
intermeddleth
with
all
wisdom
18
2
a
fool
hath
no
delight
in
understanding
but
that
his
heart
may
discover
itself
18
3
when
the
wicked
cometh
then
cometh
also
contempt
and
with
ignominy
reproach
18
4
the
words
of
a
man’s
mouth
are
as
deep
waters
and
the
wellspring
of
wisdom
as
a
flowing
brook
18
5
it
is
not
good
to
accept
the
person
of
the
wicked
to
overthrow
the
righteous
in
judgment
18
6
a
fool’s
lips
enter
into
contention
and
his
mouth
calleth
for
strokes
18
7
a
fool’s
mouth
is
his
destruction
and
his
lips
are
the
snare
of
his
soul
18
8
the
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly
18
9
he
also
that
is
slothful
in
his
work
is
brother
to
him
that
is
a
great
waster
18
10
the
name
of
the
lord
is
a
strong
tower
the
righteous
runneth
into
it
and
is
safe
18
11
the
rich
man’s
wealth
is
his
strong
city
and
as
an
high
wall
in
his
own
conceit
18
12
before
destruction
the
heart
of
man
is
haughty
and
before
honour
is
humility
18
13
he
that
answereth
a
matter
before
he
heareth
it
it
is
folly
and
shame
unto
him
18
14
the
spirit
of
a
man
will
sustain
his
infirmity
but
a
wounded
spirit
who
can
bear
18
15
the
heart
of
the
prudent
getteth
knowledge
and
the
ear
of
the
wise
seeketh
knowledge
18
16
a
man’s
gift
maketh
room
for
him
and
bringeth
him
before
great
men
18
17
he
that
is
first
in
his
own
cause
seemeth
just
but
his
neighbour
cometh
and
searcheth
him
18
18
the
lot
causeth
contentions
to
cease
and
parteth
between
the
mighty
18
19
a
brother
offended
is
harder
to
be
won
than
a
strong
city
and
their
contentions
are
like
the
bars
of
a
castle
18
20
a
man’s
belly
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
and
with
the

18
21
death
and
life
are
in
the
power
of
the
tongue
and
they
that
love
it
shall
eat
the
fruit
thereof
18
22
whoso
findeth
a
wife
findeth
a
good
thing
and
obtaineth
favour
of
the
lord
18
23
the
poor
useth
intreaties
but
the
rich
answereth
roughly
18
24
a
man
that
hath
friends
must
shew
himself
friendly
and
there
is
a
friend
that
sticketh
closer
than
a
brother
19
1
better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
integrity
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
lips
and
is
a
fool
19
2
also
that
the
soul
be
without
knowledge
it
is
not
good
and
he
that
hasteth
with
his
feet
sinneth
19
3
the
foolishness
of
man
perverteth
his
way
and
his
heart
fretteth
against
the
lord
19
4
wealth
maketh
many
friends
but
the
poor
is
separated
from
his
neighbour
19
5
a
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
not
escape
19
6
many
will
intreat
the
favour
of
the
prince
and
every
man
is
a
friend
to
him
that
giveth
gifts
19
7
all
the
brethren
of
the
poor
do
hate
him
how
much
more
do
his
friends
go
far
from
him
he
pursueth
them
with
words
yet
they
are
wanting
to
him
19
8
he
that
getteth
wisdom
loveth
his
own
soul
he
that
keepeth
understanding
shall
find
good
19
9
a
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
perish
19
10
delight
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool
much
less
for
a
servant
to
have
rule
over
princes
19
11
the
discretion
of
a
man
deferreth
his
anger
and
it
is
his
glory
to
pass
over
a
transgression
19
12
the
king’s
wrath
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion
but
his
favour
is
as
dew
upon
the
grass
19
13
a
foolish
son
is
the
calamity
of
his
father
and
the
contentions
of
a
wife
are
a
continual
dropping
19
14
house
and
riches
are
the
inheritance
of
fathers
and
a
prudent
wife
is
from
the
lord
19
15
slothfulness
casteth
into
a
deep
sleep
and
an
idle
soul
shall
suffer
hunger
19
16
he
that
keepeth
the
commandment
keepeth
his
own
soul
but
he
that
despiseth
his
ways
shall
die
19
17
he
that
hath
pity
upon
the
poor
lendeth
unto
the
lord
and
that
which
he
hath
given
will
he
pay
him
again
19
18
chasten
thy
son
while
there
is
hope
and
let
not
thy
soul
spare
for
his
crying
19
19
a
man
of
great
wrath
shall
suffer
punishment
for
if
thou
deliver
him
yet
thou
must
do
it
again
19
20
hear
counsel
and
receive
instruction
that
thou
mayest
be
wise
in
thy
latter
end
19
21
there
are
many
devices
in
a
man’s
heart
nevertheless
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
shall
stand
19
22
the
desire
of
a
man
is
his
kindness
and
a
poor
man
is
better
than
a
liar
19
23
the
fear
of
the
lord
tendeth
to
life
and
he
that
hath
it
shall
abide
satisfied
he
shall
not
be
visited
with
evil
19
24
a
slothful
man
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
will
not
so
much
as
bring
it
to
his
mouth
again
19
25
smite
a
scorner
and
the
simple
will
beware
and
reprove
one
that
hath
understanding
and
he
will
understand
knowledge
19
26
he
that
wasteth
his
father
and
chaseth
away
his
mother
is
a
son
that
causeth
shame
and
bringeth
reproach
19
27
cease
my
son
to
hear
the
instruction
that
causeth
to
err
from
the
words
of
knowledge
19
28
an
ungodly
witness
scorneth
judgment
and
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
devoureth
iniquity
19
29
judgments
are
prepared
for
scorners
and
stripes
for
the
back
of
fools
20
1
wine
is
a
mocker
strong
drink
is
raging
and
whosoever
is
deceived
thereby
is
not
wise
20
2
the
fear
of
a
king
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion
whoso
provoketh
him
to
anger
sinneth
against
his
own
soul
20
3
it
is
an
honour
for
a
man
to
cease
from
strife
but
every
fool
will
be
meddling
20
4
the
sluggard
will
not
plow
by
reason
of
the
cold
therefore
shall
he
beg
in
harvest
and
have
nothing
20
5
counsel
in
the
heart
of
man
is
like
deep
water
but
a
man
of
understanding
will
draw
it
out
20
6
most
men
will
proclaim
every
one
his
own
goodness
but
a
faithful
man
who
can
find
20
7
the
just
man
walketh
in
his
integrity
his
children
are
blessed
after
him
20
8
a
king
that
sitteth
in
the
throne
of
judgment
scattereth
away
all
evil
with
his
eyes
20
9
who
can
say
i
have
made
my
heart
clean
i
am
pure
from
my
sin
20
10
divers
weights
and
divers
measures
both
of
them
are
alike
abomination
to
the
lord
20
11
even
a
child
is
known
by
his
doings
whether
his
work
be
pure
and
whether
it
be
right
20
12
the
hearing
ear
and
the
seeing
eye
the
lord
hath
made
even
both
of
them
20
13
love
not
sleep
lest
thou
come
to
poverty
open
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
be
satisfied
with
bread
20
14
it
is
naught
it
is
naught
saith
the
buyer
but
when
he
is
gone
his
way
then
he
boasteth
20
15
there
is
gold
and
a
multitude
of
rubies
but
the
lips
of
knowledge
are
a
precious
jewel
20
16
take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman
20
17
bread
of
deceit
is
sweet
to
a
man
but
afterwards
his
mouth
shall
be
filled
with
gravel
20
18
every
purpose
is
established
by
counsel
and
with
good
advice
make
war
20
19
he
that
goeth
about
as
a
talebearer
revealeth
secrets
therefore
meddle
not
with
him
that
flattereth
with
his
lips
20
20
whoso
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
his
lamp
shall
be
put
out
in
obscure
darkness
20
21
an
inheritance
may
be
gotten
hastily
at
the
beginning
but
the
end
thereof
shall
not
be
blessed
20
22
say
not
thou
i
will
recompense
evil
but
wait
on
the
lord
and
he
shall
save
thee
20
23
divers
weights
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
a
false
balance
is
not
good
20
24
man’s
goings
are
of
the
lord
how
can
a
man
then
understand
his
own
way
20
25
it
is
a
snare
to
the
man
who
devoureth
that
which
is
holy
and
after
vows
to
make
enquiry
20
26
a
wise
king
scattereth
the
wicked
and
bringeth
the
wheel
over
them
20
27
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
candle
of
the
lord
searching
all
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly
20
28
mercy
and
truth
preserve
the
king
and
his
throne
is
upholden
by
mercy
20
29
the
glory
of
young
men
is
their
strength
and
the
beauty
of
old
men
is
the
grey
head
20
30
the
blueness
of
a
wound
cleanseth
away
evil
so
do
stripes
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly
21
1
the
king’s
heart
is
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
as
the
rivers
of
water
he
turneth
it
whithersoever
he
will
21
2
every
way
of
a
man
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
but
the
lord
pondereth
the
hearts
21
3
to
do
justice
and
judgment
is
more
acceptable
to
the
lord
than
sacrifice
21
4
an
high
look
and
a
proud
heart
and
the
plowing
of
the
wicked
is
sin
21
5
the
thoughts
of
the
diligent
tend
only
to
plenteousness
but
of
every
one
that
is
hasty
only
to
want
21
6
the
getting
of
treasures
by
a
lying
tongue
is
a
vanity
tossed
to
and
fro
of
them
that
seek
death
21
7
the
robbery
of
the
wicked
shall
destroy
them
because
they
refuse
to
do
judgment
21
8
the
way
of
man
is
froward
and
strange
but
as
for
the
pure
his
work
is
right
21
9
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
a
corner
of
the
housetop
than
with
a
brawling
woman
in
a
wide
house
21
10
the
soul
of
the
wicked
desireth
evil
his
neighbour
findeth
no
favour
in
his
eyes
21
11
when
the
scorner
is
punished
the
simple
is
made
wise
and
when
the
wise
is
instructed
he
receiveth
knowledge
21
12
the
righteous
man
wisely
considereth
the
house
of
the
wicked
but
god
overthroweth
the
wicked
for
their
wickedness
21
13
whoso
stoppeth
his
ears
at
the
cry
of
the
poor
he
also
shall
cry
himself
but
shall
not
be
heard
21
14
a
gift
in
secret
pacifieth
anger
and
a
reward
in
the
bosom
strong
wrath
21
15
it
is
joy
to
the
just
to
do
judgment
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
21
16
the
man
that
wandereth
out
of
the
way
of
understanding
shall
remain
in
the
congregation
of
the
dead
21
17
he
that
loveth
pleasure
shall
be
a
poor
man
he
that
loveth
wine
and
oil
shall
not
be
rich
21
18
the
wicked
shall
be
a
ransom
for
the
righteous
and
the
transgressor
for
the
upright
21
19
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
wilderness
than
with
a
contentious
and
an
angry
woman
21
20
there
is
treasure
to
be
desired
and
oil
in
the
dwelling
of
the
wise
but
a
foolish
man
spendeth
it
up
21
21
he
that
followeth
after
righteousness
and
mercy
findeth
life
righteousness
and
honour
21
22
a
wise
man
scaleth
the
city
of
the
mighty
and
casteth
down
the
strength
of
the
confidence
thereof
21
23
whoso
keepeth
his
mouth
and
his
tongue
keepeth
his
soul
from
troubles
21
24
proud
and
haughty
scorner
is
his
name
who
dealeth
in
proud
wrath
21
25
the
desire
of
the
slothful
killeth
him
for
his
hands
refuse
to
labour
21
26
he
coveteth
greedily
all
the
day
long
but
the
righteous
giveth
and
spareth
not
21
27
the
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
abomination
how
much
more
when
he
bringeth
it
with
a
wicked
mind
21
28
a
false
witness
shall
perish
but
the
man
that
heareth
speaketh
constantly
21
29
a
wicked
man
hardeneth
his
face
but
as
for
the
upright
he
directeth
his
way
21
30
there
is
no
wisdom
nor
understanding
nor
counsel
against
the
lord
21
31
the
horse
is
prepared
against
the
day
of
battle
but
safety
is
of
the
lord
22
1
a
good
name
is
rather
to
be
chosen
than
great
riches
and
loving
favour
rather
than
silver
and
gold
22
2
the
rich
and
poor
meet
together
the
lord
is
the
maker
of
them
all
22
3
a
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil
and
hideth
himself
but
the
simple
pass
on
and
are
punished
22
4
by
humility
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
are
riches
and
honour
and
life
22
5
thorns
and
snares
are
in
the
way
of
the
froward
he
that
doth
keep
his
soul
shall
be
far
from
them
22
6
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
22
7
the
rich
ruleth
over
the
poor
and
the
borrower
is
servant
to
the
lender
22
8
he
that
soweth
iniquity
shall
reap
vanity
and
the
rod
of
his
anger
shall
fail
22
9
he
that
hath
a
bountiful
eye
shall
be
blessed
for
he
giveth
of
his
bread
to
the
poor
22
10
cast
out
the
scorner
and
contention
shall
go
out
yea
strife
and
reproach
shall
cease
22
11
he
that
loveth
pureness
of
heart
for
the
grace
of
his
lips
the
king
shall
be
his
friend
22
12
the
eyes
of
the
lord
preserve
knowledge
and
he
overthroweth
the
words
of
the
transgressor
22
13
the
slothful
man
saith
there
is
a
lion
without
i
shall
be
slain
in
the
streets
22
14
the
mouth
of
strange
women
is
a
deep
pit
he
that
is
abhorred
of
the
lord
shall
fall
therein
22
15
foolishness
is
bound
in
the
heart
of
a
child
but
the
rod
of
correction
shall
drive
it
far
from
him
22
16
he
that
oppresseth
the
poor
to
increase
his
riches
and
he
that
giveth
to
the
rich
shall
surely
come
to
want
22
17
bow
down
thine
ear
and
hear
the
words
of
the
wise
and
apply
thine
heart
unto
my
knowledge
22
18
for
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
if
thou
keep
them
within
thee
they
shall
withal
be
fitted
in
thy
lips
22
19
that
thy
trust
may
be
in
the
lord
i
have
made
known
to
thee
this
day
even
to
thee
22
20
have
not
i
written
to
thee
excellent
things
in
counsels
and
knowledge
22
21
that
i
might
make
thee
know
the
certainty
of
the
words
of
truth
that
thou
mightest
answer
the
words
of
truth
to
them
that
send
unto
thee
22
22
rob
not
the
poor
because
he
is
poor
neither
oppress
the
afflicted
in
the
gate
22
23
for
the
lord
will
plead
their
cause
and
spoil
the
soul
of
those
that
spoiled
them
22
24
make
no
friendship
with
an
angry
man
and
with
a
furious
man
thou
shalt
not
go
22
25
lest
thou
learn
his
ways
and
get
a
snare
to
thy
soul
22
26
be
not
thou
one
of
them
that
strike
hands
or
of
them
that
are
sureties
for
debts
22
27
if
thou
hast
nothing
to
pay
why
should
he
take
away
thy
bed
from
under
thee
22
28
remove
not
the
ancient
landmark
which
thy
fathers
have
set
22
29
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
kings
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
men
23
1
when
thou
sittest
to
eat
with
a
ruler
consider
diligently
what
is
before
thee
23
2
and
put
a
knife
to
thy
throat
if
thou
be
a
man
given
to
appetite
23
3
be
not
desirous
of
his
dainties
for
they
are
deceitful
meat
23
4
labour
not
to
be
rich
cease
from
thine
own
wisdom
23
5
wilt
thou
set
thine
eyes
upon
that
which
is
not
for
riches
certainly
make
themselves
wings
they
fly
away
as
an
eagle
toward
heaven
23
6
eat
thou
not
the
bread
of
him
that
hath
an
evil
eye
neither
desire
thou
his
dainty
meats
23
7
for
as
he
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
eat
and
drink
saith
he
to
thee
but
his
heart
is
not
with
thee
23
8
the
morsel
which
thou
hast
eaten
shalt
thou
vomit
up
and
lose
thy
sweet
words
23
9
speak
not
in
the
ears
of
a
fool
for
he
will
despise
the
wisdom
of
thy
words
23
10
remove
not
the
old
landmark
and
enter
not
into
the
fields
of
the
fatherless
23
11
for
their
redeemer
is
mighty
he
shall
plead
their
cause
with
thee
23
12
apply
thine
heart
unto
instruction
and
thine
ears
to
the
words
of
knowledge
23
13
withhold
not
correction
from
the
child
for
if
thou
beatest
him
with
the
rod
he
shall
not
die
23
14
thou
shalt
beat
him
with
the
rod
and
shalt
deliver
his
soul
from
hell
23
15
my
son
if
thine
heart
be
wise
my
heart
shall
rejoice
even
mine
23
16
yea
my
reins
shall
rejoice
when
thy
lips
speak
right
things
23
17
let
not
thine
heart
envy
sinners
but
be
thou
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
all
the
day
long
23
18
for
surely
there
is
an
end
and
thine
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off
23
19
hear
thou
my
son
and
be
wise
and
guide
thine
heart
in
the
way
23
20
be
not
among
winebibbers
among
riotous
eaters
of
flesh
23
21
for
the
drunkard
and
the
glutton
shall
come
to
poverty
and
drowsiness
shall
clothe
a
man
with
rags
23
22
hearken
unto
thy
father
that
begat
thee
and
despise
not
thy
mother
when
she
is
old
23
23
buy
the
truth
and
sell
it
not
also
wisdom
and
instruction
and
understanding
23
24
the
father
of
the
righteous
shall
greatly
rejoice
and
he
that
begetteth
a
wise
child
shall
have
joy
of
him
23
25
thy
father
and
thy
mother
shall
be
glad
and
she
that
bare
thee
shall
rejoice
23
26
my
son
give
me
thine
heart
and
let
thine
eyes
observe
my
ways
23
27
for
a
whore
is
a
deep
ditch
and
a
strange
woman
is
a
narrow
pit
23
28
she
also
lieth
in
wait
as
for
a
prey
and
increaseth
the
transgressors
among
men
23
29
who
hath
woe
who
hath
sorrow
who
hath
contentions
who
hath
babbling
who
hath
wounds
without
cause
who
hath
redness
of
eyes
23
30
they
that
tarry
long
at
the
wine
they
that
go
to
seek
mixed
wine
23
31
look
not
thou
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
when
it
giveth
his
colour
in
the
cup
when
it
moveth
itself
aright
23
32
at
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
an
adder
23
33
thine
eyes
shall
behold
strange
women
and
thine
heart
shall
utter
perverse
things
23
34
yea
thou
shalt
be
as
he
that
lieth
down
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
or
as
he
that
lieth
upon
the
top
of
a
mast
23
35
they
have
stricken
me
shalt
thou
say
and
i
was
not
sick
they
have
beaten
me
and
i
felt
it
not
when
shall
i
awake
i
will
seek
it
yet
again
24
1
be
not
thou
envious
against
evil
men
neither
desire
to
be
with
them
24
2
for
their
heart
studieth
destruction
and
their
lips
talk
of
mischief
24
3
through
wisdom
is
an
house
builded
and
by
understanding
it
is
established
24
4
and
by
knowledge
shall
the
chambers
be
filled
with
all
precious
and
pleasant
riches
24
5
a
wise
man
is
strong
yea
a
man
of
knowledge
increaseth
strength
24
6
for
by
wise
counsel
thou
shalt
make
thy
war
and
in
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety
24
7
wisdom
is
too
high
for
a
fool
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
in
the
gate
24
8
he
that
deviseth
to
do
evil
shall
be
called
a
mischievous
person
24
9
the
thought
of
foolishness
is
sin
and
the
scorner
is
an
abomination
to
men
24
10
if
thou
faint
in
the
day
of
adversity
thy
strength
is
small
24
11
if
thou
forbear
to
deliver
them
that
are
drawn
unto
death
and
those
that
are
ready
to
be
slain
24
12
if
thou
sayest
behold
we
knew
it
not
doth
not
he
that
pondereth
the
heart
consider
it
and
he
that
keepeth
thy
soul
doth
not
he
know
it
and
shall
not
he
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
works
24
13
my
son
eat
thou
honey
because
it
is
good
and
the
honeycomb
which
is
sweet
to
thy
taste
24
14
so
shall
the
knowledge
of
wisdom
be
unto
thy
soul
when
thou
hast
found
it
then
there
shall
be
a
reward
and
thy
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off
24
15
lay
not
wait
o
wicked
man
against
the
dwelling
of
the
righteous
spoil
not
his
resting
place
24
16
for
a
just
man
falleth
seven
times
and
riseth
up
again
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
into
mischief
24
17
rejoice
not
when
thine
enemy
falleth
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
glad
when
he
stumbleth
24
18
lest
the
lord
see
it
and
it
displease
him
and
he
turn
away
his
wrath
from
him
24
19
fret
not
thyself
because
of
evil
men
neither
be
thou
envious
at
the
wicked
24
20
for
there
shall
be
no
reward
to
the
evil
man
the
candle
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
24
21
my
son
fear
thou
the
lord
and
the
king
and
meddle
not
with
them
that
are
given
to
change
24
22
for
their
calamity
shall
rise
suddenly
and
who
knoweth
the
ruin
of
them
both
24
23
these
things
also
belong
to
the
wise
it
is
not
good
to
have
respect
of
persons
in
judgment
24
24
he
that
saith
unto
the
wicked
thou
are
righteous
him
shall
the
people
curse
nations
shall
abhor
him
24
25
but
to
them
that
rebuke
him
shall
be
delight
and
a
good
blessing
shall
come
upon
them
24
26
every
man
shall
kiss
his
lips
that
giveth
a
right
answer
24
27
prepare
thy
work
without
and
make
it
fit
for
thyself
in
the
field
and
afterwards
build
thine
house
24
28
be
not
a
witness
against
thy
neighbour
without
cause
and
deceive
not
with
thy
lips
24
29
say
not
i
will
do
so
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
me
i
will
render
to
the
man
according
to
his
work
24
30
i
went
by
the
field
of
the
slothful
and
by
the
vineyard
of
the
man
void
of
understanding
24
31
and
lo
it
was
all
grown
over
with
thorns
and
nettles
had
covered
the
face
thereof
and
the
stone
wall
thereof
was
broken
down
24
32
then
i
saw
and
considered
it
well
i
looked
upon
it
and
received
instruction
24
33
yet
a
little
sleep
a
little
slumber
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep
24
34
so
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man
25
1
these
are
also
proverbs
of
solomon
which
the
men
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
copied
out
25
2
it
is
the
glory
of
god
to
conceal
a
thing
but
the
honour
of
kings
is
to
search
out
a
matter
25
3
the
heaven
for
height
and
the
earth
for
depth
and
the
heart
of
kings
is
unsearchable
25
4
take
away
the
dross
from
the
silver
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
vessel
for
the
finer
25
5
take
away
the
wicked
from
before
the
king
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
in
righteousness
25
6
put
not
forth
thyself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
stand
not
in
the
place
of
great
men
25
7
for
better
it
is
that
it
be
said
unto
thee
come
up
hither
than
that
thou
shouldest
be
put
lower
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
whom
thine
eyes
have
seen
25
8
go
not
forth
hastily
to
strive
lest
thou
know
not
what
to
do
in
the
end
thereof
when
thy
neighbour
hath
put
thee
to
shame
25
9
debate
thy
cause
with
thy
neighbour
himself
and
discover
not
a
secret
to
another
25
10
lest
he
that
heareth
it
put
thee
to
shame
and
thine
infamy
turn
not
away
25
11
a
word
fitly
spoken
is
like
apples
of
gold
in
pictures
of
silver
25
12
as
an
earring
of
gold
and
an
ornament
of
fine
gold
so
is
a
wise
reprover
upon
an
obedient
ear
25
13
as
the
cold
of
snow
in
the
time
of
harvest
so
is
a
faithful
messenger
to
them
that
send
him
for
he
refresheth
the
soul
of
his
masters
25
14
whoso
boasteth
himself
of
a
false
gift
is
like
clouds
and
wind
without
rain
25
15
by
long
forbearing
is
a
prince
persuaded
and
a
soft
tongue
breaketh
the
bone
25
16
hast
thou
found
honey
eat
so
much
as
is
sufficient
for
thee
lest
thou
be
filled
therewith
and
vomit
it
25
17
withdraw
thy
foot
from
thy
neighbour’s
house
lest
he
be
weary
of
thee
and
so
hate
thee
25
18
a
man
that
beareth
false
witness
against
his
neighbour
is
a
maul
and
a
sword
and
a
sharp
arrow
25
19
confidence
in
an
unfaithful
man
in
time
of
trouble
is
like
a
broken
tooth
and
a
foot
out
of
joint
25
20
as
he
that
taketh
away
a
garment
in
cold
weather
and
as
vinegar
upon
nitre
so
is
he
that
singeth
songs
to
an
heavy
heart
25
21
if
thine
enemy
be
hungry
give
him
bread
to
eat
and
if
he
be
thirsty
give
him
water
to
drink
25
22
for
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
upon
his
head
and
the
lord
shall
reward
thee
25
23
the
north
wind
driveth
away
rain
so
doth
an
angry
countenance
a
backbiting
tongue
25
24
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
corner
of
the
housetop
than
with
a
brawling
woman
and
in
a
wide
house
25
25
as
cold
waters
to
a
thirsty
soul
so
is
good
news
from
a
far
country
25
26
a
righteous
man
falling
down
before
the
wicked
is
as
a
troubled
fountain
and
a
corrupt
spring
25
27
it
is
not
good
to
eat
much
honey
so
for
men
to
search
their
own
glory
is
not
glory
25
28
he
that
hath
no
rule
over
his
own
spirit
is
like
a
city
that
is
broken
down
and
without
walls
26
1
as
snow
in
summer
and
as
rain
in
harvest
so
honour
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool
26
2
as
the
bird
by
wandering
as
the
swallow
by
flying
so
the
curse
causeless
shall
not
come
26
3
a
whip
for
the
horse
a
bridle
for
the
ass
and
a
rod
for
the
fool’s
back
26
4
answer
not
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
lest
thou
also
be
like
unto
him
26
5
answer
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
lest
he
be
wise
in
his
own
conceit
26
6
he
that
sendeth
a
message
by
the
hand
of
a
fool
cutteth
off
the
feet
and
drinketh
damage
26
7
the
legs
of
the
lame
are
not
equal
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouth
of
fools
26
8
as
he
that
bindeth
a
stone
in
a
sling
so
is
he
that
giveth
honour
to
a
fool
26
9
as
a
thorn
goeth
up
into
the
hand
of
a
drunkard
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouths
of
fools
26
10
the
great
god
that
formed
all
things
both
rewardeth
the
fool
and
rewardeth
transgressors
26
11
as
a
dog
returneth
to
his
vomit
so
a
fool
returneth
to
his
folly
26
12
seest
thou
a
man
wise
in
his
own
conceit
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him
26
13
the
slothful
man
saith
there
is
a
lion
in
the
way
a
lion
is
in
the
streets
26
14
as
the
door
turneth
upon
his
hinges
so
doth
the
slothful
upon
his
bed
26
15
the
slothful
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom
it
grieveth
him
to
bring
it
again
to
his
mouth
26
16
the
sluggard
is
wiser
in
his
own
conceit
than
seven
men
that
can
render
a
reason
26
17
he
that
passeth
by
and
meddleth
with
strife
belonging
not
to
him
is
like
one
that
taketh
a
dog
by
the
ears
26
18
as
a
mad
man
who
casteth
firebrands
arrows
and
death
26
19
so
is
the
man
that
deceiveth
his
neighbour
and
saith
am
not
i
in
sport
26
20
where
no
wood
is
there
the
fire
goeth
out
so
where
there
is
no
talebearer
the
strife
ceaseth
26
21
as
coals
are
to
burning
coals
and
wood
to
fire
so
is
a
contentious
man
to
kindle
strife
26
22
the
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly
26
23
burning
lips
and
a
wicked
heart
are
like
a
potsherd
covered
with
silver
dross
26
24
he
that
hateth
dissembleth
with
his
lips
and
layeth
up
deceit
within
him
26
25
when
he
speaketh
fair
believe
him
not
for
there
are
seven
abominations
in
his
heart
26
26
whose
hatred
is
covered
by
deceit
his
wickedness
shall
be
shewed
before
the
whole
congregation
26
27
whoso
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
therein
and
he
that
rolleth
a
stone
it
will
return
upon
him
26
28
a
lying
tongue
hateth
those
that
are
afflicted
by
it
and
a
flattering
mouth
worketh
ruin
27
1
boast
not
thyself
of
to
morrow
for
thou
knowest
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
27
2
let
another
man
praise
thee
and
not
thine
own
mouth
a
stranger
and
not
thine
own
lips
27
3
a
stone
is
heavy
and
the
sand
weighty
but
a
fool’s
wrath
is
heavier
than
them
both
27
4
wrath
is
cruel
and
anger
is
outrageous
but
who
is
able
to
stand
before
envy
27
5
open
rebuke
is
better
than
secret
love
27
6
faithful
are
the
wounds
of
a
friend
but
the
kisses
of
an
enemy
are
deceitful
27
7
the
full
soul
loatheth
an
honeycomb
but
to
the
hungry
soul
every
bitter
thing
is
sweet
27
8
as
a
bird
that
wandereth
from
her
nest
so
is
a
man
that
wandereth
from
his
place
27
9
ointment
and
perfume
rejoice
the
heart
so
doth
the
sweetness
of
a
man’s
friend
by
hearty
counsel
27
10
thine
own
friend
and
thy
father’s
friend
forsake
not
neither
go
into
thy
brother’s
house
in
the
day
of
thy
calamity
for
better
is
a
neighbour
that
is
near
than
a
brother
far
off
27
11
my
son
be
wise
and
make
my
heart
glad
that
i
may
answer
him
that
reproacheth
me
27
12
a
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil
and
hideth
himself
but
the
simple
pass
on
and
are
punished
27
13
take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman
27
14
he
that
blesseth
his
friend
with
a
loud
voice
rising
early
in
the
morning
it
shall
be
counted
a
curse
to
him
27
15
a
continual
dropping
in
a
very
rainy
day
and
a
contentious
woman
are
alike
27
16
whosoever
hideth
her
hideth
the
wind
and
the
ointment
of
his
right
hand
which
bewrayeth
itself
27
17
iron
sharpeneth
iron
so
a
man
sharpeneth
the
countenance
of
his
friend
27

though

the
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
but
the
righteous
are
bold
as
a
lion
28
2
for
the
transgression
of
a
land
many
are
the
princes
thereof
but
by
a
man
of
understanding
and
knowledge
the
state
thereof
shall
be
prolonged
28
3
a
poor
man
that
oppresseth
the
poor
is
like
a
sweeping
rain
which
leaveth
no
food
28
4
they
that
forsake
the
law
praise
the
wicked
but
such
as
keep
the
law
contend
with
them
28
5
evil
men
understand
not
judgment
but
they
that
seek
the
lord
understand
all
things
28
6
better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
though
he
be
rich
28
7
whoso
keepeth
the
law
is
a
wise
son
but
he
that
is
a
companion
of
riotous
men
shameth
his
father
28
8
he
that
by
usury
and
unjust
gain
increaseth
his
substance
he
shall
gather
it
for
him
that
will
pity
the
poor
28
9
he
that
turneth
away
his
ear
from
hearing
the
law
even
his
prayer
shall
be
abomination
28
10
whoso
causeth
the
righteous
to
go
astray
in
an
evil
way
he
shall
fall
himself
into
his
own
pit
but
the
upright
shall
have
good
things
in
possession
28
11
the
rich
man
is
wise
in
his
own
conceit
but
the
poor
that
hath
understanding
searcheth
him
out
28
12
when
righteous
men
do
rejoice
there
is
great
glory
but
when
the
wicked
rise
a
man
is
hidden
28
13
he
that
covereth
his
sins
shall
not
prosper
but
whoso
confesseth
and
forsaketh
them
shall
have
mercy
28
14
happy
is
the
man
that
feareth
alway
but
he
that
hardeneth
his
heart
shall
fall
into
mischief
28
15
as
a
roaring
lion
and
a
ranging
bear
so
is
a
wicked
ruler
over
the
poor
people
28
16
the
prince
that
wanteth
understanding
is
also
a
great
oppressor
but
he
that
hateth
covetousness
shall
prolong
his
days
28
17
a
man
that
doeth
violence
to
the
blood
of
any
person
shall
flee
to
the
pit
let
no
man
stay
him
28
18
whoso
walketh
uprightly
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
shall
fall
at
once
28
19
he
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
have
plenty
of
bread
but
he
that
followeth
after
vain
persons
shall
have
poverty
enough
28
20
a
faithful
man
shall
abound
with
blessings
but
he
that
maketh
haste
to
be
rich
shall
not
be
innocent
28
21
to
have
respect
of
persons
is
not
good
for
for
a
piece
of
bread
that
man
will
transgress
28
22
he
that
hasteth
to
be
rich
hath
an
evil
eye
and
considereth
not
that
poverty
shall
come
upon
him
28
23
he
that
rebuketh
a
man
afterwards
shall
find
more
favour
than
he
that
flattereth
with
the
tongue
28
24
whoso
robbeth
his
father
or
his
mother
and
saith
it
is
no
transgression
the
same
is
the
companion
of
a
destroyer
28
25
he
that
is
of
a
proud
heart
stirreth
up
strife
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
made
fat
28
26
he
that
trusteth
in
his
own
heart
is
a
fool
but
whoso
walketh
wisely
he
shall
be
delivered
28
27
he
that
giveth
unto
the
poor
shall
not
lack
but
he
that
hideth
his
eyes
shall
have
many
a
curse
28
28
when
the
wicked
rise
men
hide
themselves
but
when
they
perish
the
righteous
increase
29
1
he
that
being
often
reproved
hardeneth
his
neck
shall
suddenly
be
destroyed
and
that
without
remedy
29
2
when
the
righteous
are
in
authority
the
people
rejoice
but
when
the
wicked
beareth
rule
the
people
mourn
29
3
whoso
loveth
wisdom
rejoiceth
his
father
but
he
that
keepeth
company
with
harlots
spendeth
his
substance
29
4
the
king
by
judgment
establisheth
the
land
but
he
that
receiveth
gifts
overthroweth
it
29
5
a
man
that
flattereth
his
neighbour
spreadeth
a
net
for
his
feet
29
6
in
the
transgression
of
an
evil
man
there
is
a
snare
but
the
righteous
doth
sing
and
rejoice
29
7
the
righteous
considereth
the
cause
of
the
poor
but
the
wicked
regardeth
not
to
know
it
29
8
scornful
men
bring
a
city
into
a
snare
but
wise
men
turn
away
wrath
29
9
if
a
wise
man
contendeth
with
a
foolish
man
whether
he
rage
or
laugh
there
is
no
rest
29
10
the
bloodthirsty
hate
the
upright
but
the
just
seek
his
soul
29
11
a
fool
uttereth
all
his
mind
but
a
wise
man
keepeth
it
in
till
afterwards
29
12
if
a
ruler
hearken
to
lies
all
his
servants
are
wicked
29
13
the
poor
and
the
deceitful
man
meet
together
the
lord
lighteneth
both
their
eyes
29
14
the
king
that
faithfully
judgeth
the
poor
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever
29
15
the
rod
and
reproof
give
wisdom
but
a
child
left
to
himself
bringeth
his
mother
to
shame
29
16
when
the
wicked
are
multiplied
transgression
increaseth
but
the
righteous
shall
see
their
fall
29
17
correct
thy
son
and
he
shall
give
thee
rest
yea
he
shall
give
delight
unto
thy
soul
29
18
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
but
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
he
29
19
a
servant
will
not
be
corrected
by
words
for
though
he
understand
he
will
not
answer
29
20
seest
thou
a
man
that
is
hasty
in
his
words
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him
29
21
he
that
delicately
bringeth
up
his
servant
from
a
child
shall
have
him
become
his
son
at

29

an
angry
man
stirreth
up
strife
and
a
furious
man
aboundeth
in
transgression
29
23
a
man’s
pride
shall
bring
him
low
but
honour
shall
uphold
the
humble
in

29
24
whoso
is
partner
with
a
thief
hateth
his
own
soul
he
heareth
cursing
and
bewrayeth
it
not
29
25
the
fear
of
man
bringeth
a
snare
but
whoso
putteth
his
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
safe
29
26
many
seek
the
ruler’s
favour
but
every

from

29
27
an

things

wonderful
for

four
which

the
way
of
an
eagle
in

air
the
way
of
a
serpent
upon

rock
the
way
of

ship
in

of

and
the
way
of

with

eateth

her

i
have

no

things

for
four
which

30
22
for
a

when
he
reigneth
and
a
fool
when
he
is
filled
with
meat
30
23
for
an
odious
woman
when
she
is
married
and
an
handmaid
that
is
heir
to
her
mistress
30

there
be
four
things
which
are
little
upon

earth

they
are
exceeding
wise

vanity
of
vanities
saith
the
preacher
vanity
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
1
3
what
profit
hath
a
man
of
all
his
labour
which
he
taketh
under
the
sun
1
4
one
generation
passeth
away
and
another
generation
cometh
but
the
earth
abideth
for
ever
1
5
the
sun
also
ariseth
and
the
sun
goeth
down
and
hasteth
to
his
place
where
he
arose
1
6
the
wind
goeth
toward
the
south
and
turneth
about
unto
the
north
it
whirleth
about
continually
and
the
wind
returneth
again
according
to
his
circuits
1
7
all
the
rivers
run
into
the
sea
yet
the
sea
is
not
full
unto
the
place
from
whence
the
rivers
come
thither
they
return
again
1
8
all
things
are
full
of
labour
man
cannot
utter
it
the
eye
is
not
satisfied
with
seeing
nor
the
ear
filled
with
hearing
1
9
the
thing
that
hath
been
it
is
that
which
shall
be
and
that
which
is
done
is
that
which
shall
be
done
and
there
is
no
new
thing
under
the
sun
1
10
is
there
any
thing
whereof
it
may
be
said
see
this
is
new
it
hath
been
already
of
old
time
which
was
before
us
1
11
there
is
no
remembrance
of
former
things
neither
shall
there
be
any
remembrance
of
things
that
are
to
come
with
those
that
shall
come
after
1
12
i
the
preacher
was
king
over
israel
in
jerusalem
1
13
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
heaven
this
sore
travail
hath
god
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
therewith
1
14
i
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
1
15
that
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot
be
numbered
1
16
i
communed
with
mine
own
heart
saying
lo
i
am
come
to
great
estate
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
jerusalem
yea
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
1
17
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
know
wisdom
and
to
know
madness
and
folly
i
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
spirit
1
18
for
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
2
1
i
said
in
mine
heart
go
to
now
i
will
prove
thee
with
mirth
therefore
enjoy
pleasure
and
behold
this
also
is
vanity
2
2
i
said
of
laughter
it
is
mad
and
of
mirth
what
doeth
it
2
3
i
sought
in
mine
heart
to
give
myself
unto
wine
yet
acquainting
mine
heart
with
wisdom
and
to
lay
hold
on
folly
till
i
might
see
what
was
that
good
for
the
sons
of
men
which
they
should
do
under
the
heaven
all
the
days
of
their
life
2
4
i
made
me
great
works
i
builded
me
houses
i
planted
me
vineyards
2
5
i
made
me
gardens
and
orchards
and
i
planted
trees
in
them
of
all
kind
of
fruits
2
6
i
made
me
pools
of
water
to
water
therewith
the
wood
that
bringeth
forth
trees
2
7
i
got
me
servants
and
maidens
and
had
servants
born
in
my
house
also
i
had
great
possessions
of
great
and
small
cattle
above
all
that
were
in
jerusalem
before
me
2
8
i
gathered
me
also
silver
and
gold
and
the
peculiar
treasure
of
kings
and
of
the
provinces
i
gat
me
men
singers
and
women
singers
and
the
delights
of
the
sons
of
men
as
musical
instruments
and
that
of
all
sorts
2
9
so
i
was
great
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
jerusalem
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
me
2
10
and
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
i
kept
not
from
them
i
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
joy
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
labour
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
2
11
then
i
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
and
on
the
labour
that
i
had
laboured
to
do
and
behold
all
was
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
sun
2
12
and
i
turned
myself
to
behold
wisdom
and
madness
and
folly
for
what
can
the
man
do
that
cometh
after
the
king
even
that
which
hath
been
already
done
2
13
then
i
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
folly
as
far
as
light
excelleth
darkness
2
14
the
wise
man’s
eyes
are
in
his
head
but
the
fool
walketh
in
darkness
and
i
myself
perceived
also
that
one
event
happeneth
to
them
all
2
15
then
said
i
in
my
heart
as
it
happeneth
to
the
fool
so
it
happeneth
even
to
me
and
why
was
i
then
more
wise
then
i
said
in
my
heart
that
this
also
is
vanity
2
16
for
there
is
no
remembrance
of
the
wise
more
than
of
the
fool
for
ever
seeing
that
which
now
is
in
the
days
to
come
shall
all
be
forgotten
and
how
dieth
the
wise
man
as
the
fool
2
17
therefore
i
hated
life
because
the
work
that
is
wrought
under
the
sun
is
grievous
unto
me
for
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
2
18
yea
i
hated
all
my
labour
which
i
had
taken
under
the
sun
because
i
should
leave
it
unto
the
man
that
shall
be
after
me
2
19
and
who
knoweth
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
man
or
a
fool
yet
shall
he
have
rule
over
all
my
labour
wherein
i
have
laboured
and
wherein
i
have
shewed
myself
wise
under
the
sun
this
is
also
vanity
2
20
therefore
i
went
about
to
cause
my
heart
to
despair
of
all
the
labour
which
i
took
under
the
sun
2
21
for
there
is
a
man
whose
labour
is
in
wisdom
and
in
knowledge
and
in
equity
yet
to
a
man
that
hath
not
laboured
therein
shall
he
leave
it
for
his
portion
this
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
evil
2
22
for
what
hath
man
of
all
his
labour
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
heart
wherein
he
hath
laboured
under
the
sun
2
23
for
all
his
days
are
sorrows
and
his
travail
grief
yea
his
heart
taketh
not
rest
in
the
night
this
is
also
vanity
2
24
there
is
nothing
better
for
a
man
than
that
he
should
eat
and
drink
and
that
he
should
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
in
his
labour
this
also
i
saw
that
it
was
from
the
hand
of
god
2
25
for
who
can
eat
or
who
else
can
hasten
hereunto
more
than
i
2
26
for
god
giveth
to
a
man
that
is
good
in
his
sight
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
joy
but
to
the
sinner
he
giveth
travail
to
gather
and
to
heap
up
that
he
may
give
to
him
that
is
good
before
god
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
3
1
to
every
thing
there
is
a
season
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
3
2
a
time
to
be
born
and
a
time
to
die
a
time
to
plant
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted
3
3
a
time
to
kill
and
a
time
to
heal
a
time
to
break
down
and
a
time
to
build
up
3
4
a
time
to
weep
and
a
time
to
laugh
a
time
to
mourn
and
a
time
to
dance
3
5
a
time
to
cast
away
stones
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
together
a
time
to
embrace
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
embracing
3
6
a
time
to
get
and
a
time
to
lose
a
time
to
keep
and
a
time
to
cast
away
3
7
a
time
to
rend
and
a
time
to
sew
a
time
to
keep
silence
and
a
time
to
speak
3
8
a
time
to
love
and
a
time
to
hate
a
time
of
war
and
a
time
of
peace
3
9
what
profit
hath
he
that
worketh
in
that
wherein
he
laboureth
3
10
i
have
seen
the
travail
which
god
hath
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
be
exercised
in
it
3
11
he
hath
made
every
thing
beautiful
in
his
time
also
he
hath
set
the
world
in
their
heart
so
that
no
man
can
find
out
the
work
that
god
maketh
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
3
12
i
know
that
there
is
no
good
in
them
but
for
a
man
to
rejoice
and
to
do
good
in
his
life
3
13
and
also
that
every
man
should
eat
and
drink
and
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
it
is
the
gift
of
god
3
14
i
know
that
whatsoever
god
doeth
it
shall
be
for
ever
nothing
can
be
put
to
it
nor
any
thing
taken
from
it
and
god
doeth
it
that
men
should
fear
before
him
3
15
that
which
hath
been
is
now
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
and
god
requireth
that
which
is
past
3
16
and
moreover
i
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
of
judgment
that
wickedness
was
there
and
the
place
of
righteousness
that
iniquity
was
there
3
17
i
said
in
mine
heart
god
shall
judge
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
for
there
is
a
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
every
work
3
18
i
said
in
mine
heart
concerning
the
estate
of
the
sons
of
men
that
god
might
manifest
them
and
that
they
might
see
that
they
themselves
are
beasts
3
19
for
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
beasts
even
one
thing
befalleth
them
as
the
one
dieth
so
dieth
the
other
yea
they
have
all
one
breath
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
above
a
beast
for
all
is
vanity
3
20
all
go
unto
one
place
all
are
of
the
dust
and
all
turn
to
dust
again
3
21
who
knoweth
the
spirit
of
man
that
goeth
upward
and
the
spirit
of
the
beast
that
goeth
downward
to
the
earth
3
22
wherefore
i
perceive
that
there
is
nothing
better
than
that
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
works
for
that
is
his
portion
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after
him
4
1
so
i
returned
and
considered
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
the
tears
of
such
as
were
oppressed
and
they
had
no
comforter
and
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
there
was
power
but
they
had
no
comforter
4
2
wherefore
i
praised
the
dead
which
are
already
dead
more
than
the
living
which
are
yet
alive
4
3
yea
better
is
he
than
both
they
which
hath
not
yet
been
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
4
4
again
i
considered
all
travail
and
every
right
work
that
for
this
a
man
is
envied
of
his
neighbour
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
4
5
the
fool
foldeth
his
hands
together
and
eateth
his
own
flesh
4
6
better
is
an
handful
with
quietness
than
both
the
hands
full
with
travail
and
vexation
of
spirit
4
7
then
i
returned
and
i
saw
vanity
under
the
sun
4
8
there
is
one
alone
and
there
is
not
a
second
yea
he
hath
neither
child
nor
brother
yet
is
there
no
end
of
all
his
labour
neither
is
his
eye
satisfied
with
riches
neither
saith
he
for
whom
do
i
labour
and
bereave
my
soul
of
good
this
is
also
vanity
yea
it
is
a
sore
travail
4
9
two
are
better
than
one
because
they
have
a
good
reward
for
their
labour
4
10
for
if
they
fall
the
one
will
lift
up
his
fellow
but
woe
to
him
that
is
alone
when
he
falleth
for
he
hath
not
another
to
help
him
up
4
11
again
if
two
lie
together
then
they
have
heat
but
how
can
one
be
warm
alone
4
12
and
if
one
prevail
against
him
two
shall
withstand
him
and
a
threefold
cord
is
not
quickly
broken
4
13
better
is
a
poor
and
a
wise
child
than
an
old
and
foolish
king
who
will
no
more
be
admonished
4
14
for
out
of
prison
he
cometh
to
reign
whereas
also
he
that
is
born
in
his
kingdom
becometh
poor
4
15
i
considered
all
the
living
which
walk
under
the
sun
with
the
second
child
that
shall
stand
up
in
his
stead
4
16
there
is
no
end
of
all
the
people
even
of
all
that
have
been
before
them
they
also
that
come
after
shall
not
rejoice
in
him
surely
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
5
1
keep
thy
foot
when
thou
goest
to
the
house
of
god
and
be
more
ready
to
hear
than
to
give
the
sacrifice
of
fools
for
they
consider
not
that
they
do
evil
5
2
be
not
rash
with
thy
mouth
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
hasty
to
utter
any
thing
before
god
for
god
is
in
heaven
and
thou
upon
earth
therefore
let
thy
words
be
few
5
3
for
a
dream
cometh
through
the
multitude
of
business
and
a
fool’s
voice
is
known
by
multitude
of
words
5
4
when
thou
vowest
a
vow
unto
god
defer
not
to
pay
it
for
he
hath
no
pleasure
in
fools
pay
that
which
thou
hast
vowed
5
5
better
is
it
that
thou
shouldest
not
vow
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
pay
5
6
suffer
not
thy
mouth
to
cause
thy
flesh
to
sin
neither
say
thou
before
the
angel
that
it
was
an
error
wherefore
should
god
be
angry
at
thy
voice
and
destroy
the
work
of
thine
hands
5
7
for
in
the
multitude
of
dreams
and
many
words
there
are
also
divers
vanities
but
fear
thou
god
5
8
if
thou
seest
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
violent
perverting
of
judgment
and
justice
in
a
province
marvel
not
at
the
matter
for
he
that
is
higher
than
the
highest
regardeth
and
there
be
higher
than
they
5
9
moreover
the
profit
of
the
earth
is
for
all
the
king
himself
is
served
by
the
field
5
10
he
that
loveth
silver
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
silver
nor
he
that
loveth
abundance
with
increase
this
is
also
vanity
5
11
when
goods
increase
they
are
increased
that
eat
them
and
what
good
is
there
to
the
owners
thereof
saving
the
beholding
of
them
with
their
eyes
5
12
the
sleep
of
a
labouring
man
is
sweet
whether
he
eat
little
or
much
but
the
abundance
of
the
rich
will
not
suffer
him
to
sleep
5
13
there
is
a
sore
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
namely
riches
kept
for
the
owners
thereof
to
their
hurt
5
14
but
those
riches
perish
by
evil
travail
and
he
begetteth
a
son
and
there
is
nothing
in
his
hand
5
15
as
he
came
forth
of
his
mother’s
womb
naked
shall
he
return
to
go
as
he
came
and
shall
take
nothing
of
his
labour
which
he
may
carry
away
in
his
hand
5
16
and
this
also
is
a
sore
evil
that
in
all
points
as
he
came
so
shall
he
go
and
what
profit
hath
he
that
hath
laboured
for
the
wind
5
17
all
his
days
also
he
eateth
in
darkness
and
he
hath
much
sorrow
and
wrath
with
his
sickness
5
18
behold
that
which
i
have
seen
it
is
good
and
comely
for
one
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
that
he
taketh
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
his
life
which
god
giveth
him
for
it
is
his
portion
5
19
every
man
also
to
whom
god
hath
given
riches
and
wealth
and
hath
given
him
power
to
eat
thereof
and
to
take
his
portion
and
to
rejoice
in
his
labour
this
is
the
gift
of
god
5
20
for
he
shall
not
much
remember
the
days
of
his
life
because
god
answereth
him
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
6
1
there
is
an
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
and
it
is
common
among
men
6
2
a
man
to
whom
god
hath
given
riches
wealth
and
honour
so
that
he
wanteth
nothing
for
his
soul
of
all
that
he
desireth
yet
god
giveth
him
not
power
to
eat
thereof
but
a
stranger
eateth
it
this
is
vanity
and
it
is
an
evil
disease
6
3
if
a
man
beget
an
hundred
children
and
live
many
years
so
that
the
days
of
his
years
be
many
and
his
soul
be
not
filled
with
good
and
also
that
he
have
no
burial
i
say
that
an
untimely
birth
is
better
than
he
6
4
for
he
cometh
in
with
vanity
and
departeth
in
darkness
and
his
name
shall
be
covered
with
darkness
6
5
moreover
he
hath
not
seen
the
sun
nor
known
any
thing
this
hath
more
rest
than
the
other
6
6
yea
though
he
live
a
thousand
years
twice
told
yet
hath
he
seen
no
good
do
not
all
go
to
one
place
6
7
all
the
labour
of
man
is
for
his
mouth
and
yet
the
appetite
is
not
filled
6
8
for
what
hath
the
wise
more
than
the
fool
what
hath
the
poor
that
knoweth
to
walk
before
the
living
6
9
better
is
the
sight
of
the
eyes
than
the
wandering
of
the
desire
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
6
10
that
which
hath
been
is
named
already
and
it
is
known
that
it
is
man
neither
may
he
contend
with
him
that
is
mightier
than
he
6
11
seeing
there
be
many
things
that
increase
vanity
what
is
man
the
better
6
12
for
who
knoweth
what
is
good
for
man
in
this
life
all
the
days
of
his
vain
life
which
he
spendeth
as
a
shadow
for
who
can
tell
a
man
what
shall
be
after
him
under
the
sun
7
1
a
good
name
is
better
than
precious
ointment
and
the
day
of
death
than
the
day
of
one’s
birth
7
2
it
is
better
to
go
to
the
house
of
mourning
than
to
go
to
the
house
of
feasting
for
that
is
the
end
of
all
men
and
the
living
will
lay
it
to
his
heart
7
3
sorrow
is
better
than
laughter
for
by
the
sadness
of
the
countenance
the
heart
is
made
better
7
4
the
heart
of
the
wise
is
in
the
house
of
mourning
but
the
heart
of
fools
is
in
the
house
of
mirth
7
5
it
is
better
to
hear
the
rebuke
of
the
wise
than
for
a
man
to
hear
the
song
of
fools
7
6
for
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
so
is
the
laughter
of
the
fool
this
also
is
vanity
7
7
surely
oppression
maketh
a
wise
man
mad
and
a
gift
destroyeth
the
heart
7
8
better
is
the
end
of
a
thing
than
the
beginning
thereof
and
the
patient
in
spirit
is
better
than
the
proud
in
spirit
7
9
be
not
hasty
in
thy
spirit
to
be
angry
for
anger
resteth
in
the
bosom
of
fools
7
10
say
not
thou
what
is
the
cause
that
the
former
days
were
better
than
these
for
thou
dost
not
enquire
wisely
concerning
this
7
11
wisdom
is
good
with
an
inheritance
and
by
it
there
is
profit
to
them
that
see
the
sun
7
12
for
wisdom
is
a
defence
and
money
is
a
defence
but
the
excellency
of
knowledge
is
that
wisdom
giveth
life
to
them
that
have
it
7
13
consider
the
work
of
god
for
who
can
make
that
straight
which
he
hath
made
crooked
7
14
in
the
day
of
prosperity
be
joyful
but
in
the
day
of
adversity
consider
god
also
hath
set
the
one
over
against
the
other
to
the
end
that
man
should
find
nothing
after
him
7
15
all
things
have
i
seen
in
the
days
of
my
vanity
there
is
a
just
man
that
perisheth
in
his
righteousness
and
there
is
a
wicked
man
that
prolongeth
his
life
in
his
wickedness
7
16
be
not
righteous
over
much
neither
make
thyself
over
wise
why
shouldest
thou
destroy
thyself
7
17
be
not
over
much
wicked
neither
be
thou
foolish
why
shouldest
thou
die
before
thy
time
7
18
it
is
good
that
thou
shouldest
take
hold
of
this
yea
also
from
this
withdraw
not
thine
hand
for
he
that
feareth
god
shall
come
forth
of
them
all
7
19
wisdom
strengtheneth
the
wise
more
than
ten
mighty
men
which
are
in
the
city
7
20
for
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
earth
that
doeth
good
and
sinneth
not
7
21
also
take
no
heed
unto
all
words
that
are
spoken
lest
thou
hear
thy
servant
curse
thee
7
22
for
oftentimes
also
thine
own
heart
knoweth
that
thou
thyself
likewise
hast
cursed
others
7
23
all
this
have
i
proved
by
wisdom
i
said
i
will
be
wise
but
it
was
far
from
me
7
24
that
which
is
far
off
and
exceeding
deep
who
can
find
it
out
7
25
i
applied
mine
heart
to
know
and
to
search
and
to
seek
out
wisdom
and
the
reason
of
things
and
to
know
the
wickedness
of
folly
even
of
foolishness
and
madness
7
26
and
i
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
woman
whose
heart
is
snares
and
nets
and
her
hands
as
bands
whoso
pleaseth
god
shall
escape
from
her
but
the
sinner
shall
be
taken
by
her
7
27
behold
this
have
i
found
saith
the
preacher
counting
one
by
one
to
find
out
the
account
7
28
which
yet
my
soul
seeketh
but
i
find
not
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
i
found
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
i
not
found
7
29
lo
this
only
have
i
found
that
god
hath
made
man
upright
but
they
have
sought
out
many
inventions
8
1
who
is
as
the
wise
man
and
who
knoweth
the
interpretation
of
a
thing
a
man’s
wisdom
maketh
his
face
to
shine
and
the
boldness
of
his
face
shall
be
changed
8
2
i
counsel
thee
to
keep
the
king’s
commandment
and
that
in
regard
of
the
oath
of
god
8
3
be
not
hasty
to
go
out
of
his
sight
stand
not
in
an
evil
thing
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
pleaseth
him
8
4
where
the
word
of
a
king
is
there
is
power
and
who
may
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
8
5
whoso
keepeth
the
commandment
shall
feel
no
evil
thing
and
a
wise
man’s
heart
discerneth
both
time
and
judgment
8
6
because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
judgment
therefore
the
misery
of
man
is
great
upon
him
8
7
for
he
knoweth
not
that
which
shall
be
for
who
can
tell
him
when
it
shall
be
8
8
there
is
no
man
that
hath
power
over
the
spirit
to
retain
the
spirit
neither
hath
he
power
in
the
day
of
death
and
there
is
no
discharge
in
that
war
neither
shall
wickedness
deliver
those
that
are
given
to
it
8
9
all
this
have
i
seen
and
applied
my
heart
unto
every
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
there
is
a
time
wherein
one
man
ruleth
over
another
to
his
own
hurt
8
10
and
so
i
saw
the
wicked
buried
who
had
come
and
gone
from
the
place
of
the
holy
and
they
were
forgotten
in
the
city
where
they
had
so
done
this
is
also
vanity
8
11
because
sentence
against
an
evil
work
is
not
executed
speedily
therefore
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
fully
set
in
them
to
do
evil
8
12
though
a
sinner
do
evil
an
hundred
times
and
his
days
be
prolonged
yet
surely
i
know
that
it
shall
be
well
with
them
that
fear
god
which
fear
before
him
8
13
but
it
shall
not
be
well
with
the
wicked
neither
shall
he
prolong
his
days
which
are
as
a
shadow
because
he
feareth
not
before
god
8
14
there
is
a
vanity
which
is
done
upon
the
earth
that
there
be
just
men
unto
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
wicked
again
there
be
wicked
men
to
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
righteous
i
said
that
this
also
is
vanity
8
15
then
i
commended
mirth
because
a
man
hath
no
better
thing
under
the
sun
than
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
be
merry
for
that
shall
abide
with
him
of
his
labour
the
days
of
his
life
which
god
giveth
him
under
the
sun
8
16
when
i
applied
mine
heart
to
know
wisdom
and
to
see
the
business
that
is
done
upon
the
earth
(for
also
there
is
that
neither
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
eyes
)
8
17
then
i
beheld
all
the
work
of
god
that
a
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
because
though
a
man
labour
to
seek
it
out
yet
he
shall
not
find
it
yea
farther
though
a
wise
man
think
to
know
it
yet
shall
he
not
be
able
to
find
it
9
1
for
all
this
i
considered
in
my
heart
even
to
declare
all
this
that
the
righteous
and
the
wise
and
their
works
are
in
the
hand
of
god
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
by
all
that
is
before
them
9
2
all
things
come
alike
to
all
there
is
one
event
to
the
righteous
and
to
the
wicked
to
the
good
and
to
the
clean
and
to
the
unclean
to
him
that
sacrificeth
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
not
as
is
the
good
so
is
the
sinner
and
he
that
sweareth
as
he
that
feareth
an
oath
9
3
this
is
an
evil
among
all
things
that
are
done
under
the
sun
that
there
is
one
event
unto
all
yea
also
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
evil
and
madness
is
in
their
heart
while
they
live
and
after
that
they
go
to
the
dead
9
4
for
to
him
that
is
joined
to
all
the
living
there
is
hope
for
a
living
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
lion
9
5
for
the
living
know
that
they
shall
die
but
the
dead
know
not
any
thing
neither
have
they
any
more
a
reward
for
the
memory
of
them
is
forgotten
9
6
also
their
love
and
their
hatred
and
their
envy
is
now
perished
neither
have
they
any
more
a
portion
for
ever
in
any
thing
that
is
done
under
the
sun
9
7
go
thy
way
eat
thy
bread
with
joy
and
drink
thy
wine
with
a
merry
heart
for
god
now
accepteth
thy
works
9
8
let
thy
garments
be
always
white
and
let
thy
head
lack
no
ointment
9
9
live
joyfully
with
the
wife
whom
thou
lovest
all
the
days
of
the
life
of
thy
vanity
which
he
hath
given
thee
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
thy
vanity
for
that
is
thy
portion
in
this
life
and
in
thy
labour
which
thou
takest
under
the
sun
9
10
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
for
there
is
no
work
nor
device
nor
knowledge
nor
wisdom
in
the
grave
whither
thou
goest
9
11
i
returned
and
saw
under
the
sun
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong
neither
yet
bread
to
the
wise
nor
yet
riches
to
men
of
understanding
nor
yet
favour
to
men
of
skill
but
time
and
chance
happeneth
to
them
all
9
12
for
man
also
knoweth
not
his
time
as
the
fishes
that
are
taken
in
an
evil
net
and
as
the
birds
that
are
caught
in
the
snare
so
are
the
sons
of
men
snared
in
an
evil
time
when
it
falleth
suddenly
upon
them
9
13
this
wisdom
have
i
seen
also
under
the
sun
and
it
seemed
great
unto
me
9
14
there
was
a
little
city
and
few
men
within
it
and
there
came
a
great
king
against
it
and
besieged
it
and
built
great
bulwarks
against
it
9
15
now
there
was
found
in
it
a
poor
wise
man
and
he
by
his
wisdom
delivered
the
city
yet
no
man
remembered
that
same
poor
man
9
16
then
said
i
wisdom
is
better
than
strength
nevertheless
the
poor
man’s
wisdom
is
despised
and
his
words
are
not
heard
9
17
the
words
of
wise
men
are
heard
in
quiet
more
than
the
cry
of
him
that
ruleth
among
fools
9
18
wisdom
is
better
than
weapons
of
war
but
one
sinner
destroyeth
much
good
10
1
dead
flies
cause
the
ointment
of
the
apothecary
to
send
forth
a
stinking
savour
so
doth
a
little
folly
him
that
is
in
reputation
for
wisdom
and
honour
10
2
a
wise
man’s
heart
is
at
his
right
hand
but
a
fool’s
heart
at
his
left
10
3
yea
also
when
he
that
is
a
fool
walketh
by
the
way
his
wisdom
faileth
him
and
he
saith
to
every
one
that
he
is
a
fool
10
4
if
the
spirit
of
the
ruler
rise
up
against
thee
leave
not
thy
place
for
yielding
pacifieth
great
offences
10
5
there
is
an
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
as
an
error
which
proceedeth
from
the
ruler
10
6
folly
is
set
in
great
dignity
and
the
rich
sit
in
low
place
10
7
i
have
seen
servants
upon
horses
and
princes
walking
as
servants
upon
the
earth
10
8
he
that
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
into
it
and
whoso
breaketh
an
hedge
a
serpent
shall
bite
him
10
9
whoso
removeth
stones
shall
be
hurt
therewith
and
he
that
cleaveth
wood
shall
be
endangered
thereby
10
10
if
the
iron
be
blunt
and
he
do
not
whet
the
edge
then
must
he
put
to
more
strength
but
wisdom
is
profitable
to
direct
10
11
surely
the
serpent
will
bite
without
enchantment
and
a
babbler
is
no
better
10
12
the
words
of
a
wise
man’s
mouth
are
gracious
but
the
lips
of
a
fool
will
swallow
up
himself
10
13
the
beginning
of
the
words
of
his
mouth
is
foolishness
and
the
end
of
his
talk
is
mischievous
madness
10
14
a
fool
also
is
full
of
words
a
man
cannot
tell
what
shall
be
and
what
shall
be
after
him
who
can
tell
him
10
15
the
labour
of
the
foolish
wearieth
every
one
of
them
because
he
knoweth
not
how
to
go
to
the
city
10
16
woe
to
thee
o
land
when
thy
king
is
a
child
and
thy
princes

blessed
art
thou
o
land
when
thy
king
is
the
son
of
nobles
and
thy
princes
eat
in
due
season
for
strength
and
not
for
drunkenness
10
18
by
much
slothfulness
the
building
decayeth
and
through
idleness
of
the
hands
the
house
droppeth
through
10
19
a
feast
is
made
for
laughter
and
wine
maketh
merry
but
money
answereth
all
things
10

curse
not
the
king
no
not
in
thy
thought
and
curse
not
the
rich
in
thy
bedchamber
for
a
bird
of
the
air
shall
carry
the
voice
and
that
which
hath
wings
shall
tell
the
matter
11
1
cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
for
thou
shalt
find
it
after
many
days
11
2
give
a
portion
to
seven
and
also
to
eight
for
thou
knowest
not
what
evil
shall
be
upon
the
earth
11

if
the
clouds
be
full
of
rain
they
empty
themselves
upon
the
earth
and
if
the
tree
fall
toward
the
south
or
toward
the
north
in
the
place
where
the
tree
falleth
there
it
shall
be
11
4
he
that
observeth
the
wind
shall
not
sow
and
he
that
regardeth
the
clouds
shall
not
reap
11
5
as
thou
knowest
not
what
is
the
way
of
the
spirit
nor
how
the
bones
do
grow
in
the
womb
of
her
that
is
with
child
even
so
thou
knowest
not
the
works
of
god
who
maketh
all
11
6
in
the
morning
sow
thy
seed
and
in
the
evening
withhold
not
thine
hand
for
thou
knowest
not
whether
shall
prosper
either
this
or
that
or
whether
they
both
shall
be
alike
good
11
7
truly
the
light
is
sweet
and
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
for
the
eyes
to
behold
the
sun
11
8
but
if
a
man
live
many
years
and
rejoice
in
them
all
yet
let
him
remember
the
days
of
darkness
for
they
shall
be
many
all
that
cometh
is
vanity
11
9
rejoice
o
young
man
in
thy
youth
and
let
thy
heart
cheer
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
and
walk
in
the
ways
of
thine
heart
and
in
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
but
know
thou
that
for
all
these
things
god
will
bring
thee
into
judgment
11
10
therefore
remove
sorrow
from
thy
heart
and
put
away
evil
from
thy
flesh
for
childhood
and
youth
are
vanity
12
1
remember
now
thy
creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
while
the
evil
days
come
not
nor
the
years
draw
nigh
when
thou
shalt
say
i
have
no
pleasure
in
them
12
2
while
the
sun
or
the
light
or
the
moon
or
the
stars
be
not
darkened
nor
the
clouds
return
after
the
rain
12
3
in
the
day
when
the
keepers
of
the
house
shall
tremble
and
the
strong
men
shall
bow
themselves
and
the
grinders
cease
because
they
are
few
and
those
that
look
out
of
the
windows
be
darkened
12
4
and
the
doors
shall
be
shut
in
the
streets
when
the
sound
of
the
grinding
is
low
and
he
shall
rise
up
at
the
voice
of
the
bird
and
all
the
daughters
of
musick
shall
be
brought
low
12
5
also
when
they
shall
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high
and
fears
shall
be
in
the
way
and
the
almond
tree
shall
flourish
and
the
grasshopper
shall
be
a
burden
and
desire
shall
fail
because
man
goeth
to
his
long
home
and
the
mourners
go
about
the
streets
12
6
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain
or
the
wheel
broken
at
the
cistern
12
7
then
shall
the
dust
return
to
the
earth
as
it
was
and
the
spirit
shall
return
unto
god
who
gave
it
12
8
vanity
of
vanities
saith
the
preacher
all
is
vanity
12
9
and
moreover
because
the
preacher
was
wise
he
still
taught
the
people
knowledge
yea
he
gave
good
heed
and
sought
out
and
set
in
order
many
proverbs
12
10
the
preacher
sought
to
find
out
acceptable
words
and
that
which
was
written
was
upright
even
words
of
truth
12
11
the
words
of
the
wise
are
as
goads
and
as
nails
fastened
by
the
masters
of
assemblies
which
are
given
from
one
shepherd
12
12
and
further
by
these
my
son
be
admonished
of
making
many
books
there
is
no
end
and
much
study
is
a
weariness
of
the
flesh
12
13
let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man
12
14
for
god
shall
bring
every
work
into
judgment
with
every
secret
thing
whether
it
be
good
or
whether
it
be
evil
the
song
of
solomon
1

the
song
of
songs
which
is
solomon’s
1
2
let
him
kiss
me
with
the
kisses
of
his
mouth
for
thy
love
is
better
than
wine
1
3
because
of
the
savour
of
thy
good
ointments
thy
name
is
as
ointment
poured
forth
therefore
do
the
virgins
love
thee
1
4
draw
me
we
will
run
after
thee
the
king
hath
brought
me
into
his
chambers
we
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
thee
we
will
remember
thy
love
more
than
wine
the
upright
love
thee

looked
upon
me
my
mother’s
children
were
angry
with
me
they
made
me
the

tell
me
o
thou
whom
my
soul
loveth
where
thou
feedest
where
thou
makest
thy
flock
to
rest
at
noon
for
why

i
be
as
one
that
turneth
aside
by
the
flocks
of
thy
companions
1

if
thou
know
not

fairest
among

tents

compared
thee
o
my

to
a
company
of
horses

comely
with
rows
of
jewels

neck
with

of
gold

we
will
make
thee
borders
of
gold
with
studs
of
silver

sitteth
at

spikenard
sendeth

vehement
flame
8

many
waters

it
would
utterly
be
contemned
8

we

we
will
inclose
her
with
boards
of
cedar
8

i
am
a
wall

solomon

a
vineyard
at

he
let
out
the

8
12
my
vineyard
which

mine
is
before
me
thou
o

must
have
a
thousand
and
those
that
keep
the
fruit
thereof
two
hundred
8
13
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
gardens
the
companions
hearken
to
thy
voice
cause
me
to
hear
it
8
14
make
haste
my
beloved
and
be
thou
like
to
a
roe
or
to
a
young
hart
upon
the
mountains
of
spices
the
book
of
the
prophet
isaiah
1

the
vision
of

the
son
of

he
saw

1

hear
o
heavens
and
give
ear
o
earth
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
i
have
nourished
and
brought
up
children
and
they
have
rebelled
against
me
1

the
ox
knoweth
his
owner
and
the
ass
his
master’s
crib
but
israel
doth
not
know
my
people
doth
not
consider
1

ah
sinful
nation
a
people
laden
with
iniquity
a
seed
of
evildoers
children
that
are
corrupters
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
they
have
provoked
the
holy
one
of
israel
unto
anger
they
are
gone
away
backward
1
5
why
should
ye
be
stricken
any
more
ye
will
revolt
more
and
more
the
whole
head
is
sick
and
the
whole
heart
faint
1
6
from
the
sole
of
the
foot
even
unto
the
head
there
is
no
soundness
in
it
but
wounds
and
bruises
and
putrifying
sores
they
have
not
been
closed
neither
bound
up
neither
mollified
with
ointment
1
7
your
country
is
desolate
your
cities
are
burned
with
fire
your
land
strangers
devour
it
in
your
presence
and
it
is
desolate
as
overthrown
by
strangers
1
8
and
the
daughter
of
zion
is
left
as
a
cottage
in
a
vineyard
as
a
lodge
in
a
garden
of
cucumbers
as
a
besieged
city
1
9
except
the
lord
of
hosts
had
left
unto
us
a
very
small
remnant
we
should
have
been
as
sodom
and
we
should
have
been
like
unto
gomorrah
1
10
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
rulers
of
sodom
give
ear
unto
the
law
of
our
god
ye
people
of
gomorrah
1
11
to
what
purpose
is
the
multitude
of
your
sacrifices
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
am
full
of
the
burnt
offerings
of
rams
and
the
fat
of
fed
beasts
and
i
delight
not
in
the
blood
of
bullocks
or
of
lambs
or
of
he
goats
1
12
when
ye
come
to
appear
before
me
who
hath
required
this
at
your
hand
to
tread
my
courts
1
13
bring
no
more
vain
oblations
incense
is
an
abomination
unto
me
the
new
moons
and
sabbaths
the
calling
of
assemblies
i
cannot
away
with
it
is
iniquity
even
the
solemn
meeting
1
14
your
new
moons
and
your
appointed
feasts
my
soul
hateth
they
are
a
trouble
unto
me
i
am
weary
to
bear
them
1
15
and
when
ye
spread
forth
your
hands
i
will
hide
mine
eyes
from
you
yea
when
ye
make
many
prayers
i
will
not
hear
your
hands
are
full
of
blood
1
16
wash
you
make
you
clean
put
away
the
evil
of
your
doings
from
before
mine
eyes
cease
to
do
evil
1
17
learn
to
do
well
seek
judgment
relieve
the
oppressed
judge
the
fatherless

for
the
widow
1
18
come
now
and
let
us
reason
together
saith
the
lord
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
like
crimson
they
shall
be
as
wool
1
19
if
ye
be
willing
and
obedient
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
1
20
but
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel
ye
shall
be
devoured
with
the
sword
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
1
21
how
is
the
faithful
city
become
an
harlot
it
was
full
of
judgment
righteousness
lodged
in
it
but
now
murderers
1
22
thy
silver
is
become
dross
thy
wine
mixed
with
water
1
23
thy
princes
are
rebellious
and
companions
of
thieves
every
one
loveth
gifts
and
followeth
after
rewards
they
judge
not
the
fatherless
neither
doth
the
cause
of
the
widow
come
unto
them
1
24
therefore
saith
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
the
mighty
one
of
israel
ah
i
will
ease
me
of
mine
adversaries
and
avenge
me
of
mine
enemies
1
25
and
i
will
turn
my
hand
upon
thee
and
purely
purge
away
thy
dross
and
take
away
all
thy
tin
1
26
and
i
will
restore
thy
judges
as
at
the
first
and
thy
counsellors
as
at
the
beginning
afterward
thou
shalt
be
called
the
city
of
righteousness
the
faithful
city
1
27
zion
shall
be
redeemed
with
judgment
and
her
converts
with
righteousness
1
28
and
the
destruction
of
the
transgressors
and
of
the
sinners
shall
be
together
and
they
that
forsake
the
lord
shall
be
consumed
1
29
for
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
the
oaks
which
ye
have
desired
and
ye
shall
be
confounded
for
the
gardens
that
ye
have
chosen
1
30
for
ye
shall
be
as
an
oak
whose
leaf
fadeth
and
as
a
garden
that
hath
no
water
1
31
and
the
strong
shall
be
as
tow
and
the
maker
of
it
as
a
spark
and
they
shall
both
burn
together
and
none
shall
quench
them
2
1
the
word
that
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
saw
concerning
judah
and
jerusalem
2
2
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
that
the
mountain
of
the
lord’s
house
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills
and
all
nations
shall
flow
unto
it
2
3
and
many
people
shall
go
and
say
come
ye
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
lord
to
the
house
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
for
out
of
zion
shall
go
forth
the
law
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
2
4
and
he
shall
judge
among
the
nations
and
shall
rebuke
many
people
and
they
shall
beat
their
swords
into
plowshares
and
their
spears
into
pruninghooks
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more
2
5
o
house
of
jacob
come
ye
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
lord
2
6
therefore
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people
the
house
of
jacob
because
they
be
replenished
from
the
east
and
are
soothsayers
like
the
philistines
and
they
please
themselves
in
the
children
of
strangers
2
7
their
land
also
is
full
of
silver
and
gold
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
treasures
their
land
is
also
full
of
horses
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
chariots
2
8
their
land
also
is
full
of
idols
they
worship
the
work
of
their
own
hands
that
which
their
own
fingers
have
made
2
9
and
the
mean
man
boweth
down
and
the
great
man
humbleth
himself
therefore
forgive
them
not
2
10
enter
into
the
rock
and
hide
thee
in
the
dust
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty
2
11
the
lofty
looks
of
man
shall
be
humbled
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
bowed
down
and
the
lord
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day
2
12
for
the
day
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
be
upon
every
one
that
is
proud
and
lofty
and
upon
every
one
that
is
lifted
up
and
he
shall
be
brought
low
2
13
and
upon
all
the
cedars
of
lebanon
that
are
high
and
lifted
up
and
upon
all
the
oaks
of
bashan
2
14

upon
all
the

upon

the
ships
of

the
loftiness

be
bowed
down

the
haughtiness
of

shall
be
made
low
and
the
lord
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day
2
18
and
the
idols
he
shall
utterly
abolish
2
19
and
they
shall
go
into
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
into
the
caves
of
the
earth
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth
2
20
in
that
day
a
man
shall
cast
his
idols
of
silver
and
his
idols
of
gold
which
they
made
each
one
for
himself
to
worship
to
the
moles
and
to
the
bats
2
21
to
go
into
the
clefts

rocks

into
the
tops

the
ragged
rocks
for

cease

accounted
of

for
behold
the

the
lord
of

doth
take
away
from

the

the
whole
stay
of

the
captain
of
fifty
and
the
honourable
man
and
the
counsellor
and
the
cunning
artificer
and
the
eloquent
orator
3
4
and
i
will
give
children
to
be
their
princes
and
babes
shall
rule
over
them
3
5
and
the
people
shall
be
oppressed
every
one
by
another
and
every
one
by
his
neighbour
the
child
shall
behave
himself
proudly
against
the
ancient
and
the
base
against
the
honourable
3

when
a
man
shall
take
hold
of
his
brother
of
the
house
of
his
father
saying
thou
hast
clothing
be
thou
our
ruler
and
let
this
ruin
be
under
thy
hand
3
7
in
that
day
shall
he
swear
saying
i
will
not
be
an
healer
for
in
my
house
is
neither
bread
nor
clothing
make
me
not
a
ruler
of
the
people
3
8
for
jerusalem
is
ruined
and
judah
is
fallen
because
their
tongue
and
their
doings
are
against
the
lord
to
provoke
the
eyes
of
his
glory
3
9
the
shew
of
their
countenance
doth
witness
against
them
and
they
declare
their
sin
as
sodom
they
hide
it
not
woe
unto
their
soul
for
they
have
rewarded
evil
unto
themselves
3
10
say
ye
to
the
righteous
that
it
shall
be
well
with
him
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings
3
11
woe
unto
the
wicked
it
shall
be
ill
with
him
for
the
reward
of
his
hands
shall
be
given
him
3
12
as
for
my
people
children
are
their
oppressors
and
women
rule
over
them
o
my
people
they
which
lead
thee
cause
thee
to
err
and
destroy
the
way
of
thy
paths
3
13
the
lord
standeth
up
to
plead
and
standeth
to
judge
the
people
3
14
the
lord
will
enter
into
judgment
with
the
ancients
of
his
people
and
the
princes
thereof
for
ye
have
eaten
up
the
vineyard
the
spoil
of
the
poor
is
in
your
houses
3
15
what
mean
ye
that
ye
beat
my
people
to
pieces
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
3
16
moreover
the
lord
saith
because
the
daughters
of
zion
are
haughty
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet
3
17
therefore
the
lord
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
the
lord
will
discover
their
secret
parts
3
18
in
that
day
the
lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
3
19
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
3
20
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
earrings
3
21
the
rings
and
nose
jewels
3
22
the
changeable
suits
of
apparel
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
3
23
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
hoods
and
the
vails
3
24
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
instead
of
sweet
smell
there
shall
be
stink
and
instead
of
a
girdle
a
rent
and
instead
of
well
set
hair
baldness
and
instead
of
a
stomacher
a
girding
of
sackcloth
and
burning
instead
of
beauty
3
25
thy
men
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
mighty
in
the
war
3
26
and
her
gates
shall
lament
and
mourn
and
she
being
desolate
shall
sit
upon
the
ground
4
1
and
in
that
day
seven
women
shall
take
hold
of
one
man
saying
we
will
eat
our
own
bread
and
wear
our
own
apparel
only
let
us
be
called
by
thy
name
to
take
away
our
reproach
4
2
in
that
day
shall
the
branch
of
the
lord
be
beautiful
and
glorious
and
the
fruit
of
the
earth
shall
be
excellent
and
comely
for
them
that
are
escaped
of
israel
4
3
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
he
that
is
left
in
zion
and
he
that
remaineth
in
jerusalem
shall
be
called
holy
even
every
one
that
is
written
among
the
living
in
jerusalem
4
4
when
the
lord
shall
have
washed
away
the
filth
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
shall
have
purged
the
blood
of
jerusalem
from
the
midst
thereof
by
the
spirit
of
judgment
and
by
the
spirit
of
burning
4
5
and
the
lord
will
create
upon
every
dwelling
place
of
mount
zion
and
upon
her
assemblies
a
cloud
and
smoke
by
day
and
the
shining
of
a
flaming
fire
by
night
for
upon
all
the
glory
shall
be
a
defence
4
6
and
there
shall
be
a
tabernacle
for
a
shadow
in
the
day
time
from
the
heat
and
for
a
place
of
refuge
and
for
a
covert
from
storm
and
from
rain
5
1
now
will
i
sing
to
my
wellbeloved
a
song
of
my
beloved
touching
his
vineyard
my
wellbeloved
hath
a
vineyard
in
a
very
fruitful
hill
5
2
and
he
fenced
it
and
gathered
out
the
stones
thereof
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine
and
built
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
it
and
also
made
a
winepress
therein
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
and
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes
5
3
and
now
o
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
men
of
judah
judge
i
pray
you
betwixt
me
and
my
vineyard
5
4
what
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard
that
i
have
not
done
in
it
wherefore
when
i
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
brought
it
forth
wild
grapes
5
5
and
now
go
to
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
to
my
vineyard
i
will
take
away
the
hedge
thereof
and
it
shall
be
eaten
up
and
break
down
the
wall
thereof
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down
5
6
and
i
will
lay
it
waste
it
shall
not
be
pruned
nor
digged
but
there
shall
come
up
briers
and
thorns
i
will
also
command
the
clouds
that
they
rain
no
rain
upon
it
5
7
for
the
vineyard
of
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
house
of
israel
and
the
men
of
judah
his
pleasant
plant
and
he
looked
for
judgment
but
behold
oppression
for
righteousness
but
behold
a
cry
5
8
woe
unto
them
that
join
house
to
house
that
lay
field
to
field
till
there
be
no
place
that
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
5
9
in
mine
ears
said
the
lord
of
hosts
of
a
truth
many
houses
shall
be
desolate
even
great
and
fair
without
inhabitant
5
10
yea
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
one
bath
and
the
seed
of
an
homer
shall
yield
an
ephah
5
11
woe
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
that
continue
until
night
till
wine
inflame
them
5
12
and
the
harp
and
the
viol
the
tabret
and
pipe
and
wine
are
in
their
feasts
but
they
regard
not
the
work
of
the
lord
neither
consider
the
operation
of
his
hands
5
13
therefore
my
people
are
gone
into
captivity
because
they
have
no
knowledge
and
their
honourable
men
are
famished
and
their
multitude
dried
up
with
thirst
5
14
therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure
and
their
glory
and
their
multitude
and
their
pomp
and
he
that
rejoiceth
shall
descend
into
it
5
15
and
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall
be
humbled
5
16
but
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment
and
god
that
is
holy
shall
be
sanctified
in
righteousness
5
17
then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
their
manner
and
the
waste
places
of
the
fat
ones
shall
strangers
eat
5
18
woe
unto
them
that
draw
iniquity
with
cords
of
vanity
and
sin
as
it
were
with
a
cart
rope
5
19
that
say
let
him
make
speed
and
hasten
his
work
that
we
may
see
it
and
let
the
counsel
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
draw
nigh
and
come
that
we
may
know
it
5
20
woe
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
that
put
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
that
put
bitter
for
sweet
and
sweet
for
bitter
5
21
woe
unto
them
that
are
wise
in
their
own
eyes
and
prudent
in
their
own
sight
5
22
woe
unto
them
that
are
mighty
to
drink
wine
and
men
of
strength
to
mingle
strong
drink
5
23
which
justify
the
wicked
for
reward
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him
5
24
therefore
as
the
fire
devoureth
the
stubble
and
the
flame
consumeth
the
chaff
so
their
root
shall
be
as
rottenness
and
their
blossom
shall
go
up
as
dust
because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
despised
the
word
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
5
25
therefore
is
the
anger
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his
hand
against
them
and
hath
smitten
them
and
the
hills
did
tremble
and
their
carcases
were
torn
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
5
26
and
he
will
lift
up
an
ensign
to
the
nations
from
far
and
will
hiss
unto
them
from
the
end
of
the
earth
and
behold
they
shall
come
with
speed
swiftly
5
27
none
shall
be
weary
nor
stumble
among
them
none
shall
slumber
nor
sleep
neither
shall
the
girdle
of
their
loins
be
loosed
nor
the
latchet
of
their
shoes
be
broken
5
28
whose
arrows
are
sharp
and
all
their
bows
bent
their
horses’
hoofs
shall
be
counted
like
flint
and
their
wheels
like
a
whirlwind
5
29
their
roaring
shall
be
like
a
lion
they
shall
roar
like
young
lions
yea
they
shall
roar
and
lay
hold
of
the
prey
and
shall
carry
it
away
safe
and
none
shall
deliver
it
5
30
and
in
that
day
they
shall
roar
against
them
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
if
one
look
unto
the
land
behold
darkness
and
sorrow
and
the
light
is
darkened
in
the
heavens
thereof
6
1
in
the
year
that
king
uzziah
died
i
saw
also
the
lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
high
and
lifted
up
and
his
train
filled
the
temple
6
2
above
it
stood
the
seraphims
each
one
had
six
wings
with
twain
he
covered
his
face
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
and
with
twain
he
did
fly
6
3
and
one
cried
unto
another
and
said
holy
holy
holy
is
the
lord
of
hosts
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory
6
4
and
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
6
5
then
said
i
woe
is
me
for
i
am
undone
because
i
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips
and
i
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
6
6
then
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me
having
a
live
coal
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar
6
7
and
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth
and
said
lo
this
hath
touched
thy
lips
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
and
thy
sin
purged
6
8
also
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
whom
shall
i
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
then
said
i
here
am
i
send
me
6
9
and
he
said
go
and
tell
this
people
hear
ye
indeed
but
understand
not
and
see
ye
indeed
but
perceive
not
6
10
make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat
and
make
their
ears
heavy
and
shut
their
eyes
lest
they
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
convert
and
be
healed
6
11
then
said
i
lord
how
long
and
he
answered
until
the
cities
be
wasted
without
inhabitant
and
the
houses
without
man
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate
6
12
and
the
lord
have
removed
men
far
away
and
there
be
a
great
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
land
6
13
but
yet
in
it
shall
be
a
tenth
and
it
shall
return
and
shall
be
eaten
as
a
teil
tree
and
as
an
oak
whose
substance
is
in
them
when
they
cast
their
leaves
so
the
holy
seed
shall
be
the
substance
thereof
7
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
ahaz
the
son
of
jotham
the
son
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
that
rezin
the
king
of
syria
and
pekah
the
son
of
remaliah
king
of
israel
went
up
toward
jerusalem
to
war
against
it
but
could
not
prevail
against
it
7
2
and
it
was
told
the
house
of
david
saying
syria
is
confederate
with
ephraim
and
his
heart
was
moved
and
the
heart
of
his
people
as
the
trees
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind
7
3
then
said
the
lord
unto
isaiah
go
forth
now
to
meet
ahaz
thou
and
shearjashub
thy
son
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller’s
field
7
4
and
say
unto
him
take
heed
and
be
quiet
fear
not
neither
be
fainthearted
for
the
two
tails
of
these
smoking
firebrands
for
the
fierce
anger
of
rezin
with
syria
and
of
the
son
of
remaliah
7
5
because
syria
ephraim
and
the
son
of
remaliah
have
taken
evil
counsel
against
thee
saying
7
6
let
us
go
up
against
judah
and
vex
it
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it
even
the
son
of
tabeal
7
7
thus
saith
the
lord
god
it
shall
not
stand
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass
7
8
for
the
head
of
syria
is
damascus
and
the
head
of
damascus
is
rezin
and
within
threescore
and
five
years
shall
ephraim
be
broken
that
it
be
not
a
people
7
9
and
the
head
of
ephraim
is
samaria
and
the
head
of
samaria
is
remaliah’s
son
if
ye
will
not
believe
surely
ye
shall
not
be
established
7
10
moreover
the
lord
spake
again
unto
ahaz
saying
7
11
ask
thee
a
sign
of
the
lord
thy
god
ask
it
either
in
the
depth
or
in
the
height
above
7
12
but
ahaz
said
i
will
not
ask
neither
will
i
tempt
the
lord
7
13
and
he
said
hear
ye
now
o
house
of
david
is
it
a
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men
but
will
ye
weary
my
god
also
7
14
therefore
the
lord
himself
shall
give
you
a
sign
behold
a
virgin
shall
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
shall
call
his
name
immanuel
7
15
butter
and
honey
shall
he
eat
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
7
16
for
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
forsaken
of
both
her
kings
7
17
the
lord
shall
bring
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
father’s
house
days
that
have
not
come
from
the
day
that
ephraim
departed
from
judah
even
the
king
of
assyria
7
18
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
hiss
for
the
fly
that
is
in
the
uttermost
part
of
the
rivers
of
egypt
and
for
the
bee
that
is
in
the
land
of
assyria
7
19
and
they
shall
come
and
shall
rest
all
of
them
in
the
desolate
valleys
and
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
upon
all
thorns
and
upon
all
bushes
7
20
in
the
same
day
shall
the
lord
shave
with
a
razor
that
is
hired
namely
by
them
beyond
the
river
by
the
king
of
assyria
the
head
and
the
hair
of
the
feet
and
it
shall
also
consume
the
beard
7
21
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
a
man
shall
nourish
a
young
cow
and
two
sheep
7
22
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
for
the
abundance
of
milk
that
they
shall
give
he
shall
eat
butter
for
butter
and
honey
shall
every
one
eat
that
is
left
in
the
land
7
23
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
every
place
shall
be
where
there
were
a
thousand
vines
at
a
thousand
silverlings
it
shall
even
be
for
briers
and
thorns
7
24
with
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
thither
because
all
the
land
shall
become
briers
and
thorns
7
25
and
on
all
hills
that
shall
be
digged
with
the
mattock
there
shall
not
come
thither
the
fear
of
briers
and
thorns
but
it
shall
be
for
the
sending
forth
of
oxen
and
for
the
treading
of
lesser
cattle
8
1
moreover
the
lord
said
unto
me
take
thee
a
great
roll
and
write
in
it
with
a
man’s
pen
concerning
mahershalalhashbaz
8
2
and
i
took
unto
me
faithful
witnesses
to
record
uriah
the
priest
and
zechariah
the
son
of
jeberechiah
8
3
and
i
went
unto
the
prophetess
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
then
said
the
lord
to
me
call
his
name
mahershalalhashbaz
8
4
for
before
the
child
shall
have
knowledge
to
cry
my
father
and
my
mother
the
riches
of
damascus
and
the
spoil
of
samaria
shall
be
taken
away
before
the
king
of
assyria
8
5
the
lord
spake
also
unto
me
again
saying
8
6
forasmuch
as
this
people
refuseth
the
waters
of
shiloah
that
go
softly
and
rejoice
in
rezin
and
remaliah’s
son
8
7
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
bringeth
up
upon
them
the
waters
of
the
river
strong
and
many
even
the
king
of
assyria
and
all
his
glory
and
he
shall
come
up
over
all
his
channels
and
go
over
all
his
banks
8
8
and
he
shall
pass
through
judah
he
shall
overflow
and
go
over
he
shall
reach
even
to
the
neck
and
the
stretching
out
of
his
wings
shall
fill
the
breadth
of
thy
land
o
immanuel
8
9
associate
yourselves
o
ye
people
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
and
give
ear
all
ye
of
far
countries
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
8
10
take
counsel
together
and
it
shall
come
to
nought
speak
the
word
and
it
shall
not
stand
for
god
is
with
us
8
11
for
the
lord
spake
thus
to
me
with
a
strong
hand
and
instructed
me
that
i
should
not
walk
in
the
way
of
this
people
saying
8
12
say
ye
not
a
confederacy
to
all
them
to
whom
this
people
shall
say
a
confederacy
neither
fear
ye
their
fear
nor
be
afraid
8
13
sanctify
the
lord
of
hosts
himself
and
let
him
be
your
fear
and
let
him
be
your
dread
8
14
and
he
shall
be
for
a
sanctuary
but
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
offence
to
both
the
houses
of
israel
for
a
gin
and
for
a
snare
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
8
15
and
many
among
them
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
be
broken
and
be
snared
and
be
taken
8
16
bind
up
the
testimony
seal
the
law
among
my
disciples
8
17
and
i
will
wait
upon
the
lord
that
hideth
his
face
from
the
house
of
jacob
and
i
will
look
for
him
8
18
behold
i
and
the
children
whom
the
lord
hath
given
me
are
for
signs
and
for
wonders
in
israel
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
dwelleth
in
mount
zion
8
19
and
when
they
shall
say
unto
you
seek
unto
them
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
unto
wizards
that
peep
and
that
mutter
should
not
a
people
seek
unto
their
god
for
the
living
to
the
dead
8
20
to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word
it
is
because
there
is
no
light
in
them
8
21
and
they
shall
pass
through
it
hardly
bestead
and
hungry
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
be
hungry
they
shall
fret
themselves
and
curse
their
king
and
their
god
and
look
upward
8
22
and
they
shall
look
unto
the
earth
and
behold
trouble
and
darkness
dimness
of
anguish
and
they
shall
be
driven
to
darkness
9
1
nevertheless
the
dimness
shall
not
be
such
as
was
in
her
vexation
when
at
the
first
he
lightly
afflicted
the
land
of
zebulun
and
the
land
of
naphtali
and
afterward
did
more
grievously
afflict
her
by
the
way
of
the
sea
beyond
jordan
in
galilee
of
the
nations
9
2
the
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined
9
3
thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation
and
not
increased
the
joy
they
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest
and
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
spoil
9
4
for
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder
the
rod
of
his
oppressor
as
in
the
day
of
midian
9
5
for
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
fuel
of
fire
9
6
for
unto
us
a
child
is
born
unto
us
a
son
is
given
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
name
shall
be
called
wonderful
counsellor
the
mighty
god
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace
9
7
of
the
increase
of
his
government
and
peace
there
shall
be
no
end
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
upon
his
kingdom
to
order
it
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
will
perform
this
9
8
the
lord
sent
a
word
into
jacob
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
israel
9
9
and
all
the
people
shall
know
even
ephraim
and
the
inhabitant
of
samaria
that
say
in
the
pride
and
stoutness
of
heart
9
10
the
bricks
are
fallen
down
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones
the
sycomores
are
cut
down
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars
9
11
therefore
the
lord
shall
set
up
the
adversaries
of
rezin
against
him
and
join
his
enemies
together
9
12
the
syrians
before
and
the
philistines
behind
and
they
shall
devour
israel
with
open
mouth
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
9
13
for
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them
neither
do
they
seek
the
lord
of
hosts
9
14
therefore
the
lord
will
cut
off
from
israel
head
and
tail
branch
and
rush
in
one
day
9
15
the
ancient
and
honourable
he
is
the
head
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies
he
is
the
tail
9
16
for
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
to
err
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed
9
17
therefore
the
lord
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men
neither
shall
have
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows
for
every
one
is
an
hypocrite
and
an
evildoer
and
every
mouth
speaketh
folly
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
9
18
for
wickedness
burneth
as
the
fire
it
shall
devour
the
briers
and
thorns
and
shall
kindle
in
the
thickets
of
the
forest
and
they
shall
mount
up
like
the
lifting
up
of
smoke
9
19
through
the
wrath
of
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
land
darkened
and
the
people
shall
be
as
the
fuel
of
the
fire
no
man
shall
spare
his
brother
9
20
and
he
shall
snatch
on
the
right
hand
and
be
hungry
and
he
shall
eat
on
the
left
hand
and
they
shall
not
be
satisfied
they
shall
eat
every
man
the
flesh
of
his
own
arm
9
21
manasseh
ephraim
and
ephraim
manasseh
and
they
together
shall
be
against
judah
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
10
1
woe
unto
them
that
decree
unrighteous
decrees
and
that
write
grievousness
which
they
have
prescribed
10
2
to
turn
aside
the
needy
from
judgment
and
to
take
away
the
right
from
the
poor
of
my
people
that
widows
may
be
their
prey
and
that
they
may
rob
the
fatherless
10
3
and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
day
of
visitation
and
in
the
desolation
which
shall
come
from
far
to
whom
will
ye
flee
for
help
and
where
will
ye
leave
your
glory
10
4
without
me
they
shall
bow
down
under
the
prisoners
and
they
shall
fall
under
the
slain
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
10
5
o
assyrian
the
rod
of
mine
anger
and
the
staff
in
their
hand
is
mine
indignation
10
6
i
will
send
him
against
an
hypocritical
nation
and
against
the
people
of
my
wrath
will
i
give
him
a
charge
to
take
the
spoil
and
to
take
the
prey
and
to
tread
them
down
like
the
mire
of
the
streets
10
7
howbeit
he
meaneth
not
so
neither
doth
his
heart
think
so
but
it
is
in
his
heart
to
destroy
and
cut
off
nations
not
a
few
10
8
for
he
saith
are
not
my
princes
altogether
kings
10
9
is
not
calno
as
carchemish
is
not
hamath
as
arpad
is
not
samaria
as
damascus
10
10
as
my
hand
hath
found
the
kingdoms
of
the
idols
and
whose
graven
images
did
excel
them
of
jerusalem
and
of
samaria
10
11
shall
i
not
as
i
have
done
unto
samaria
and
her
idols
so
do
to
jerusalem
and
her
idols
10
12
wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
zion
and
on
jerusalem
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
10
13
for
he
saith
by
the
strength
of
my
hand
i
have
done
it
and
by
my
wisdom
for
i
am
prudent
and
i
have
removed
the
bounds
of
the
people
and
have
robbed
their
treasures
and
i
have
put
down
the
inhabitants
like
a
valiant
man
10
14
and
my
hand
hath
found
as
a
nest
the
riches
of
the
people
and
as
one
gathereth
eggs
that
are
left
have
i
gathered
all
the
earth
and
there
was
none
that
moved
the
wing
or
opened
the
mouth
or
peeped
10
15
shall
the
axe
boast
itself
against
him
that
heweth
therewith
or
shall
the
saw
magnify
itself
against
him
that
shaketh
it
as
if
the
rod
should
shake
itself
against
them
that
lift
it
up
or
as
if
the
staff
should
lift
up
itself
as
if
it
were
no
wood
10
16
therefore
shall
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
send
among
his
fat
ones
leanness
and
under
his
glory
he
shall
kindle
a
burning
like
the
burning
of
a
fire
10
17
and
the
light
of
israel
shall
be
for
a
fire
and
his
holy
one
for
a
flame
and
it
shall
burn
and
devour
his
thorns
and
his
briers
in
one
day
10
18
and
shall
consume
the
glory
of
his
forest
and
of
his
fruitful
field
both
soul
and
body
and
they
shall
be
as
when
a
standard-bearer
fainteth
10
19
and
the
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forest
shall
be
few
that
a
child
may
write
them
10
20
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
remnant
of
israel
and
such
as
are
escaped
of
the
house
of
jacob
shall
no
more
again
stay
upon
him
that
smote
them
but
shall
stay
upon
the
lord
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
truth
10
21
the
remnant
shall
return
even
the
remnant
of
jacob
unto
the
mighty
god
10
22
for
though
thy
people
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
yet
a
remnant
of
them
shall
return
the
consumption
decreed
shall
overflow
with
righteousness
10
23
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
shall
make
a
consumption
even
determined
in
the
midst
of
all
the
land
10
24
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
o
my
people
that
dwellest
in
zion
be
not
afraid
of
the
assyrian
he
shall
smite
thee
with
a
rod
and
shall
lift
up
his
staff
against
thee
after
the
manner
of
egypt
10
25
for
yet
a
very
little
while
and
the
indignation
shall
cease
and
mine
anger
in
their
destruction
10
26
and
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
stir
up
a
scourge
for
him
according
to
the
slaughter
of
midian
at
the
rock
of
oreb
and
as
his
rod
was
upon
the
sea
so
shall
he
lift
it
up
after
the
manner
of
egypt
10
27
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
his
burden
shall
be
taken
away
from
off
thy
shoulder
and
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
and
the
yoke
shall
be
destroyed
because
of
the
anointing
10
28
he
is
come
to
aiath
he
is
passed
to
migron
at
michmash
he
hath
laid
up
his
carriages
10
29
they
are
gone
over
the
passage
they
have
taken
up
their
lodging
at
geba
ramah
is
afraid
gibeah
of
saul
is
fled
10
30
lift
up
thy
voice
o
daughter
of
gallim
cause
it
to
be
heard
unto
laish
o
poor
anathoth
10
31
madmenah
is
removed
the
inhabitants
of
gebim
gather
themselves
to
flee
10
32
as
yet
shall
he
remain
at
nob
that
day
he
shall
shake
his
hand
against
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
zion
the
hill
of
jerusalem
10
33
behold
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
lop
the
bough
with
terror
and
the
high
ones
of
stature
shall
be
hewn
down
and
the
haughty
shall
be
humbled
10
34
and
he
shall
cut
down
the
thickets
of
the
forest
with
iron
and
lebanon
shall
fall
by
a
mighty
one
11
1
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
jesse
and
a
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
11
2
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
him
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
11
3
and
shall
make
him
of
quick
understanding
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes
neither
reprove
after
the
hearing
of
his
ears
11

but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
11
5
and
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
11

the
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
11
7
and
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox
11
8
and
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice’
den
11
9
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
11
10
and
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
which
shall
stand
for
an
ensign
of
the
people
to
it
shall
the
gentiles
seek
and
his
rest
shall
be
glorious
11
11
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left
from
assyria
and
from
egypt
and
from
pathros
and
from
cush
and
from
elam
and
from
shinar
and
from
hamath
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea
11
12
and
he
shall
set
up
an
ensign
for
the
nations
and
shall
assemble
the
outcasts
of
israel
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
11
13
the
envy
also
of
ephraim
shall
depart
and
the
adversaries
of
judah
shall
be
cut
off
ephraim
shall
not
envy
judah
and
judah
shall
not
vex
ephraim
11
14
but
they
shall
fly
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
philistines
toward
the
west
they
shall
spoil
them
of
the
east
together
they
shall
lay
their
hand
upon
edom
and
moab
and
the
children
of
ammon
shall
obey
them
11
15
and
the
lord
shall
utterly
destroy
the
tongue
of
the
egyptian
sea
and
with
his
mighty
wind
shall
he
shake
his
hand
over
the
river
and
shall
smite
it
in
the
seven
streams
and
make
men
go
over
dryshod
11
16
and
there
shall
be
an
highway
for
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left
from
assyria
like
as
it
was
to
israel
in
the
day
that
he
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
12
1
and
in
that
day
thou
shalt
say
o
lord
i
will
praise
thee
though
thou
wast
angry
with
me
thine
anger
is
turned
away
and
thou
comfortedst
me
12
2
behold
god
is
my
salvation
i
will
trust
and
not
be
afraid
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
my
strength
and
my
song
he
also
is
become
my
salvation
12
3
therefore
with
joy
shall
ye
draw
water
out
of
the
wells
of
salvation
12
4
and
in
that
day
shall
ye
say
praise
the
lord
call
upon
his
name
declare
his
doings
among
the
people
make
mention
that
his
name
is
exalted
12
5
sing
unto
the
lord
for
he
hath
done
excellent
things
this
is
known
in
all
the
earth
12

cry
out
and
shout
thou
inhabitant
of
zion
for
great
is
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
the
midst
of
thee
13
1
the
burden
of
babylon
which
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
did
see
13
2
lift
ye
up
a
banner
upon
the
high
mountain
exalt
the
voice
unto
them
shake
the
hand
that
they
may
go
into
the
gates
of
the
nobles
13
3
i
have
commanded
my
sanctified
ones
i
have
also
called
my
mighty
ones
for
mine
anger
even
them
that
rejoice
in
my
highness
13
4
the
noise
of
a
multitude
in
the
mountains
like
as
of
a
great
people
a
tumultuous
noise
of
the
kingdoms
of
nations
gathered
together
the
lord
of
hosts
mustereth
the
host
of
the
battle
13
5
they
come
from
a
far
country
from
the
end
of
heaven
even
the
lord
and
the
weapons
of
his
indignation
to
destroy
the
whole
land
13
6
howl
ye
for
the
day
of
the
lord
is
at
hand
it
shall
come
as
a
destruction
from
the
almighty
13
7
therefore
shall
all
hands
be
faint
and
every
man’s
heart
shall
melt
13
8
and
they
shall
be
afraid
pangs
and
sorrows
shall
take
hold
of
them
they
shall
be
in
pain
as
a
woman
that
travaileth
they
shall
be
amazed
one
at
another
their
faces
shall
be
as
flames
13
9
behold
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
cruel
both
with
wrath
and
fierce
anger
to
lay
the
land
desolate
and
he
shall
destroy
the
sinners
thereof
out
of
it
13
10
for
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
constellations
thereof
shall
not
give
their
light
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
in
his
going
forth
and
the
moon
shall
not
cause
her
light
to
shine
13
11
and
i
will
punish
the
world
for
their
evil
and
the
wicked
for
their
iniquity
and
i
will
cause
the
arrogancy
of
the
proud
to
cease
and
will
lay
low
the
haughtiness
of
the
terrible
13
12
i
will
make
a
man
more
precious
than
fine
gold
even
a
man
than
the
golden
wedge
of
ophir
13
13
therefore
i
will
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
shall
remove
out
of
her
place
in
the
wrath
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
in
the
day
of
his
fierce
anger
13
14
and
it
shall
be
as
the
chased
roe
and
as
a
sheep
that
no
man
taketh
up
they
shall
every
man
turn
to
his
own
people
and
flee
every
one
into
his
own
land
13
15
every
one
that
is
found
shall
be
thrust
through
and
every
one
that
is
joined
unto
them
shall
fall
by
the
sword
13
16
their
children
also
shall
be
dashed
to
pieces
before
their
eyes
their
houses
shall
be
spoiled
and
their
wives
ravished
13
17
behold
i
will
stir
up
the
medes
against
them
which
shall
not
regard
silver
and
as
for
gold
they
shall
not
delight
in
it
13
18
their
bows
also
shall
dash
the
young
men
to
pieces
and
they
shall
have
no
pity
on
the
fruit
of
the
womb
their
eyes
shall
not
spare
children
13
19
and
babylon
the
glory
of
kingdoms
the
beauty
of
the
chaldees’
excellency
shall
be
as
when
god
overthrew
sodom
and
gomorrah
13
20
it
shall
never
be
inhabited
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
neither
shall
the
arabian
pitch
tent
there
neither
shall
the
shepherds
make
their
fold
there
13
21
but
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
shall
lie
there
and
their
houses
shall
be
full
of
doleful
creatures
and
owls
shall
dwell
there
and
satyrs
shall
dance
there
13
22
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
cry
in
their
desolate
houses
and
dragons
in
their
pleasant
palaces
and
her
time
is
near
to
come
and
her
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
14
1
for
the
lord
will
have
mercy
on
jacob
and
will
yet
choose
israel
and
set
them
in
their
own
land
and
the
strangers
shall
be
joined
with
them
and
they
shall
cleave
to
the
house
of
jacob
14
2
and
the
people
shall
take
them
and
bring
them
to
their
place
and
the
house
of
israel
shall
possess
them
in
the
land
of
the
lord
for
servants
and
handmaids
and
they
shall
take
them
captives
whose
captives
they
were
and
they
shall
rule
over
their
oppressors
14
3
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
day
that
the
lord
shall
give
thee
rest
from
thy
sorrow
and
from
thy
fear
and
from
the
hard
bondage
wherein
thou
wast
made
to
serve
14
4
that
thou
shalt
take
up
this
proverb
against
the
king
of
babylon
and
say
how
hath
the
oppressor
ceased
the
golden
city
ceased
14
5
the
lord
hath
broken
the
staff
of
the
wicked
and
the
sceptre
of
the
rulers
14
6
he
who
smote
the
people
in
wrath
with
a
continual
stroke
he
that
ruled
the
nations
in
anger
is
persecuted
and
none
hindereth
14
7
the
whole
earth
is
at
rest
and
is
quiet
they
break
forth
into
singing
14
8
yea
the
fir
trees
rejoice
at
thee
and
the
cedars
of
lebanon
saying
since
thou
art
laid
down
no
feller
is
come
up
against
us
14
9
hell
from
beneath
is
moved
for
thee
to
meet
thee
at
thy
coming
it
stirreth
up
the
dead
for
thee
even
all
the
chief
ones
of
the
earth
it
hath
raised
up
from
their
thrones
all
the
kings
of
the
nations
14
10
all
they
shall
speak
and
say
unto
thee
art
thou
also
become
weak
as
we
art
thou
become
like
unto
us
14
11
thy
pomp
is
brought
down
to
the
grave
and
the
noise
of
thy
viols
the
worm
is
spread
under
thee
and
the
worms
cover
thee
14
12
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
how
art
thou
cut
down
to
the
ground
which
didst
weaken
the
nations
14
13
for
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart
i
will
ascend
into
heaven
i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
i
will
sit
also
upon
the
mount
of
the
congregation
in
the
sides
of
the
north
14
14
i
will
ascend
above
the
heights
of
the
clouds
i
will
be
like
the
most
high
14
15
yet
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell
to
the
sides
of
the
pit
14
16
they
that
see
thee
shall
narrowly
look
upon
thee
and
consider
thee
saying
is
this
the
man
that
made
the
earth
to
tremble
that
did
shake
kingdoms
14
17
that
made
the
world
as
a
wilderness
and
destroyed
the
cities
thereof
that
opened
not
the
house
of
his
prisoners
14
18
all
the
kings
of
the
nations
even
all
of
them
lie
in
glory
every
one
in
his
own
house
14
19
but
thou
art
cast
out
of
thy
grave
like
an
abominable
branch
and
as
the
raiment
of
those
that
are
slain
thrust
through
with
a
sword
that
go
down
to
the
stones
of
the
pit
as
a
carcase
trodden
under
feet
14
20
thou
shalt
not
be
joined
with
them
in
burial
because
thou
hast
destroyed
thy
land
and
slain
thy
people
the
seed
of
evildoers
shall
never
be
renowned
14
21
prepare
slaughter
for
his
children
for
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
that
they
do
not
rise
nor
possess
the
land
nor
fill
the
face
of
the
world
with
cities
14
22
for
i
will
rise
up
against
them
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
cut
off
from
babylon
the
name
and
remnant
and
son
and
nephew
saith
the
lord
14
23
i
will
also
make
it
a
possession
for
the
bittern
and
pools
of
water
and
i
will
sweep
it
with
the
besom
of
destruction
saith
the
lord
of

14
24
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sworn
saying
surely
as
i
have
thought
so
shall
it
come
to
pass
and
as
i
have
purposed
so
shall
it
stand
14
25
that
i
will
break
the
assyrian
in
my
land
and
upon
my
mountains
tread
him
under
foot
then
shall
his
yoke
depart
from
off
them
and
his
burden
depart
from
off
their
shoulders
14

this
is
the
purpose
that
is
purposed
upon
the
whole
earth
and
this
is
the
hand
that
is
stretched
out
upon
all
the
nations
14
27
for
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
and

shall
disannul
it
and
his
hand
is
stretched
out
and
who
shall
turn
it
back
14
28
in
the
year
that
king
ahaz
died
was
this
burden
14

rejoice
not
thou
whole

because
the
rod
of
him
that

thee
is
broken
for
out

forth
a

kill
thy

thou
whole

what
shall
one
then
answer
the
messengers
of
the

that
the

hath
founded
zion
and
the
poor
of
his
people
shall
trust

the

my

judging

we
have
heard
of
the
pride
of
moab
he
is
very
proud
even
of
his
haughtiness
and
his
pride
and
his
wrath
but
his
lies
shall
not
be
so
16
7
therefore
shall
moab
howl
for
moab
every
one
shall
howl
for
the
foundations
of
kirhareseth
shall
ye
mourn
surely
they
are
stricken
16

for
the
fields
of
heshbon
languish
and
the
vine
of
sibmah
the
lords
of
the
heathen
have
broken
down
the
principal
plants
thereof
they
are
come
even
unto
jazer
they
wandered
through
the
wilderness
her
branches
are
stretched
out
they
are
gone
over
the
sea
16
9
therefore
i
will
bewail
with
the
weeping
of
jazer
the
vine
of
sibmah
i
will
water
thee
with
my
tears
o
heshbon
and
elealeh
for
the
shouting
for
thy
summer
fruits
and
for
thy
harvest
is
fallen
16
10
and
gladness
is
taken
away
and
joy
out
of
the
plentiful
field
and
in
the
vineyards
there
shall
be
no
singing
neither
shall
there
be
shouting
the
treaders
shall
tread
out
no
wine
in
their
presses
i
have
made
their
vintage
shouting
to
cease
16
11
wherefore
my
bowels
shall
sound
like
an
harp
for
moab
and
mine
inward
parts
for
kirharesh
16
12
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
it
is
seen
that
moab
is
weary
on
the
high
place
that
he
shall
come
to
his
sanctuary
to
pray
but
he
shall
not
prevail
16
13
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
moab
since
that
time
16
14
but
now
the
lord
hath
spoken
saying
within
three
years
as
the
years
of
an
hireling
and
the
glory
of
moab
shall
be
contemned
with
all
that
great
multitude
and
the
remnant
shall
be
very
small
and
feeble
17
1
the
burden
of
damascus
behold
damascus
is
taken
away
from
being
a
city
and
it
shall
be
a
ruinous
heap
17
2
the
cities
of
aroer
are
forsaken
they
shall
be
for
flocks
which
shall
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
17
3
the
fortress
also
shall
cease
from
ephraim
and
the
kingdom
from
damascus
and
the
remnant
of
syria
they
shall
be
as
the
glory
of
the
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
17
4
and
in
that
day
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
glory
of
jacob
shall
be
made
thin
and
the
fatness
of
his
flesh
shall
wax
lean
17
5
and
it
shall
be
as
when
the
harvestman
gathereth
the
corn
and
reapeth
the
ears
with
his
arm
and
it
shall
be
as
he
that
gathereth
ears
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
17
6
yet
gleaning
grapes
shall
be
left
in
it
as
the
shaking
of
an
olive
tree
two
or
three
berries
in
the
top
of
the
uppermost
bough
four
or
five
in
the
outmost
fruitful
branches
thereof
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
17
7
at
that
day
shall
a
man
look
to
his
maker
and
his
eyes
shall
have
respect
to
the
holy
one
of
israel
17
8
and
he
shall
not
look
to
the
altars
the
work
of
his
hands
neither
shall
respect
that
which
his
fingers
have
made
either
the
groves
or
the
images
17
9
in
that
day
shall
his
strong
cities
be
as
a
forsaken
bough
and
an
uppermost
branch
which
they
left
because
of
the
children
of
israel
and
there
shall
be
desolation
17
10
because
thou
hast
forgotten
the
god
of
thy
salvation
and
hast
not
been
mindful
of
the
rock
of
thy
strength
therefore
shalt
thou
plant
pleasant
plants
and
shalt
set
it
with
strange
slips
17
11
in
the
day
shalt
thou
make
thy
plant
to
grow
and
in
the
morning
shalt
thou
make
thy
seed
to
flourish
but
the
harvest
shall
be
a
heap
in
the
day
of
grief
and
of
desperate
sorrow
17
12
woe
to
the
multitude
of
many
people
which
make
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
the
seas
and
to
the
rushing
of
nations
that
make
a
rushing
like
the
rushing
of
mighty
waters
17
13
the
nations
shall
rush
like
the
rushing
of
many
waters
but
god
shall
rebuke
them
and
they
shall
flee
far
off
and
shall
be
chased
as
the
chaff
of
the
mountains
before
the
wind
and
like
a
rolling
thing
before
the
whirlwind
17
14
and
behold
at
eveningtide
trouble
and
before
the
morning
he
is
not
this
is
the
portion
of
them
that
spoil
us
and
the
lot
of
them
that
rob
us
18
1
woe
to
the
land
shadowing
with
wings
which
is
beyond
the
rivers
of
ethiopia
18
2
that
sendeth
ambassadors
by
the
sea
even
in
vessels
of
bulrushes
upon
the
waters
saying
go
ye
swift
messengers
to
a
nation
scattered
and
peeled
to
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
down
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled
18

all
ye
inhabitants
of
the
world
and
dwellers
on
the
earth
see
ye
when
he
lifteth
up
an
ensign
on
the
mountains
and
when
he
bloweth
a
trumpet
hear
ye
18
4
for
so
the
lord
said
unto
me
i
will
take
my
rest
and
i
will
consider
in
my
dwelling
place
like
a
clear
heat
upon
herbs
and
like
a
cloud
of
dew
in
the
heat
of
harvest
18
5
for
afore
the
harvest
when
the
bud
is
perfect
and
the
sour
grape
is
ripening
in
the
flower
he
shall
both
cut
off
the
sprigs
with
pruning
hooks
and
take
away
and
cut
down
the
branches
18
6
they
shall
be
left
together
unto
the
fowls
of
the
mountains
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
the
fowls
shall
summer
upon
them
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
earth
shall
winter
upon
them
18
7
in
that
time
shall
the
present
be
brought
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
of
a
people
scattered
and
peeled
and
from
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
under
foot
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled
to
the
place
of
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
mount
zion
19
1
the
burden
of
egypt
behold
the
lord
rideth
upon
a
swift
cloud
and
shall
come
into
egypt
and
the
idols
of
egypt
shall
be
moved
at
his
presence
and
the
heart
of
egypt
shall
melt
in
the
midst
of
it
19
2
and
i
will
set
the
egyptians
against
the
egyptians
and
they
shall
fight
every
one
against
his
brother
and
every
one
against
his
neighbour
city
against
city
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
19
3
and
the
spirit
of
egypt
shall
fail
in
the
midst
thereof
and
i
will
destroy
the
counsel
thereof
and
they
shall
seek
to
the
idols
and
to
the
charmers
and
to
them
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
to
the
wizards
19
4
and
the
egyptians
will
i
give
over
into
the
hand
of
a
cruel
lord
and
a
fierce
king
shall
rule
over
them
saith
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
19
5
and
the
waters
shall
fail
from
the
sea
and
the
river
shall
be
wasted
and
dried
up
19
6
and
they
shall
turn
the
rivers
far
away
and
the
brooks
of
defence
shall
be
emptied
and
dried
up
the
reeds
and
flags
shall
wither
19
7
the
paper
reeds
by
the
brooks
by
the
mouth
of
the
brooks
and
every
thing
sown
by
the
brooks
shall
wither
be
driven
away
and
be
no
more
19
8
the
fishers
also
shall
mourn
and
all
they
that
cast
angle
into
the
brooks
shall
lament
and
they
that
spread
nets
upon
the
waters
shall
languish
19
9
moreover
they
that
work
in
fine
flax
and
they
that
weave
networks
shall
be
confounded
19
10
and
they
shall
be
broken
in
the
purposes
thereof
all
that
make
sluices
and
ponds
for
fish
19
11
surely
the
princes
of
zoan
are
fools
the
counsel
of
the
wise
counsellors
of
pharaoh
is
become
brutish
how
say
ye
unto
pharaoh
i
am
the
son
of
the
wise
the
son
of
ancient
kings
19
12
where
are
they
where
are
thy
wise
men
and
let
them
tell
thee
now
and
let
them
know
what
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
upon
egypt
19
13
the
princes
of
zoan
are
become
fools
the
princes
of
noph
are
deceived
they
have
also
seduced
egypt
even
they
that
are
the
stay
of
the
tribes
thereof
19
14
the
lord
hath
mingled
a
perverse
spirit
in
the
midst
thereof
and
they
have
caused
egypt
to
err
in
every
work
thereof
as
a
drunken
man
staggereth
in
his
vomit
19
15
neither
shall
there
be
any
work
for
egypt
which
the
head
or
tail
branch
or
rush
may
do
19
16
in
that
day
shall
egypt
be
like
unto
women
and
it
shall
be
afraid
and
fear
because
of
the
shaking
of
the
hand
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
he
shaketh
over
it
19
17
and
the
land
of
judah
shall
be
a
terror
unto
egypt
every
one
that
maketh
mention
thereof
shall
be
afraid
in
himself
because
of
the
counsel
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
he
hath
determined
against
it
19
18
in
that
day
shall
five
cities
in
the
land
of
egypt
speak
the
language
of
canaan
and
swear
to
the
lord
of
hosts
one
shall
be
called
the
city
of
destruction
19
19
in
that
day
shall
there
be
an
altar
to
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
a
pillar
at
the
border
thereof
to
the
lord
19
20
and
it
shall
be
for
a
sign
and
for
a
witness
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
in
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
shall
cry
unto
the
lord
because
of
the
oppressors
and
he
shall
send
them
a
saviour
and
a
great
one
and
he
shall
deliver
them
19
21
and
the
lord
shall
be
known
to
egypt
and
the
egyptians
shall
know
the
lord
in
that
day
and
shall
do
sacrifice
and
oblation
yea
they
shall
vow
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
perform
it
19
22
and
the
lord
shall
smite
egypt
he
shall
smite
and
heal
it
and
they
shall
return
even
to
the
lord
and
he
shall
be
intreated
of
them
and
shall
heal
them
19
23
in
that
day
shall
there
be
a
highway
out
of
egypt
to
assyria
and
the
assyrian
shall
come
into
egypt
and
the
egyptian
into
assyria
and
the
egyptians
shall
serve
with
the
assyrians
19
24
in
that
day
shall
israel
be
the
third
with
egypt
and
with
assyria
even
a
blessing
in
the
midst
of
the
land
19
25
whom
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
bless
saying
blessed
be
egypt
my
people
and
assyria
the
work
of
my
hands
and
israel
mine
inheritance
20
1
in
the
year
that
tartan
came
unto
ashdod
(when
sargon
the
king
of
assyria
sent
him
)
and
fought
against
ashdod
and
took
it
20
2
at
the
same
time
spake
the
lord
by
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
saying
go
and
loose
the
sackcloth
from
off
thy
loins
and
put
off
thy
shoe
from
thy
foot
and
he
did
so
walking
naked
and
barefoot
20
3
and
the
lord
said
like
as
my
servant
isaiah
hath
walked
naked
and
barefoot
three
years
for
a
sign
and
wonder
upon
egypt
and
upon
ethiopia
20
4
so
shall
the
king
of
assyria
lead
away
the
egyptians
prisoners
and
the
ethiopians
captives
young
and
old
naked
and
barefoot
even
with
their
buttocks
uncovered
to
the
shame
of
egypt
20
5
and
they
shall
be
afraid
and
ashamed
of
ethiopia
their
expectation
and
of
egypt
their
glory
20
6
and
the
inhabitant
of
this
isle
shall
say
in
that
day
behold
such
is
our
expectation
whither
we
flee
for
help
to
be
delivered
from
the
king
of
assyria
and
how
shall
we
escape
21
1
the
burden
of
the
desert
of
the
sea
as
whirlwinds
in
the
south
pass
through
so
it
cometh
from
the
desert
from
a
terrible
land
21
2
a
grievous
vision
is
declared
unto
me
the
treacherous
dealer
dealeth
treacherously
and
the
spoiler
spoileth
go
up
o
elam
besiege
o
media
all
the
sighing
thereof
have
i
made
to
cease
21
3
therefore
are
my
loins
filled
with
pain
pangs
have
taken
hold
upon
me
as
the
pangs
of
a
woman
that
travaileth
i
was
bowed
down
at
the
hearing
of
it
i
was
dismayed
at
the
seeing
of
it
21
4
my
heart
panted
fearfulness
affrighted
me
the
night
of
my
pleasure
hath
he
turned
into
fear
unto
me
21
5
prepare
the
table
watch
in
the
watchtower
eat
drink
arise
ye
princes
and
anoint
the
shield
21
6
for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
set
a
watchman
let
him
declare
what
he
seeth
21
7
and
he
saw
a
chariot
with
a
couple
of
horsemen
a
chariot
of
asses
and
a
chariot
of
camels
and
he
hearkened
diligently
with
much
heed
21
8
and
he
cried
a
lion
my
lord
i
stand
continually
upon
the
watchtower
in
the
daytime
and
i
am
set
in
my
ward
whole
nights
21
9
and
behold
here
cometh
a
chariot
of
men
with
a
couple
of
horsemen
and
he
answered
and
said
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
and
all
the
graven
images
of
her
gods
he
hath
broken
unto
the
ground
21
10
o
my
threshing
and
the
corn
of
my
floor
that
which
i
have
heard
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
have
i
declared
unto
you
21
11
the
burden
of
dumah
he
calleth
to
me
out
of
seir
watchman
what
of
the
night
watchman
what
of
the
night
21
12
the
watchman
said
the
morning
cometh
and
also
the
night
if
ye
will
enquire
enquire
ye
return
come
21
13
the
burden
upon
arabia
in
the
forest
in
arabia
shall
ye
lodge
o
ye
travelling
companies
of
dedanim
21
14
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
tema
brought
water
to
him
that
was
thirsty
they
prevented
with
their
bread
him
that
fled
21
15
for
they
fled
from
the
swords
from
the
drawn
sword
and
from
the
bent
bow
and
from
the
grievousness
of
war
21
16
for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
unto
me
within
a
year
according
to
the
years
of
an
hireling
and
all
the
glory
of
kedar
shall
fail
21
17
and
the
residue
of
the
number
of
archers
the
mighty
men
of
the
children
of
kedar
shall
be
diminished
for
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
spoken
it
22
1
the
burden
of
the
valley
of
vision
what
aileth
thee
now
that
thou
art
wholly
gone
up
to
the
housetops
22
2
thou
that
art
full
of
stirs
a
tumultuous
city
joyous
city
thy
slain
men
are
not
slain
with
the
sword
nor
dead
in
battle
22
3
all
thy
rulers
are
fled
together
they
are
bound
by
the
archers
all
that
are
found
in
thee
are
bound
together
which
have
fled
from
far
22
4
therefore
said
i
look
away
from
me
i
will
weep
bitterly
labour
not
to
comfort
me
because
of
the
spoiling
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
22
5
for
it
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
treading
down
and
of
perplexity
by
the
lord
god
of
hosts
in
the
valley
of
vision
breaking
down
the
walls
and
of
crying
to
the
mountains
22
6
and
elam
bare
the
quiver
with
chariots
of
men
and
horsemen
and
kir
uncovered
the
shield
22
7
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
thy
choicest
valleys
shall
be
full
of
chariots
and
the
horsemen
shall
set
themselves
in
array
at
the
gate
22
8
and
he
discovered
the
covering
of
judah
and
thou
didst
look
in
that
day
to
the
armour
of
the
house
of
the
forest
22
9
ye
have
seen
also
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
david
that
they
are
many
and
ye
gathered
together
the
waters
of
the
lower
pool
22
10
and
ye
have
numbered
the
houses
of
jerusalem
and
the
houses
have
ye
broken
down
to
fortify
the
wall
22
11
ye
made
also
a
ditch
between
the
two
walls
for
the
water
of
the
old
pool
but
ye
have
not
looked
unto
the
maker
thereof
neither
had
respect
unto
him
that
fashioned
it
long
ago
22
12
and
in
that
day
did
the
lord
god
of
hosts
call
to
weeping
and
to
mourning
and
to
baldness
and
to
girding
with
sackcloth
22
13
and
behold
joy
and
gladness
slaying
oxen
and
killing
sheep
eating
flesh
and
drinking
wine
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
to
morrow
we
shall
die
22
14
and
it
was
revealed
in
mine
ears
by
the
lord
of
hosts
surely
this
iniquity
shall
not
be
purged
from
you
till
ye
die
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
22
15
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
go
get
thee
unto
this
treasurer
even
unto
shebna
which
is
over
the
house
and
say
22
16
what
hast
thou
here
and
whom
hast
thou
here
that
thou
hast
hewed
thee
out
a
sepulchre
here
as
he
that
heweth
him
out
a
sepulchre
on
high
and
that
graveth
an
habitation
for
himself
in
a
rock
22
17
behold
the
lord
will
carry
thee
away
with
a
mighty
captivity
and
will
surely
cover
thee
22
18
he
will
surely
violently
turn
and
toss
thee
like
a
ball
into
a
large
country
there
shalt
thou
die
and
there
the
chariots
of
thy
glory
shall
be
the
shame
of
thy
lord’s
house
22
19
and
i
will
drive
thee
from
thy
station
and
from
thy
state
shall
he
pull
thee
down
22
20
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
i
will
call
my
servant
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
22
21
and
i
will
clothe
him
with
thy
robe
and
strengthen
him
with
thy
girdle
and
i
will
commit
thy
government
into
his
hand
and
he
shall
be
a
father
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
to
the
house
of
judah
22
22
and
the
key
of
the
house
of
david
will
i
lay
upon
his
shoulder
so
he
shall
open
and
none
shall
shut
and
he
shall
shut
and
none
shall
open
22
23
and
i
will
fasten
him
as
a
nail
in
a
sure
place
and
he
shall
be
for
a
glorious
throne
to
his
father’s
house
22
24
and
they
shall
hang
upon
him
all
the
glory
of
his
father’s
house
the
offspring
and
the
issue
all
vessels
of
small
quantity
from
the
vessels
of
cups
even
to
all
the
vessels
of
flagons
22
25
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
the
nail
that
is
fastened
in
the
sure
place
be
removed
and
be
cut
down
and
fall
and
the
burden
that
was
upon
it
shall
be
cut
off
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
23
1
the
burden
of
tyre
howl
ye
ships
of
tarshish
for
it
is
laid
waste
so
that
there
is
no
house
no
entering
in
from
the
land
of
chittim
it
is
revealed
to
them
23
2
be
still
ye
inhabitants
of
the
isle
thou
whom
the
merchants
of
zidon
that
pass
over
the
sea
have
replenished
23
3
and
by
great
waters
the
seed
of
sihor
the
harvest
of
the
river
is
her
revenue
and
she
is
a
mart
of
nations
23
4
be
thou
ashamed
o
zidon
for
the
sea
hath
spoken
even
the
strength
of
the
sea
saying
i
travail
not
nor
bring
forth
children
neither
do
i
nourish
up
young
men
nor
bring
up
virgins
23
5
as
at
the
report
concerning
egypt
so
shall
they
be
sorely
pained
at
the
report
of
tyre
23
6
pass
ye
over
to
tarshish
howl
ye
inhabitants
of
the
isle
23
7
is
this
your
joyous
city
whose
antiquity
is
of
ancient
days
her
own
feet
shall
carry
her
afar
off
to
sojourn
23
8
who
hath
taken
this
counsel
against
tyre
the
crowning
city
whose
merchants
are
princes
whose
traffickers
are
the
honourable
of
the
earth
23
9
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
it
to
stain
the
pride
of
all
glory
and
to
bring
into
contempt
all
the
honourable
of
the
earth
23
10
pass
through
thy
land
as
a
river
o
daughter
of
tarshish
there
is
no
more
strength
23
11
he
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea
he
shook
the
kingdoms
the
lord
hath
given
a
commandment
against
the
merchant
city
to
destroy
the
strong
holds
thereof
23
12
and
he
said
thou
shalt
no
more
rejoice
o
thou
oppressed
virgin
daughter
of
zidon
arise
pass
over
to
chittim
there
also
shalt
thou
have
no
rest
23
13
behold
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
this
people
was
not
till
the
assyrian
founded
it
for
them
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness
they
set
up
the
towers
thereof
they
raised
up
the
palaces
thereof
and
he
brought
it
to
ruin
23
14
howl
ye
ships
of
tarshish
for
your
strength
is
laid
waste
23
15
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
tyre
shall
be
forgotten
seventy
years
according
to
the
days
of
one
king
after
the
end
of
seventy
years
shall
tyre
sing
as
an
harlot
23
16
take
an
harp
go
about
the
city
thou
harlot
that
hast
been
forgotten
make
sweet
melody
sing
many
songs
that
thou
mayest
be
remembered
23
17
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
after
the
end
of
seventy
years
that
the
lord
will
visit
tyre
and
she
shall
turn
to
her
hire
and
shall
commit
fornication
with
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
23
18
and
her
merchandise
and
her
hire
shall
be
holiness
to
the
lord
it
shall
not
be
treasured
nor
laid
up
for
her
merchandise
shall
be
for
them
that
dwell
before
the
lord
to
eat
sufficiently
and
for
durable
clothing
24
1
behold
the
lord
maketh
the
earth
empty
and
maketh
it
waste
and
turneth
it
upside
down
and
scattereth
abroad
the
inhabitants
thereof
24
2
and
it
shall
be
as
with
the
people
so
with
the
priest
as
with
the
servant
so
with
his
master
as
with
the
maid
so
with
her
mistress
as
with
the
buyer
so
with
the
seller
as
with
the
lender
so
with
the
borrower
as
with
the
taker
of
usury
so
with
the
giver
of
usury
to
him
24
3
the
land
shall
be
utterly
emptied
and
utterly
spoiled
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
this
word
24
4
the
earth
mourneth
and
fadeth
away
the
world
languisheth
and
fadeth
away
the
haughty
people
of
the
earth
do
languish
24
5
the
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws
changed
the
ordinance
broken
the
everlasting
covenant
24
6
therefore
hath
the
curse
devoured
the
earth
and
they
that
dwell
therein
are
desolate
therefore
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
burned
and
few
men
left
24
7
the
new
wine
mourneth
the
vine
languisheth
all
the
merryhearted
do
sigh
24
8
the
mirth
of
tabrets
ceaseth
the
noise
of
them
that
rejoice
endeth
the
joy
of
the
harp
ceaseth
24
9
they
shall
not
drink
wine
with
a
song
strong
drink
shall
be
bitter
to
them
that
drink
it
24
10
the
city
of
confusion
is
broken
down
every
house
is
shut
up
that
no
man
may
come
in
24
11
there
is
a
crying
for
wine
in
the
streets
all
joy
is
darkened
the
mirth
of
the
land
is
gone
24
12
in
the
city
is
left
desolation
and
the
gate
is
smitten
with
destruction
24
13
when
thus
it
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
land
among
the
people
there
shall
be
as
the
shaking
of
an
olive
tree
and
as
the
gleaning
grapes
when
the
vintage
is
done
24
14
they
shall
lift
up
their
voice
they
shall
sing
for
the
majesty
of
the
lord
they
shall
cry
aloud
from
the
sea
24
15
wherefore
glorify
ye
the
lord
in
the
fires
even
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
in
the
isles
of
the
sea
24
16
from
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
have
we
heard
songs
even
glory
to
the
righteous
but
i
said
my
leanness
my
leanness
woe
unto
me
the
treacherous
dealers
have
dealt
treacherously
yea
the
treacherous
dealers
have
dealt
very
treacherously
24
17
fear
and
the
pit
and
the
snare
are
upon
thee
o
inhabitant
of
the
earth
24
18
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
he
who
fleeth
from
the
noise
of
the
fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit
and
he
that
cometh
up
out
of
the
midst
of
the
pit
shall
be
taken
in
the
snare
for
the
windows
from
on
high
are
open
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
do
shake
24
19
the
earth
is
utterly
broken
down
the
earth
is
clean
dissolved
the
earth
is
moved
exceedingly
24
20
the
earth
shall
reel
to
and
fro
like
a
drunkard
and
shall
be
removed
like
a
cottage
and
the
transgression
thereof
shall
be
heavy
upon
it
and
it
shall
fall
and
not
rise
again
24
21
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
punish
the
host
of
the
high
ones
that
are
on
high
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
upon
the
earth
24
22
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
as
prisoners
are
gathered
in
the
pit
and
shall
be
shut
up
in
the
prison
and
after
many
days
shall
they
be
visited
24
23
then
the
moon
shall
be
confounded
and
the
sun
ashamed
when
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
reign
in
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
and
before
his
ancients
gloriously
25
1
o
lord
thou
art
my
god
i
will
exalt
thee
i
will
praise
thy
name
for
thou
hast
done
wonderful
things
thy
counsels
of
old
are
faithfulness
and
truth
25
2
for
thou
hast
made
of
a
city
an
heap
of
a
defenced
city
a
ruin
a
palace
of
strangers
to
be
no
city
it
shall
never
be
built
25
3
therefore
shall
the
strong
people
glorify
thee
the
city
of
the
terrible
nations
shall
fear
thee
25
4
for
thou
hast
been
a
strength
to
the
poor
a
strength
to
the
needy
in
his
distress
a
refuge
from
the
storm
a
shadow
from
the
heat
when
the
blast
of
the
terrible
ones
is
as
a
storm
against
the
wall
25
5
thou
shalt
bring
down
the
noise
of
strangers
as
the
heat
in
a
dry
place
even
the
heat
with
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
the
branch
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
brought
low
25
6
and
in
this
mountain
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
make
unto
all
people
a
feast
of
fat
things
a
feast
of
wines
on
the
lees
of
fat
things
full
of
marrow
of
wines
on
the
lees
well
refined
25
7
and
he
will
destroy
in
this
mountain
the
face
of
the
covering
cast
over
all
people
and
the
vail
that
is
spread
over
all
nations
25
8
he
will
swallow
up
death
in
victory
and
the
lord
god
will
wipe
away
tears
from
off
all
faces
and
the
rebuke
of
his
people
shall
he
take
away
from
off
all
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
25
9
and
it
shall
be
said
in
that
day
lo
this
is
our
god
we
have
waited
for
him
and
he
will
save
us
this
is
the
lord
we
have
waited
for
him
we
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
his
salvation
25
10
for
in
this
mountain
shall
the
hand
of
the
lord
rest
and
moab
shall
be
trodden
down
under
him
even
as
straw
is
trodden
down
for
the
dunghill
25
11
and
he
shall
spread
forth
his
hands
in
the
midst
of
them
as
he
that
swimmeth
spreadeth
forth
his
hands
to
swim
and
he
shall
bring
down
their
pride
together
with
the
spoils
of
their
hands
25
12
and
the
fortress
of
the
high
fort
of
thy
walls
shall
he
bring
down
lay
low
and
bring
to
the
ground
even
to
the
dust
26
1
in
that
day
shall
this
song
be
sung
in
the
land
of
judah
we
have
a
strong
city
salvation
will
god
appoint
for
walls
and
bulwarks
26
2
open
ye
the
gates
that
the
righteous
nation
which
keepeth
the
truth
may
enter
in
26
3
thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee
because
he
trusteth
in
thee
26
4
trust
ye
in
the
lord
for
ever
for
in
the
lord
jehovah
is
everlasting
strength
26
5
for
he
bringeth
down
them
that
dwell
on
high
the
lofty
city
he
layeth
it
low
he
layeth
it
low
even
to
the
ground
he
bringeth
it
even
to
the
dust
26
6
the
foot
shall
tread
it
down
even
the
feet
of
the
poor
and
the
steps
of
the
needy
26
7
the
way
of
the
just
is
uprightness
thou
most
upright
dost
weigh
the
path
of
the
just
26
8
yea
in
the
way
of
thy
judgments
o
lord
have
we
waited
for
thee
the
desire
of
our
soul
is
to
thy
name
and
to
the
remembrance
of
thee
26
9
with
my
soul
have
i
desired
thee
in
the
night
yea
with
my
spirit
within
me
will
i
seek
thee
early
for
when
thy
judgments
are
in
the
earth
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
will
learn
righteousness
26
10
let
favour
be
shewed
to
the
wicked
yet
will
he
not
learn
righteousness
in
the
land
of
uprightness
will
he
deal
unjustly
and
will
not
behold
the
majesty
of
the
lord
26
11
lord
when
thy
hand
is
lifted
up
they
will
not
see
but
they
shall
see
and
be
ashamed
for
their
envy
at
the
people
yea
the
fire
of
thine
enemies
shall
devour
them
26
12
lord
thou
wilt
ordain
peace
for
us
for
thou
also
hast
wrought
all
our
works
in
us
26
13
o
lord
our
god
other
lords
beside
thee
have
had
dominion
over
us
but
by
thee
only
will
we
make
mention
of
thy
name
26
14
they
are
dead
they
shall
not
live
they
are
deceased
they
shall
not
rise
therefore
hast
thou
visited
and
destroyed
them
and
made
all
their
memory
to
perish
26
15
thou
hast
increased
the
nation
o
lord
thou
hast
increased
the
nation
thou
art
glorified
thou
hadst
removed
it
far
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
26
16
lord
in
trouble
have
they
visited
thee
they
poured
out
a
prayer
when
thy
chastening
was
upon
them
26
17
like
as
a
woman
with
child
that
draweth
near
the
time
of
her
delivery
is
in
pain
and
crieth
out
in
her
pangs
so
have
we
been
in
thy
sight
o
lord
26
18
we
have
been
with
child
we
have
been
in
pain
we
have
as
it
were
brought
forth
wind
we
have
not
wrought
any
deliverance
in
the
earth
neither
have
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
fallen
26
19
thy
dead
men
shall
live
together
with
my
dead
body
shall
they
arise
awake
and
sing
ye
that
dwell
in
dust
for
thy
dew
is
as
the
dew
of
herbs
and
the
earth
shall
cast
out
the
dead
26
20
come
my
people
enter
thou
into
thy
chambers
and
shut
thy
doors
about
thee
hide
thyself
as
it
were
for
a
little
moment
until
the
indignation
be
overpast
26
21
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
out
of
his
place
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
their
iniquity
the
earth
also
shall
disclose
her
blood
and
shall
no
more
cover
her
slain
27
1
in
that
day
the
lord
with
his
sore
and
great
and
strong
sword
shall
punish
leviathan
the
piercing
serpent
even
leviathan
that
crooked
serpent
and
he
shall
slay
the
dragon
that
is
in
the
sea
27
2
in
that
day
sing
ye
unto
her
a
vineyard
of
red
wine
27
3
i
the
lord
do
keep
it
i
will
water
it
every
moment
lest
any
hurt
it
i
will
keep
it
night
and
day
27

fury
is
not
in
me
who
would
set
the
briers
and
thorns
against
me
in
battle
i
would
go
through
them
i
would
burn
them
together
27
5
or
let
him
take
hold
of
my
strength
that
he
may
make
peace
with
me
and
he
shall
make
peace
with
me
27
6
he
shall
cause
them
that
come
of
jacob
to
take
root
israel
shall
blossom
and
bud
and
fill
the
face
of
the
world
with
fruit
27
7
hath
he
smitten
him
as
he
smote
those
that
smote
him
or
is
he
slain
according
to
the
slaughter
of
them
that
are
slain
by
him
27
8
in
measure
when
it
shooteth
forth
thou
wilt
debate
with
it
he
stayeth
his
rough
wind
in
the
day
of
the
east
wind
27
9
by
this
therefore
shall
the
iniquity
of
jacob
be
purged
and
this
is
all
the
fruit
to
take
away
his
sin
when
he
maketh
all
the
stones
of
the
altar
as
chalkstones
that
are
beaten
in
sunder
the
groves
and
images
shall
not
stand
up
27
10
yet
the
defenced
city
shall
be
desolate
and
the
habitation
forsaken
and
left
like
a
wilderness
there
shall
the
calf
feed
and
there
shall
he
lie
down
and
consume
the
branches
thereof
27
11
when
the
boughs
thereof
are
withered
they
shall
be
broken
off
the
women
come
and
set
them
on
fire
for
it
is
a
people
of
no
understanding
therefore
he
that
made
them
will
not
have
mercy
on
them
and
he
that
formed
them
will
shew
them
no
favour
27
12
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
beat
off
from
the
channel
of
the
river
unto
the
stream
of
egypt
and
ye
shall
be
gathered
one
by
one
o
ye
children
of
israel
27
13
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
great
trumpet
shall
be
blown
and
they
shall
come
which
were
ready
to
perish
in
the
land
of
assyria
and
the
outcasts
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
shall
worship
the
lord
in
the
holy
mount
at
jerusalem
28
1
woe
to
the
crown
of
pride
to
the
drunkards
of
ephraim
whose
glorious
beauty
is
a
fading
flower
which
are
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valleys
of
them
that
are
overcome
with
wine
28
2
behold
the
lord
hath
a
mighty
and
strong
one
which
as
a
tempest
of
hail
and
a
destroying
storm
as
a
flood
of
mighty
waters
overflowing
shall
cast
down
to
the
earth
with
the
hand
28
3
the
crown
of
pride
the
drunkards
of
ephraim
shall
be
trodden
under
feet
28
4
and
the
glorious
beauty
which
is
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valley
shall
be
a
fading
flower
and
as
the
hasty
fruit
before
the
summer
which
when
he
that
looketh
upon
it
seeth
while
it
is
yet
in
his
hand
he
eateth
it
up
28
5
in
that
day
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
be
for
a
crown
of
glory
and
for
a
diadem
of
beauty
unto
the
residue
of
his
people
28
6
and
for
a
spirit
of
judgment
to
him
that
sitteth
in
judgment
and
for
strength
to
them
that
turn
the
battle
to
the
gate
28
7
but
they
also
have
erred
through
wine
and
through
strong
drink
are
out
of
the
way
the
priest
and
the
prophet
have
erred
through
strong
drink
they
are
swallowed
up
of
wine
they
are
out
of
the
way
through
strong
drink
they
err
in
vision
they
stumble
in
judgment
28
8
for
all
tables
are
full
of
vomit
and
filthiness
so
that
there
is
no
place
clean
28
9
whom
shall
he
teach
knowledge
and
whom
shall
he
make
to
understand
doctrine
them
that
are
weaned
from
the
milk
and
drawn
from
the
breasts
28
10
for
precept
must
be
upon
precept
precept
upon

line
upon

line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
28
11
for
with
stammering
lips
and
another
tongue
will
he
speak
to
this
people
28
12
to
whom
he
said
this
is
the
rest
wherewith
ye
may
cause
the
weary
to
rest
and
this
is
the
refreshing
yet
they
would
not
hear
28
13
but
the
word
of
the
lord
was
unto
them
precept
upon
precept
precept
upon
precept
line
upon
line
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
that
they
might
go
and
fall
backward
and
be
broken
and
snared
and
taken
28
14
wherefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
scornful
men
that
rule
this
people
which
is
in
jerusalem
28
15
because
ye
have
said
we
have
made
a
covenant
with
death
and
with
hell
are
we
at
agreement
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through
it
shall
not
come
unto
us
for
we
have
made
lies
our
refuge
and
under
falsehood
have
we
hid
ourselves
28
16
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
lay
in
zion
for
a
foundation
a
stone
a
tried
stone
a
precious
corner
stone
a
sure
foundation
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste
28
17
judgment
also
will
i
lay
to
the
line
and
righteousness
to
the
plummet
and
the
hail
shall
sweep
away
the
refuge
of
lies
and
the
waters
shall
overflow
the
hiding
place
28
18
and
your
covenant
with
death
shall
be
disannulled
and
your
agreement
with
hell
shall
not
stand
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through
then
ye
shall
be
trodden
down
by
it
28
19
from
the
time
that
it
goeth
forth
it
shall
take
you
for
morning
by
morning
shall
it
pass
over
by
day
and
by
night
and
it
shall
be
a
vexation
only
to
understand
the
report
28
20
for
the
bed
is
shorter
than
that
a
man
can
stretch
himself
on
it
and
the
covering
narrower
than
that
he
can
wrap
himself
in
it
28
21
for
the
lord
shall
rise
up
as
in
mount
perazim
he
shall
be
wroth
as
in
the
valley
of
gibeon
that
he
may
do
his
work
his
strange
work
and
bring
to
pass
his
act
his
strange
act
28
22
now
therefore
be
ye
not
mockers
lest
your
bands
be
made
strong
for
i
have
heard
from
the
lord
god
of
hosts
a
consumption
even
determined
upon
the
whole
earth
28
23
give
ye
ear
and
hear
my
voice
hearken
and
hear
my
speech
28
24
doth
the
plowman
plow
all
day
to
sow
doth
he
open
and
break
the
clods
of
his
ground
28
25
when
he
hath
made
plain
the
face
thereof
doth
he
not
cast
abroad
the
fitches
and
scatter
the
cummin
and
cast
in
the
principal
wheat
and
the
appointed
barley
and
the
rie
in
their
place
28
26
for
his
god
doth
instruct
him
to
discretion
and
doth
teach
him
28
27
for
the
fitches
are
not
threshed
with
a
threshing
instrument
neither
is
a
cart
wheel
turned
about
upon
the
cummin
but
the
fitches
are
beaten
out
with
a
staff
and
the
cummin
with
a
rod
28
28
bread
corn
is
bruised
because
he
will
not
ever
be
threshing
it
nor
break
it
with
the
wheel
of
his
cart
nor
bruise
it
with
his
horsemen
28
29
this
also
cometh
forth
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
is
wonderful
in
counsel
and
excellent
in
working
29
1
woe
to
ariel
to
ariel
the
city
where
david
dwelt
add
ye
year
to
year
let
them
kill
sacrifices
29
2
yet
i
will
distress
ariel
and
there
shall
be
heaviness
and
sorrow
and
it
shall
be
unto
me
as
ariel
29
3
and
i
will
camp
against
thee
round
about
and
will
lay
siege
against
thee
with
a
mount
and
i
will
raise
forts
against
thee
29
4
and
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
and
shalt
speak
out
of
the
ground
and
thy
speech
shall
be
low
out
of
the
dust
and
thy
voice
shall
be
as
of
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
out
of
the
ground
and
thy
speech
shall
whisper
out
of
the
dust
29
5
moreover
the
multitude
of
thy
strangers
shall
be
like
small
dust
and
the
multitude
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
away
yea
it
shall
be
at
an
instant
suddenly
29
6
thou
shalt
be
visited
of
the
lord
of
hosts
with
thunder
and
with
earthquake
and
great
noise
with
storm
and
tempest
and
the
flame
of
devouring
fire
29
7
and
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
that
fight
against
ariel
even
all
that
fight
against
her
and
her
munition
and
that
distress
her
shall
be
as
a
dream
of
a
night
vision
29
8
it
shall
even
be
as
when
an
hungry
man
dreameth
and
behold
he
eateth
but
he
awaketh
and
his
soul
is
empty
or
as
when
a
thirsty
man
dreameth
and
behold
he
drinketh
but
he
awaketh
and
behold
he
is
faint
and
his
soul
hath
appetite
so
shall
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
be
that
fight
against
mount
zion
29
9
stay
yourselves
and
wonder
cry
ye
out
and
cry
they
are
drunken
but
not
with
wine
they
stagger
but
not
with
strong
drink
29
10
for
the
lord
hath
poured
out
upon
you
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep
and
hath
closed
your
eyes
the
prophets
and
your
rulers
the
seers
hath
he
covered
29
11
and
the
vision
of
all
is
become
unto
you
as
the
words
of
a
book
that
is
sealed
which
men
deliver
to
one
that
is
learned
saying
read
this
i
pray
thee
and
he
saith
i
cannot
for
it
is
sealed
29
12
and
the
book
is
delivered
to
him
that
is
not
learned
saying
read
this
i
pray
thee
and
he
saith
i
am
not
learned
29
13
wherefore
the
lord
said
forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
me
with
their
mouth
and
with
their
lips
do
honour
me
but
have
removed
their
heart
far
from
me
and
their
fear
toward
me
is
taught
by
the
precept
of
men
29
14
therefore
behold
i
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvellous
work
among
this
people
even
a
marvellous
work
and
a
wonder
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
men
shall
perish
and
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
men
shall
be
hid
29
15
woe
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
lord
and
their
works
are
in
the
dark
and
they
say
who
seeth
us
and
who
knoweth
us
29
16
surely
your
turning
of
things
upside
down
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
potter’s
clay
for
shall
the
work
say
of
him
that
made
it
he
made
me
not
or
shall
the
thing
framed
say
of
him
that
framed
it
he
had
no
understanding
29
17
is
it
not
yet
a
very
little
while
and
lebanon
shall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
be
esteemed
as
a
forest
29
18
and
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
the
words
of
the
book
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness
29
19
the
meek
also
shall
increase
their
joy
in
the
lord
and
the
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
29
20
for
the
terrible
one
is
brought
to
nought
and
the
scorner
is
consumed
and
all
that
watch
for
iniquity
are
cut
off
29
21
that
make
a
man
an
offender
for
a
word
and
lay
a
snare
for
him
that
reproveth
in
the
gate
and
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thing
of
nought
29
22
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
who
redeemed
abraham
concerning
the
house
of
jacob
jacob
shall
not
now
be
ashamed
neither
shall
his
face
now
wax
pale
29
23
but
when
he
seeth
his
children
the
work
of
mine
hands
in
the
midst
of
him
they
shall
sanctify
my
name
and
sanctify
the
holy
one
of
jacob
and
shall
fear
the
god
of
israel
29
24
they
also
that
erred
in
spirit
shall
come
to
understanding
and
they
that
murmured
shall
learn
doctrine
30
1
woe
to
the
rebellious
children
saith
the
lord
that
take
counsel
but
not
of
me
and
that
cover
with
a
covering
but
not
of
my
spirit
that
they
may
add
sin
to
sin
30
2
that
walk
to
go
down
into
egypt
and
have
not
asked
at
my
mouth
to
strengthen
themselves
in
the
strength
of
pharaoh
and
to
trust
in
the
shadow
of
egypt
30
3
therefore
shall
the
strength
of
pharaoh
be
your
shame
and
the
trust
in
the
shadow
of
egypt
your
confusion
30
4
for
his
princes
were
at
zoan
and
his
ambassadors
came
to
hanes
30
5
they
were
all
ashamed
of
a
people
that
could
not
profit
them
nor
be
an
help
nor
profit
but
a
shame
and
also
a
reproach
30
6
the
burden
of
the
beasts
of
the
south
into
the
land
of
trouble
and
anguish
from
whence
come
the
young
and
old
lion
the
viper
and
fiery
flying
serpent
they
will
carry
their
riches
upon
the
shoulders
of
young
asses
and
their
treasures
upon
the
bunches
of
camels
to
a
people
that
shall
not
profit
them
30
7
for
the
egyptians
shall
help
in
vain
and
to
no
purpose
therefore
have
i
cried
concerning
this
their
strength
is
to
sit
still
30
8
now
go
write
it
before
them
in
a
table
and
note
it
in
a
book
that
it
may
be
for
the
time
to
come
for
ever
and
ever
30
9
that
this
is
a
rebellious
people
lying
children
children
that
will
not
hear
the
law
of
the
lord
30
10
which
say
to
the
seers
see
not
and
to
the
prophets
prophesy
not
unto
us
right
things
speak
unto
us
smooth
things
prophesy
deceits
30
11
get
you
out
of
the
way
turn
aside
out
of
the
path
cause
the
holy
one
of
israel
to
cease
from
before
us
30
12
wherefore
thus
saith
the
holy
one
of
israel
because
ye
despise
this
word
and
trust
in
oppression
and
perverseness
and
stay
thereon
30
13
therefore
this
iniquity
shall
be
to
you
as
a
breach
ready
to
fall
swelling
out
in
a
high
wall
whose
breaking
cometh
suddenly
at
an
instant
30
14
and
he
shall
break
it
as
the
breaking
of
the
potters’
vessel
that
is
broken
in
pieces
he
shall
not
spare
so
that
there
shall
not
be
found
in
the
bursting
of
it
a
sherd
to
take
fire
from
the
hearth
or
to
take
water
withal
out
of
the
pit
30
15
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
returning
and
rest
shall
ye
be
saved
in
quietness
and
in
confidence
shall
be
your
strength
and
ye
would
not
30
16
but
ye
said
no
for
we
will
flee
upon
horses
therefore
shall
ye
flee
and
we
will
ride
upon
the
swift
therefore
shall
they
that
pursue
you
be
swift
30
17
one
thousand
shall
flee
at
the
rebuke
of
one
at
the
rebuke
of
five
shall
ye
flee
till
ye
be
left
as
a
beacon
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
as
an
ensign
on
an
hill
30
18
and
therefore
will
the
lord
wait
that
he
may
be
gracious
unto
you
and
therefore
will
he
be
exalted
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
you
for
the
lord
is
a
god
of
judgment
blessed
are
all
they
that
wait
for
him
30
19
for
the
people
shall
dwell
in
zion
at
jerusalem
thou
shalt
weep
no
more
he
will
be
very
gracious
unto
thee
at
the
voice
of
thy
cry
when
he
shall
hear
it
he
will
answer
thee
30
20
and
though
the
lord
give
you
the
bread
of
adversity
and
the
water
of
affliction
yet
shall
not
thy
teachers
be
removed
into
a
corner
any
more
but
thine
eyes
shall
see
thy
teachers
30
21
and
thine
ears
shall
hear
a
word
behind
thee
saying
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
when
ye
turn
to
the
right
hand
and
when
ye
turn
to
the
left
30
22
ye
shall
defile
also
the
covering
of
thy
graven
images
of
silver
and
the
ornament
of
thy
molten
images
of
gold
thou
shalt
cast
them
away
as
a
menstruous
cloth
thou
shalt
say
unto
it
get
thee
hence
30
23
then
shall
he
give
the
rain
of
thy
seed
that
thou
shalt
sow
the
ground
withal
and
bread
of
the
increase
of
the
earth
and
it
shall
be
fat
and
plenteous
in
that
day
shall
thy
cattle
feed
in
large
pastures
30
24
the
oxen
likewise
and
the
young
asses
that
ear
the
ground
shall
eat
clean
provender
which
hath
been
winnowed
with
the
shovel
and
with
the
fan
30
25
and
there
shall
be
upon
every
high
mountain
and
upon
every
high
hill
rivers
and
streams
of
waters
in
the
day
of
the
great
slaughter
when
the
towers
fall
30
26
moreover
the
light
of
the
moon
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
light
of
the
sun
shall
be
sevenfold
as
the
light
of
seven
days
in
the
day
that
the
lord
bindeth
up
the
breach
of
his
people
and
healeth
the
stroke
of
their
wound
30
27
behold
the
name
of
the
lord
cometh
from
far
burning
with
his
anger
and
the
burden
thereof
is
heavy
his
lips
are
full
of
indignation
and
his
tongue
as
a
devouring
fire
30
28
and
his
breath
as
an
overflowing
stream
shall
reach
to
the
midst
of
the
neck
to
sift
the
nations
with
the
sieve
of
vanity
and
there
shall
be
a
bridle
in
the
jaws
of
the
people
causing
them
to
err
30
29
ye
shall
have
a
song
as
in
the
night
when
a
holy
solemnity
is
kept
and
gladness
of
heart
as
when
one
goeth
with
a
pipe
to
come
into
the
mountain
of
the
lord
to
the
mighty
one
of
israel
30
30
and
the
lord
shall
cause
his
glorious
voice
to
be
heard
and
shall
shew
the
lighting
down
of
his
arm
with
the
indignation
of
his
anger
and
with
the
flame
of
a
devouring
fire
with
scattering
and
tempest
and
hailstones
30
31
for
through
the
voice
of
the
lord
shall
the
assyrian
be
beaten
down
which
smote
with
a
rod
30
32
and
in
every
place
where
the
grounded
staff
shall
pass
which
the
lord
shall
lay
upon
him
it
shall
be
with
tabrets
and
harps
and
in
battles
of
shaking
will
he
fight
with
it
30
33
for
tophet
is
ordained
of
old
yea
for
the
king
it
is
prepared
he
hath
made
it
deep
and
large
the
pile
thereof
is
fire
and
much
wood
the
breath
of
the
lord
like
a
stream
of
brimstone
doth
kindle
it
31
1
woe
to
them
that
go
down
to
egypt
for
help
and
stay
on
horses
and
trust
in
chariots
because
they
are
many
and
in
horsemen
because
they
are
very
strong
but
they
look
not
unto
the
holy
one
of
israel
neither
seek
the
lord
31
2
yet
he
also
is
wise
and
will
bring
evil
and
will
not
call
back
his
words
but
will
arise
against
the
house
of
the
evildoers
and
against
the
help
of
them
that
work
iniquity
31
3
now
the
egyptians
are
men
and
not
god
and
their
horses
flesh
and
not
spirit
when
the
lord
shall
stretch
out
his
hand
both
he
that
helpeth
shall
fall
and
he
that
is
holpen
shall
fall
down
and
they
all
shall
fail
together
31
4
for
thus
hath
the
lord
spoken
unto
me
like
as
the
lion
and
the
young
lion
roaring
on
his
prey
when
a
multitude
of
shepherds
is
called
forth
against
him
he
will
not
be
afraid
of
their
voice
nor
abase
himself
for
the
noise
of
them
so
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
come
down
to
fight
for
mount
zion
and
for
the
hill
thereof
31
5
as
birds
flying
so
will
the
lord
of
hosts
defend
jerusalem
defending
also
he
will
deliver
it
and
passing
over
he
will
preserve
it
31
6
turn
ye
unto
him
from
whom
the
children
of
israel
have
deeply
revolted
31
7
for
in
that
day
every
man
shall
cast
away
his
idols
of
silver
and
his
idols
of
gold
which
your
own
hands
have
made
unto
you
for
a
sin
31
8
then
shall
the
assyrian
fall
with
the
sword
not
of
a
mighty
man
and
the
sword
not
of
a
mean
man
shall
devour
him
but
he
shall
flee
from
the
sword
and
his
young
men
shall
be
discomfited
31
9
and
he
shall
pass
over
to
his
strong
hold
for
fear
and
his
princes
shall
be
afraid
of
the
ensign
saith
the
lord
whose
fire
is
in
zion
and
his
furnace
in
jerusalem
32
1
behold
a
king
shall
reign
in
righteousness
and
princes
shall
rule
in
judgment
32
2
and
a
man
shall
be
as
an
hiding
place
from
the
wind
and
a
covert
from
the
tempest
as
rivers
of
water
in
a
dry
place
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
32
3
and
the
eyes
of
them
that
see
shall
not
be
dim
and
the
ears
of
them
that
hear
shall
hearken
32
4
the
heart
also
of
the
rash
shall
understand
knowledge
and
the
tongue
of
the
stammerers
shall
be
ready
to
speak
plainly
32
5
the
vile
person
shall
be
no
more
called
liberal
nor
the
churl
said
to
be
bountiful
32
6
for
the
vile
person
will
speak
villany
and
his
heart
will
work
iniquity
to
practise
hypocrisy
and
to
utter
error
against
the
lord
to
make
empty
the
soul
of
the
hungry
and
he
will
cause
the
drink
of
the
thirsty
to
fail
32
7
the
instruments
also
of
the
churl
are
evil
he
deviseth
wicked
devices
to
destroy
the
poor
with
lying
words
even
when
the
needy
speaketh
right
32
8
but
the
liberal
deviseth
liberal
things
and
by
liberal
things
shall
he
stand
32
9
rise
up
ye
women
that
are
at
ease
hear
my
voice
ye
careless
daughters
give
ear
unto
my
speech
32
10
many
days
and
years
shall
ye
be
troubled
ye
careless
women
for
the
vintage
shall
fail
the
gathering
shall
not
come
32
11
tremble
ye
women
that
are
at
ease
be
troubled
ye
careless
ones
strip
you
and
make
you
bare
and
gird
sackcloth
upon
your
loins
32
12
they
shall
lament
for
the
teats
for
the
pleasant
fields
for
the
fruitful
vine
32
13
upon
the
land
of
my
people
shall
come
up
thorns
and
briers
yea
upon
all
the
houses
of
joy
in
the
joyous
city
32
14
because
the
palaces
shall
be
forsaken
the
multitude
of
the
city
shall
be
left
the
forts
and
towers
shall
be
for
dens
for
ever
a
joy
of
wild
asses
a
pasture
of
flocks
32
15
until
the
spirit
be
poured
upon
us
from
on
high
and
the
wilderness
be
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
field
be
counted
for
a
forest
32
16
then
judgment
shall
dwell
in
the
wilderness
and
righteousness
remain
in
the
fruitful
field
32
17
and
the
work
of
righteousness
shall
be
peace
and
the
effect
of
righteousness
quietness
and
assurance
for
ever
32
18
and
my
people
shall
dwell
in
a
peaceable
habitation
and
in
sure
dwellings
and
in
quiet
resting
places
32
19
when
it
shall
hail
coming
down
on
the
forest
and
the
city
shall
be
low
in
a
low
place
32
20
blessed
are
ye
that
sow
beside
all
waters
that
send
forth
thither
the
feet
of
the
ox
and
the
ass
33
1
woe
to
thee
that
spoilest
and
thou
wast
not
spoiled
and
dealest
treacherously
and
they
dealt
not
treacherously
with
thee
when
thou
shalt
cease
to
spoil
thou
shalt
be
spoiled
and
when
thou
shalt
make
an
end
to
deal
treacherously
they
shall
deal
treacherously
with
thee
33
2
o
lord
be
gracious
unto
us
we
have
waited
for
thee
be
thou
their
arm
every
morning
our
salvation
also
in
the
time
of
trouble
33
3
at
the
noise
of
the
tumult
the
people
fled
at
the
lifting
up
of
thyself
the
nations
were
scattered
33
4
and
your
spoil
shall
be
gathered
like
the
gathering
of
the
caterpiller
as
the
running
to
and
fro
of
locusts
shall
he
run
upon
them
33
5
the
lord
is
exalted
for
he
dwelleth
on
high
he
hath
filled
zion
with
judgment
and
righteousness
33
6
and
wisdom
and
knowledge
shall
be
the
stability
of
thy
times
and
strength
of
salvation
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
his
treasure
33
7
behold
their
valiant
ones
shall
cry
without
the
ambassadors
of
peace
shall
weep
bitterly
33
8
the
highways
lie
waste
the
wayfaring
man
ceaseth
he
hath
broken
the
covenant
he
hath
despised
the
cities
he
regardeth
no
man
33
9
the
earth
mourneth
and
languisheth
lebanon
is
ashamed
and
hewn
down
sharon
is
like
a
wilderness
and
bashan
and
carmel
shake
off
their
fruits
33
10
now
will
i
rise
saith
the
lord
now
will
i
be
exalted
now
will
i
lift
up
myself
33
11
ye
shall
conceive
chaff
ye
shall
bring
forth
stubble
your
breath
as
fire
shall
devour
you
33
12
and
the
people
shall
be
as
the
burnings
of
lime
as
thorns
cut
up
shall
they
be
burned
in
the
fire
33
13
hear
ye
that
are
far
off
what
i
have
done
and
ye
that
are
near
acknowledge
my
might
33
14
the
sinners
in
zion
are
afraid
fearfulness
hath
surprised
the
hypocrites
who
among
us
shall
dwell
with
the
devouring
fire
who
among
us
shall
dwell
with
everlasting
burnings
33
15
he
that
walketh
righteously
and
speaketh
uprightly
he
that
despiseth
the
gain
of
oppressions
that
shaketh
his
hands
from
holding
of
bribes
that
stoppeth
his
ears
from
hearing
of
blood
and
shutteth
his
eyes
from
seeing
evil
33
16
he
shall
dwell
on
high
his
place
of
defence
shall
be
the
munitions
of
rocks
bread
shall
be
given
him
his
waters
shall
be
sure
33
17
thine
eyes
shall
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
they
shall
behold
the
land
that
is
very
far
off
33
18
thine
heart
shall
meditate
terror
where
is
the
scribe
where
is
the
receiver
where
is
he
that
counted
the
towers
33
19
thou
shalt
not
see
a
fierce
people
a
people
of
a
deeper
speech
than
thou
canst
perceive
of
a
stammering
tongue
that
thou
canst
not
understand
33
20
look
upon
zion
the
city
of
our
solemnities
thine
eyes
shall
see
jerusalem
a
quiet
habitation
a
tabernacle
that
shall
not
be
taken
down
not
one
of
the
stakes
thereof
shall
ever
be
removed
neither
shall
any
of
the
cords
thereof
be
broken
33
21
but
there
the
glorious
lord
will
be
unto
us
a
place
of
broad
rivers
and
streams
wherein
shall
go
no
galley
with
oars
neither
shall
gallant
ship
pass
thereby
33
22
for
the
lord
is
our
judge
the
lord
is
our
lawgiver
the
lord
is
our
king
he
will
save
us
33
23
thy
tacklings
are
loosed
they
could
not
well
strengthen
their
mast
they
could
not
spread
the
sail
then
is
the
prey
of
a
great
spoil
divided
the
lame
take
the
prey
33
24
and
the
inhabitant
shall
not
say
i
am
sick
the
people
that
dwell
therein
shall
be
forgiven
their
iniquity
34
1
come
near
ye
nations
to
hear
and
hearken
ye
people
let
the
earth
hear
and
all
that
is
therein
the
world
and
all
things
that
come
forth
of
it
34
2
for
the
indignation
of
the
lord
is
upon
all
nations
and
his
fury
upon
all
their
armies
he
hath
utterly
destroyed
them
he
hath
delivered
them
to
the
slaughter
34
3
their
slain
also
shall
be
cast
out
and
their
stink
shall
come
up
out
of
their
carcases
and
the
mountains
shall
be
melted
with
their
blood
34
4
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
shall
be
dissolved
and
the
heavens
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
and
all
their
host
shall
fall
down
as
the
leaf
falleth
off
from
the
vine
and
as
a
falling
fig
from
the
fig
tree
34
5
for
my
sword
shall
be
bathed
in
heaven
behold
it
shall
come
down
upon
idumea
and
upon
the
people
of
my
curse
to
judgment
34
6
the
sword
of
the
lord
is
filled
with
blood
it
is
made
fat
with
fatness
and
with
the
blood
of
lambs
and
goats
with
the
fat
of
the
kidneys
of
rams
for
the
lord
hath
a
sacrifice
in
bozrah
and
a
great
slaughter
in
the
land
of
idumea
34
7
and
the
unicorns
shall
come
down
with
them
and
the
bullocks
with
the
bulls
and
their
land
shall
be
soaked
with
blood
and
their
dust
made
fat
with
fatness
34
8
for
it
is
the
day
of
the
lord’s
vengeance
and
the
year
of
recompences
for
the
controversy
of
zion
34
9
and
the
streams
thereof
shall
be
turned
into
pitch
and
the
dust
thereof
into
brimstone
and
the
land
thereof
shall
become
burning
pitch
34
10
it
shall
not
be
quenched
night
nor
day
the
smoke
thereof
shall
go
up
for
ever
from
generation
to
generation
it
shall
lie
waste
none
shall
pass
through
it
for
ever
and
ever
34
11
but
the
cormorant
and
the
bittern
shall
possess
it
the
owl
also
and
the
raven
shall
dwell
in
it
and
he
shall
stretch
out
upon
it
the
line
of
confusion
and
the
stones
of
emptiness
34
12
they

nothing
34
13
and
thorns
shall
come
up
in
her
palaces
nettles
and
brambles
in
the
fortresses
thereof
and
it
shall
be
an
habitation
of
dragons
and
a
court
for
owls
34
14
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
shall
also
meet
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
island
and
the
satyr
shall
cry
to
his
fellow
the
screech
owl
also
shall
rest
there
and
find
for
herself
a
place
of
rest
34
15
there
shall
the
great
owl
make
her
nest
and
lay
and
hatch
and
gather
under
her
shadow
there
shall
the
vultures
also
be
gathered
every
one
with
her
mate
34
16
seek
ye
out
of

book
of
the
lord
and
read
no
one
of
these
shall
fail
none
shall
want
her
mate
for
my
mouth
it
hath
commanded
and
his
spirit
it
hath
gathered
them
34
17
and
he
hath
cast
the
lot
for
them
and
his
hand
hath
divided
it
unto
them
by
line
they
shall
possess
it
for
ever
from
generation
to
generation
shall
they
dwell
therein
35
1
the
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
shall
be
glad
for
them
and
the
desert
shall
rejoice
and
blossom
as
the
rose
35
2
it
shall
blossom
abundantly
and
rejoice
even
with
joy
and
singing
the
glory
of
lebanon
shall
be
given
unto
it
the
excellency
of
carmel
and
sharon
they
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
the
excellency
of
our
god
35
3
strengthen
ye
the
weak
hands
and
confirm
the
feeble
knees
35
4
say
to
them
that
are
of
a
fearful
heart
be
strong
fear
not
behold
your
god
will
come
with
vengeance
even
god
with
a
recompence
he
will
come
and
save
you
35
5
then
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
be
opened
and
the
ears
of
the
deaf
shall
be
unstopped
35
6
then
shall
the
lame
man
leap
as
an
hart
and
the
tongue
of
the
dumb
sing
for
in
the
wilderness
shall
waters
break
out
and
streams
in
the
desert
35
7
and
the
parched
ground
shall
become
a
pool
and
the
thirsty
land
springs
of
water
in
the
habitation
of
dragons
where
each
lay
shall
be
grass
with
reeds
and
rushes
35
8
and
an
highway
shall
be
there
and
a
way
and
it
shall
be
called
the
way
of
holiness
the
unclean
shall
not
pass
over
it
but
it
shall
be
for
those
the
wayfaring
men
though
fools
shall
not
err
therein
35
9
no
lion
shall
be
there
nor
any
ravenous
beast
shall
go
up
thereon
it
shall
not
be
found
there
but
the
redeemed
shall
walk
there
35
10
and
the
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
to
zion
with
songs
and
everlasting
joy
upon
their
heads
they
shall
obtain
joy
and
gladness
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
36
1
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
hezekiah
that
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
came
up
against
all
the
defenced
cities
of
judah
and
took
them
36
2
and
the
king
of
assyria
sent
rabshakeh
from
lachish
to
jerusalem
unto
king
hezekiah
with
a
great
army
and
he
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller’s
field
36
3
then
came
forth
unto
him
eliakim
hilkiah’s
son
which
was
over
the
house
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
asaph’s
son
the
recorder
36
4
and
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
say
ye
now
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
what
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest
36
5
i
say
sayest
thou
(but
they
are
but
vain
words)
i
have
counsel
and
strength
for
war
now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
rebellest
against
me
36
6
lo
thou
trustest
in
the
staff
of
this
broken
reed
on
egypt
whereon
if
a
man
lean
it
will
go
into
his
hand
and
pierce
it
so
is
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
to
all
that
trust
in
him
36
7
but
if
thou
say
to
me
we
trust
in
the
lord
our
god
is
it
not
he
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
hezekiah
hath
taken
away
and
said
to
judah
and
to
jerusalem
ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar
36
8
now
therefore
give
pledges
i
pray
thee
to
my
master
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
give
thee
two
thousand
horses
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them
36
9
how
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master’s
servants
and
put
thy
trust
on
egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
36
10
and
am
i
now
come
up
without
the
lord
against
this
land
to
destroy
it
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
36
11
then
said
eliakim
and
shebna
and
joah
unto
rabshakeh
speak
i
pray
thee
unto
thy
servants
in
the
syrian
language
for
we
understand
it
and
speak
not
to
us
in
the
jews’
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall
36
12
but
rabshakeh
said
hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master
and
to
thee
to
speak
these
words
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
that
sit
upon
the
wall
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you
36
13
then
rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews’
language
and
said
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
36
14
thus
saith
the
king
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
36
15
neither
let
hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
lord
saying
the
lord
will
surely
deliver
us
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
36
16
hearken
not
to
hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
assyria
make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present
and
come
out
to
me
and
eat
ye
every
one
of
his
vine
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
own
cistern
36
17
until
i
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
36
18
beware
lest
hezekiah
persuade
you
saying
the
lord
will
deliver
us
hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
36
19
where
are
the
gods
of
hamath
and
arphad
where
are
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
and
have
they
delivered
samaria
out
of
my
hand
36
20
who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
these
lands
that
have
delivered
their
land
out
of
my
hand
that
the
lord
should
deliver
jerusalem
out
of
my
hand
36
21
but
they
held
their
peace
and
answered
him
not
a
word
for
the
king’s
commandment
was
saying
answer
him
not
36
22
then
came
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
that
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
to
hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent
and
told
him
the
words
of
rabshakeh
37
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
hezekiah
heard
it
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
37
2
and
he
sent
eliakim
who
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
unto
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
37
3
and
they
said
unto
him
thus
saith
hezekiah
this
day
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
rebuke
and
of
blasphemy
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth
37
4
it
may
be
the
lord
thy
god
will
hear
the
words
of
rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
and
will
reprove
the
words
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
heard
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
is
left
37
5
so
the
servants
of
king
hezekiah
came
to
isaiah
37
6
and
isaiah
said
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
master
thus
saith
the
lord
be
not
afraid
of
the
words
that
thou
hast
heard
wherewith
the
servants
of
the
king
of
assyria
have
blasphemed
me
37
7
behold
i
will
send
a
blast
upon
him
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour
and
return
to
his
own
land
and
i
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
37
8
so
rabshakeh
returned
and
found
the
king
of
assyria
warring
against
libnah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
lachish
37
9
and
he
heard
say
concerning
tirhakah
king
of
ethiopia
he
is
come
forth
to
make
war
with
thee
and
when
he
heard
it
he
sent
messengers
to
hezekiah
saying
37
10
thus
shall
ye
speak
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
saying
let
not
thy
god
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
jerusalem
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
37
11
behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered
37
12
have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed
as
gozan
and
haran
and
rezeph
and
the
children
of
eden
which
were
in
telassar
37
13
where
is
the
king
of
hamath
and
the
king
of
arphad
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
sepharvaim
hena
and
ivah
37
14
and
hezekiah
received
the
letter
from
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
it
and
hezekiah
went
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
spread
it
before
the
lord
37
15
and
hezekiah
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
37
16
o
lord
of
hosts
god
of
israel
that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
thou
art
the
god
even
thou
alone
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
37
17
incline
thine
ear
o
lord
and
hear
open
thine
eyes
o
lord
and
see
and
hear
all
the
words
of
sennacherib
which
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
37
18
of
a
truth
lord
the
kings
of
assyria
have
laid
waste
all
the
nations
and
their
countries
37
19
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
no
gods
but
the
work
of
men’s
hands
wood
and
stone
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
37
20
now
therefore
o
lord
our
god
save
us
from
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
even
thou
only
37
21
then
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
sent
unto
hezekiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
whereas
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
37
22
this
is
the
word
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
him
the
virgin
the
daughter
of
zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee
37
23
whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high
even
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
37
24
by
thy
servants
hast
thou
reproached
the
lord
and
hast
said
by
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
am
i
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains
to
the
sides
of
lebanon
and
i
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedars
thereof
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof
and
i
will
enter
into
the
height
of
his
border
and
the
forest
of
his
carmel
37
25
i
have
digged
and
drunk
water
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
i
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
the
besieged
places
37
26
hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago
how
i
have
done
it
and
of
ancient
times
that
i
have
formed
it
now
have
i
brought
it
to
pass
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
defenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps
37
27
therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field
and
as
the
green
herb
as
the
grass
on
the
housetops
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up
37
28
but
i
know
thy
abode
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
thy
rage
against
me
37
29
because
thy
rage
against
me
and
thy
tumult
is
come
up
into
mine
ears
therefore
will
i
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest
37
30
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
as
groweth
of
itself
and
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye
and
reap
and
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruit
thereof
37
31
and
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
judah
shall
again
take
root
downward
and
bear
fruit
upward
37
32
for
out
of
jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
zion
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
do
this
37
33
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
king
of
assyria
he
shall
not
come
into
this
city
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there
nor
come
before
it
with
shields
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it
37
34
by
the
way
that
he
came
by
the
same
shall
he
return
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city
saith
the
lord
37
35
for
i
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david’s
sake
37
36
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
forth
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
a
hundred
and
fourscore
and
five
thousand
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
they
were
all
dead
corpses
37
37
so
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
departed
and
went
and
returned
and
dwelt
at
nineveh
37
38
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
nisroch
his
god
that
adrammelech
and
sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
armenia
and
esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
38
1
in
those
days
was
hezekiah
sick
unto
death
and
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
came
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
set
thine
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
live
38
2
then
hezekiah
turned
his
face
toward
the
wall
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
38
3
and
said
remember
now
o
lord
i
beseech
thee
how
i
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight
and
hezekiah
wept
sore
38
4
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
to
isaiah
saying
38
5
go
and
say
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
lord

father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
38

and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
defend
this
city
38
7
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
from
the
lord
that
the
lord
will
do
this
thing
that
he
hath
spoken
38
8
behold
i
will
bring
again
the
shadow
of
the
degrees
which
is
gone
down
in
the
sun
dial
of
ahaz
ten
degrees
backward
so
the
sun
returned
ten
degrees
by
which
degrees
it
was
gone
down

the
writing
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
when
he
had
been
sick
and
was
recovered
of
his
sickness
38
10
i
said
in
the
cutting
off
of
my
days
i
shall
go
to
the
gates
of
the
grave
i
am
deprived
of
the
residue
of
my
years
38
11
i
said
i
shall
not
see
the
lord
even
the
lord
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
shall
behold
man
no
more
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
38
12
mine
age
is
departed
and
is
removed
from
me
as
a
shepherd’s
tent
i
have
cut
off
like
a
weaver
my
life
he
will
cut
me
off
with
pining
sickness
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me
38
13
i
reckoned
till
morning
that
as
a
lion
so
will
he
break
all
my
bones
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me
38
14
like
a
crane
or
a
swallow
so
did
i
chatter
i
did
mourn
as
a
dove
mine
eyes
fail
with
looking
upward
o
lord
i
am
oppressed
undertake
for
me
38
15
what
shall
i
say
he
hath
both
spoken
unto
me
and
himself
hath
done
it
i
shall
go
softly
all
my
years
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
38
16
o
lord
by
these
things
men
live
and
in
all
these
things
is
the
life
of
my
spirit
so
wilt
thou
recover
me
and
make
me
to
live
38
17
behold
for
peace
i
had
great
bitterness
but
thou
hast
in
love
to
my
soul
delivered
it
from
the
pit
of
corruption
for
thou
hast
cast
all
my
sins
behind
thy
back
38
18
for
the
grave
cannot
praise
thee
death
can
not
celebrate
thee
they
that
go
down
into
the
pit
cannot
hope
for
thy
truth
38
19
the
living
the
living
he
shall
praise
thee
as
i
do
this
day
the
father
to
the
children
shall
make
known
thy
truth
38
20
the
lord
was
ready
to
save
me
therefore
we
will
sing
my
songs
to
the
stringed
instruments
all
the
days
of
our
life
in
the
house
of
the
lord
38
21
for
isaiah
had
said
let
them
take
a
lump
of
figs
and
lay
it
for
a
plaister
upon
the
boil
and
he
shall
recover
38
22
hezekiah
also
had
said
what
is
the
sign
that
i
shall
go
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
39
1
at
that
time
merodachbaladan
the
son
of
baladan
king
of
babylon
sent
letters
and
a
present
to
hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick
and
was
recovered
39
2
and
hezekiah
was
glad
of
them
and
shewed
them
the
house
of
his
precious
things
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
spices
and
the
precious
ointment
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
nor
in
all
his
dominion
that
hezekiah
shewed
them
not
39
3
then
came
isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
what
said
these
men
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee
and
hezekiah
said
they
are
come
from
a
far
country
unto
me
even
from
babylon
39
4
then
said
he
what
have
they
seen
in
thine
house
and
hezekiah
answered
all
that
is
in
mine
house
have
they
seen
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
i
have
not
shewed
them
39
5
then
said
isaiah
to
hezekiah
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
of
hosts
39
6
behold
the
days
come
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
until
this
day
shall
be
carried
to
babylon
nothing
shall
be
left
saith
the
lord
39
7
and
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee
which
thou
shalt
beget
shall
they
take
away
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
babylon
39
8
then
said
hezekiah
to
isaiah
good
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
thou
hast
spoken
he
said
moreover
for
there
shall
be
peace
and
truth
in
my
days
40
1
comfort
ye
comfort
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
40
2
speak
ye
comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord’s
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
40
3
the
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
40
4
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
40
5
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
40
6
the
voice
said
cry
and
he
said
what
shall
i
cry
all
flesh
is
grass
and
all
the
goodliness
thereof
is
as
the
flower
of
the
field
40
7
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
because
the
spirit
of
the
lord
bloweth
upon
it
surely
the
people
is
grass
40
8
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
but
the
word
of
our
god
shall
stand
for
ever
40
9
o
zion
that
bringest
good
tidings
get
thee
up
into
the
high
mountain
o
jerusalem
that
bringest
good
tidings
lift
up
thy
voice
with
strength
lift
it
up
be
not
afraid
say
unto
the
cities
of
judah
behold
your
god
40
10
behold
the
lord
god
will
come
with
strong
hand
and
his
arm
shall
rule
for
him
behold
his
reward
is
with
him
and
his
work
before
him
40
11
he
shall
feed
his
flock
like
a
shepherd
he
shall
gather
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom
and
shall
gently
lead
those
that
are
with
young
40
12
who
hath
measured
the
waters
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
meted
out
heaven
with
the
span
and
comprehended
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
a
measure
and
weighed
the
mountains
in
scales
and
the
hills
in
a
balance
40
13
who
hath
directed
the
spirit
of
the
lord
or
being
his
counsellor
hath
taught
him
40
14
with
whom
took
he
counsel
and
who
instructed
him
and
taught
him
in
the
path
of
judgment
and
taught
him
knowledge
and
shewed
to
him
the
way
of
understanding
40
15
behold
the
nations
are
as
a
drop
of
a
bucket
and
are
counted
as
the
small
dust
of
the
balance
behold
he
taketh
up
the
isles
as
a
very
little
thing
40
16
and
lebanon
is
not
sufficient
to
burn
nor
the
beasts
thereof
sufficient
for
a
burnt
offering
40
17
all
nations
before
him
are
as
nothing
and
they
are
counted
to
him
less
than
nothing
and
vanity
40
18
to
whom
then
will
ye
liken
god
or
what
likeness
will
ye
compare
unto
him
40
19
the
workman
melteth
a
graven
image
and
the
goldsmith
spreadeth
it
over
with
gold
and
casteth
silver
chains
40
20
he
that
is
so
impoverished
that
he
hath
no
oblation
chooseth
a
tree
that
will
not
rot
he
seeketh
unto
him
a
cunning
workman
to
prepare
a
graven
image
that
shall
not
be
moved
40
21
have
ye
not
known
have
ye
not
heard
hath
it
not
been
told
you
from
the
beginning
have
ye
not
understood
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth
40
22
it
is
he
that
sitteth
upon
the
circle
of
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
as
grasshoppers
that
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
as
a
curtain
and
spreadeth
them
out
as
a
tent
to
dwell
in
40
23
that
bringeth
the
princes
to
nothing
he
maketh
the
judges
of
the
earth
as
vanity
40
24
yea
they
shall
not
be
planted
yea
they
shall
not
be
sown
yea
their
stock
shall
not
take
root
in
the
earth
and
he
shall
also
blow
upon
them
and
they
shall
wither
and
the
whirlwind
shall
take
them
away
as
stubble
40
25
to
whom
then
will
ye
liken
me
or
shall
i
be
equal
saith
the
holy
one
40
26
lift
up
your
eyes
on
high
and
behold
who
hath
created
these
things
that
bringeth
out
their
host
by
number
he
calleth
them
all
by
names
by
the
greatness
of
his
might
for
that
he
is
strong
in
power
not
one
faileth
40
27
why
sayest
thou
o
jacob
and
speakest
o
israel
my
way
is
hid
from
the
lord
and
my
judgment
is
passed
over
from
my
god
40
28
hast
thou
not
known
hast
thou
not
heard
that
the
everlasting
god
the
lord
the
creator
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
fainteth
not
neither
is
weary
there
is
no
searching
of
his
understanding
40
29
he
giveth
power
to
the
faint
and
to
them
that
have
no
might
he
increaseth
strength
40
30
even
the
youths
shall
faint
and
be
weary
and
the
young
men
shall
utterly
fall
40
31
but
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
they
shall
mount
up
with
wings
as
eagles
they
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
and
they
shall
walk
and
not
faint
41
1
keep
silence
before
me
o
islands
and
let
the
people
renew
their
strength
let
them
come
near
then
let
them
speak
let
us
come
near
together
to
judgment
41
2
who
raised
up
the
righteous
man
from
the
east
called
him
to
his
foot
gave
the
nations
before
him
and
made
him
rule
over
kings
he
gave
them
as
the
dust
to
his
sword
and
as
driven
stubble
to
his
bow
41
3
he
pursued
them
and
passed
safely
even
by
the
way
that
he
had
not
gone
with
his
feet
41
4
who
hath
wrought
and
done
it
calling
the
generations
from
the
beginning
i
the
lord
the
first
and
with
the
last
i
am
he
41
5
the
isles
saw
it
and
feared
the
ends
of
the
earth
were
afraid
drew
near
and
came
41
6
they
helped
every
one
his
neighbour
and
every
one
said
to
his
brother
be
of
good
courage
41
7
so
the
carpenter
encouraged
the
goldsmith
and
he
that
smootheth
with
the
hammer
him
that
smote
the
anvil
saying
it
is
ready
for
the
sodering
and
he
fastened
it
with
nails
that
it
should
not
be
moved
41
8
but
thou
israel
art
my
servant
jacob
whom
i
have
chosen
the
seed
of
abraham
my
friend
41
9
thou
whom
i
have
taken
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
called
thee
from
the
chief
men
thereof
and
said
unto
thee
thou
art
my
servant
i
have
chosen
thee
and
not
cast
thee
away
41
10
fear
thou
not
for
i
am
with
thee
be
not
dismayed
for
i
am
thy
god
i
will
strengthen
thee
yea
i
will
help
thee
yea
i
will
uphold
thee
with
the
right
hand
of
my
righteousness
41
11
behold
all
they
that
were
incensed
against
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
confounded
they
shall
be
as
nothing
and
they
that
strive
with
thee
shall
perish
41
12
thou
shalt
seek
them
and
shalt
not
find
them
even
them
that
contended
with
thee
they
that
war
against
thee
shall
be
as
nothing
and
as
a
thing
of
nought
41
13
for
i
the
lord
thy
god
will
hold
thy
right
hand
saying
unto
thee
fear
not
i
will
help
thee
41
14
fear
not
thou
worm
jacob
and
ye
men
of
israel
i
will
help
thee
saith
the
lord
and
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
41
15
behold
i
will
make
thee
a
new
sharp
threshing
instrument
having
teeth
thou
shalt
thresh
the
mountains
and
beat
them
small
and
shalt
make
the
hills
as
chaff
41
16
thou
shalt
fan
them
and
the
wind
shall
carry
them
away
and
the
whirlwind
shall
scatter
them
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
the
lord
and
shalt
glory
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
41
17
when
the
poor
and
needy
seek
water
and
there
is
none
and
their
tongue
faileth
for
thirst
i
the
lord
will
hear
them
i
the
god
of
israel
will
not
forsake
them
41
18
i
will
open
rivers
in
high
places
and
fountains
in
the
midst
of
the
valleys
i
will
make
the
wilderness
a
pool
of
water
and
the
dry
land
springs
of
water
41
19
i
will
plant
in
the
wilderness
the
cedar

shittah
tree
and

forth
and

shew
the
former
things
what
they
be

us
things
for
to
come

shew
the
things
that

come
hereafter
that
we
may
know
that
ye
are

evil
that
we
may
be
dismayed

together
41
24
behold
ye
are
of
nothing
and
your
work
of
nought
an
abomination
is
he
that
chooseth
you
41
25
i
have
raised
up
one
from
the
north
and
he
shall
come
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
shall
he
call
upon
my
name
and
he
shall
come
upon
princes
as
upon
morter
and
as
the
potter
treadeth
clay
41
26
who
hath
declared
from
the
beginning
that
we
may
know
and
beforetime
that
we
may
say
he
is
righteous
yea
there
is
none
that

yea
there
is
none
that

to
zion
behold
behold
them
and
i
will
give
to
jerusalem
one
that
bringeth
good
tidings
41
28
for
i
beheld
and
there
was
no
man
even
among
them
and
there
was
no
counsellor
that
when
i
asked
of
them
could
answer
a
word
41
29
behold
they
are
all
vanity
their
works
are
nothing
their
molten
images
are
wind
and
confusion
42

behold
my
servant
whom
i
uphold
mine
elect
in
whom
my
soul
delighteth
i
have
put
my
spirit
upon
him
he
shall
bring
forth
judgment
to
the
gentiles
42

he
shall
not
cry
nor
lift
up
nor
cause
his
voice
to
be
heard
in
the
street
42
3
a
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break
and
the
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench
he
shall
bring
forth
judgment
unto
truth
42
4
he
shall
not
fail
nor
be
discouraged
till
he
have
set
judgment
in
the
earth
and
the
isles
shall
wait
for
his
law
42
5
thus
saith
god
the
lord
he
that
created
the
heavens
and
stretched
them
out
he
that
spread
forth
the
earth
and
that
which
cometh
out
of
it
he
that
giveth
breath
unto
the
people
upon
it
and
spirit
to
them
that
walk
therein
42
6
i
the
lord
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
42
7
to
open
the
blind
eyes
to
bring
out
the
prisoners
from
the
prison
and
them
that
sit
in
darkness
out
of
the
prison
house
42
8
i
am
the
lord
that
is
my
name
and
my
glory
will
i
not
give
to
another
neither
my
praise
to
graven
images
42
9
behold
the
former
things
are
come
to
pass
and
new
things
do
i
declare
before
they
spring
forth
i
tell
you
of
them
42
10
sing
unto
the
lord
a
new
song
and
his
praise
from
the
end
of
the
earth
ye
that
go
down
to
the
sea
and
all
that
is
therein
the
isles
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
42
11
let
the
wilderness
and
the
cities
thereof
lift
up
their
voice
the
villages
that
kedar
doth
inhabit
let
the
inhabitants
of
the
rock
sing
let
them
shout
from
the
top
of
the
mountains
42
12
let
them
give
glory
unto
the
lord
and
declare
his
praise
in
the
islands
42
13
the
lord
shall
go
forth
as
a
mighty
man
he
shall
stir
up
jealousy
like
a
man
of
war
he
shall
cry
yea
roar
he
shall
prevail
against
his
enemies
42
14
i
have
long
time
holden
my
peace
i
have
been
still
and
refrained
myself
now
will
i
cry
like
a
travailing
woman
i
will
destroy
and
devour
at
once
42
15
i
will
make
waste
mountains
and
hills
and
dry
up
all
their
herbs
and
i
will
make
the
rivers
islands
and
i
will
dry
up
the
pools
42
16
and
i
will
bring
the
blind
by
a
way
that
they
knew
not
i
will
lead
them
in
paths
that
they
have
not
known
i
will
make
darkness
light
before
them
and
crooked
things
straight
these
things
will
i
do
unto
them
and
not
forsake
them
42
17
they
shall
be
turned
back
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed
that
trust
in
graven
images
that
say
to
the
molten
images
ye
are
our
gods
42
18
hear
ye
deaf
and
look
ye
blind
that
ye
may
see
42
19
who
is
blind
but
my
servant
or
deaf
as
my
messenger
that
i
sent
who
is
blind
as
he
that
is
perfect
and
blind
as
the
lord’s
servant
42
20
seeing
many
things
but
thou
observest
not
opening
the
ears
but
he
heareth
not
42
21
the
lord
is
well
pleased
for
his
righteousness’
sake
he
will
magnify
the
law
and
make
it
honourable
42
22
but
this
is
a
people
robbed
and
spoiled
they
are
all
of
them
snared
in
holes
and
they
are
hid
in
prison
houses
they
are
for
a
prey
and
none
delivereth
for
a
spoil
and
none
saith
restore
42
23
who
among
you
will
give
ear
to
this
who
will
hearken
and
hear
for
the
time
to
come
42
24
who
gave
jacob
for
a
spoil
and
israel
to
the
robbers
did
not
the
lord
he
against
whom
we
have
sinned
for
they
would
not
walk
in
his
ways
neither
were
they
obedient
unto
his
law
42
25
therefore
he
hath
poured
upon
him
the
fury
of
his
anger
and
the
strength
of
battle
and
it
hath
set
him
on
fire
round
about
yet
he
knew
not
and
it
burned
him
yet
he
laid
it
not
to
heart
43
1
but
now
thus
saith
the
lord
that
created
thee
o
jacob
and
he
that
formed
thee
o
israel
fear
not
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
i
have
called
thee
by
thy
name
thou
art
mine
43
2
when
thou
passest
through
the
waters
i
will
be
with
thee
and
through
the
rivers
they
shall
not
overflow
thee
when
thou
walkest
through
the
fire
thou
shalt
not
be
burned
neither
shall
the
flame
kindle
upon
thee
43
3
for
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
thy
saviour
i
gave
egypt
for
thy
ransom
ethiopia
and
seba
for
thee
43
4
since
thou
wast
precious
in
my
sight
thou
hast
been
honourable
and
i
have
loved
thee
therefore
will
i
give
men
for
thee
and
people
for
thy
life
43
5
fear
not
for
i
am
with
thee
i
will
bring
thy
seed
from
the
east
and
gather
thee
from
the
west
43
6
i
will
say
to
the
north
give
up
and
to
the
south
keep
not
back
bring
my
sons
from
far
and
my
daughters
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
43
7
even
every
one
that
is
called
by
my
name
for
i
have
created
him
for
my
glory
i
have
formed
him
yea
i
have
made
him
43
8
bring
forth
the
blind
people
that
have
eyes
and
the
deaf
that
have
ears
43
9
let
all
the
nations
be
gathered
together
and
let
the
people
be
assembled
who
among
them
can
declare
this
and
shew
us
former
things
let
them
bring
forth
their
witnesses
that
they
may
be
justified
or
let
them
hear
and
say
it
is
truth
43
10
ye
are
my
witnesses
saith
the
lord
and
my
servant
whom
i
have
chosen
that
ye
may
know
and
believe
me
and
understand
that
i
am
he
before
me
there
was
no
god
formed
neither
shall
there
be
after
me
43
11
i
even
i
am
the
lord
and
beside
me
there
is
no
saviour
43
12
i
have
declared
and
have
saved
and
i
have
shewed
when
there
was
no
strange
god
among
you
therefore
ye
are
my
witnesses
saith
the
lord
that
i
am
god
43
13
yea
before
the
day
was
i
am
he
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
my
hand
i
will
work
and
who
shall
let
it
43
14
thus
saith
the
lord
your
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
your
sake
i
have
sent
to
babylon
and
have
brought
down
all
their
nobles
and
the
chaldeans
whose
cry
is
in
the
ships
43
15
i
am
the
lord
your
holy
one
the
creator
of
israel
your
king
43
16
thus
saith
the
lord
which
maketh
a
way
in
the
sea
and
a
path
in
the
mighty
waters
43
17
which
bringeth
forth
the
chariot
and
horse
the
army
and
the
power
they
shall
lie
down
together
they
shall
not
rise
they
are
extinct
they
are
quenched
as
tow
43
18
remember
ye
not
the
former
things
neither
consider
the
things
of
old
43
19
behold
i
will
do
a
new
thing
now
it
shall
spring
forth
shall
ye
not
know
it
i
will
even
make
a
way
in
the
wilderness
and
rivers
in
the
desert
43
20
the
beast
of
the
field
shall
honour
me
the
dragons
and
the
owls
because
i
give
waters
in
the
wilderness
and
rivers
in
the
desert
to
give
drink
to
my
people
my
chosen
43
21
this
people
have
i
formed
for
myself
they
shall
shew
forth
my
praise
43
22
but
thou
hast
not
called
upon
me
o
jacob
but
thou
hast
been
weary
of
me
o
israel
43
23
thou
hast
not
brought
me
the
small
cattle
of
thy
burnt
offerings
neither
hast
thou
honoured
me
with
thy
sacrifices
i
have
not
caused
thee
to
serve
with
an
offering
nor
wearied
thee
with
incense
43
24
thou
hast
bought
me
no
sweet
cane
with
money
neither
hast
thou
filled
me
with
the
fat
of
thy
sacrifices
but
thou
hast
made
me
to
serve
with
thy
sins
thou
hast
wearied
me
with
thine
iniquities
43
25
i
even
i
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
sake
and
will
not
remember
thy
sins
43
26
put
me
in
remembrance
let
us
plead
together
declare
thou
that
thou
mayest
be
justified
43
27
thy
first
father
hath
sinned
and
thy
teachers
have
transgressed
against
me
43
28
therefore
i
have
profaned
the
princes
of
the
sanctuary
and
have
given
jacob
to
the
curse
and
israel
to
reproaches
44
1
yet
now
hear
o
jacob
my
servant
and
israel
whom
i
have
chosen
44
2
thus
saith
the
lord
that
made
thee
and
formed
thee
from
the
womb
which
will
help
thee
fear
not
o
jacob
my
servant
and
thou
jesurun
whom
i
have
chosen
44
3
for
i
will
pour
water
upon
him
that
is
thirsty
and
floods
upon
the
dry
ground
i
will
pour
my
spirit
upon
thy
seed
and
my
blessing
upon
thine
offspring
44
4
and
they
shall
spring
up
as
among
the
grass
as
willows
by
the
water
courses
44
5
one
shall
say
i
am
the
lord’s
and
another
shall
call
himself
by
the
name
of
jacob
and
another
shall
subscribe
with
his
hand
unto
the
lord
and
surname
himself
by
the
name
of
israel
44
6
thus
saith
the
lord
the
king
of
israel
and
his
redeemer
the
lord
of
hosts
i
am
the
first
and
i
am
the
last
and
beside
me
there
is
no
god
44
7
and
who
as
i
shall
call
and
shall
declare
it
and
set
it
in
order
for
me
since
i
appointed
the
ancient
people
and
the
things
that
are
coming
and
shall
come
let
them
shew
unto
them
44
8
fear
ye
not
neither
be
afraid
have
not
i
told
thee
from
that
time
and
have
declared
it
ye
are
even
my
witnesses
is
there
a
god
beside
me
yea
there
is
no
god
i
know
not
any
44
9
they
that
make
a
graven
image
are
all
of
them
vanity
and
their
delectable
things
shall
not
profit
and
they
are
their
own
witnesses
they
see
not
nor
know
that
they
may
be
ashamed
44
10
who
hath
formed
a
god
or
molten
a
graven
image
that
is
profitable
for
nothing
44
11
behold
all
his
fellows
shall
be
ashamed
and
the
workmen
they
are
of
men
let
them
all
be
gathered
together
let
them
stand
up
yet
they
shall
fear
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
together
44
12
the
smith
with
the
tongs
both
worketh
in
the
coals
and
fashioneth
it
with
hammers
and
worketh
it
with
the
strength
of
his
arms
yea
he
is
hungry
and
his
strength
faileth
he
drinketh
no
water
and

13
the
carpenter
stretcheth
out
his
rule
he
marketh
it
out
with
a
line
he
fitteth
it
with
planes
and
he
marketh
it
out
with
the
compass
and
maketh
it
after
the
figure
of
a
man
according
to
the
beauty
of
a
man
that
it
may
remain
in
the
house
44
14
he
heweth
him
down
cedars
and
taketh
the
cypress
and
the
oak
which
he
strengtheneth
for
himself
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
he
planteth
an
ash
and
the
rain
doth
nourish
it
44
15
then
shall
it
be
for
a
man
to
burn
for
he
will
take
thereof
and
warm
himself
yea
he
kindleth
it
and
baketh
bread
yea
he
maketh
a
god
and
worshippeth
it
he
maketh
it
a
graven
image
and
falleth
down
thereto
44
16
he
burneth
part
thereof
in
the
fire
with
part
thereof
he
eateth
flesh
he
roasteth
roast
and
is
satisfied
yea
he
warmeth
himself
and
saith
aha
i
am
warm
i
have
seen
the
fire
44
17
and
the
residue
thereof
he
maketh
a
god
even
his
graven
image
he
falleth
down
unto
it
and
worshippeth
it
and
prayeth
unto
it
and
saith
deliver
me
for
thou
art
my
god
44
18
they
have
not
known
nor
understood
for
he
hath
shut
their
eyes
that
they
cannot
see
and
their
hearts
that
they
cannot
understand
44
19
and
none
considereth
in
his
heart
neither
is
there
knowledge
nor
understanding
to
say
i
have
burned
part
of
it
in
the
fire
yea
also
i
have
baked
bread
upon
the
coals
thereof
i
have
roasted
flesh
and
eaten
it
and
shall
i
make
the
residue
thereof
an
abomination
shall
i
fall
down
to
the
stock
of
a
tree
44
20
he
feedeth
on
ashes
a
deceived
heart
hath
turned
him
aside
that
he
cannot
deliver
his
soul
nor
say
is
there
not
a
lie
in
my
right
hand
44
21
remember
these
o
jacob
and
israel
for
thou
art
my
servant
i
have
formed
thee
thou
art
my
servant
o
israel
thou
shalt
not
be
forgotten
of
me
44
22
i
have
blotted
out
as
a
thick
cloud
thy
transgressions
and
as
a
cloud
thy
sins
return
unto
me
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
44
23
sing
o
ye
heavens
for
the
lord
hath
done
it
shout
ye
lower
parts
of
the
earth
break
forth
into
singing
ye
mountains
o
forest
and
every
tree
therein
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
glorified
himself
in
israel
44
24
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
and
he
that
formed
thee
from
the
womb
i
am
the
lord
that
maketh
all
things
that
stretcheth
forth
the
heavens
alone
that
spreadeth
abroad
the
earth
by
myself
44
25
that
frustrateth
the
tokens
of
the
liars
and
maketh
diviners
mad
that
turneth
wise
men
backward
and
maketh
their
knowledge
foolish
44
26
that
confirmeth
the
word
of
his
servant
and
performeth
the
counsel
of
his
messengers
that
saith
to
jerusalem
thou
shalt
be
inhabited
and
to
the
cities
of
judah
ye
shall
be
built
and
i
will
raise
up
the
decayed
places
thereof
44
27
that
saith
to
the
deep
be
dry
and
i
will
dry
up
thy
rivers
44
28
that
saith
of
cyrus
he
is
my
shepherd
and
shall
perform
all
my
pleasure
even
saying
to
jerusalem
thou
shalt
be
built
and
to
the
temple
thy
foundation
shall
be
laid
45
1
thus
saith
the
lord
to
his
anointed
to
cyrus
whose
right
hand
i
have
holden
to
subdue
nations
before
him
and
i
will
loose
the
loins
of
kings
to
open
before
him
the
two
leaved
gates
and
the
gates
shall
not
be
shut
45
2
i
will
go
before
thee
and
make
the
crooked
places
straight
i
will
break
in
pieces
the
gates
of
brass
and
cut
in
sunder
the
bars
of
iron
45
3
and
i
will
give
thee
the
treasures
of
darkness
and
hidden
riches
of
secret
places
that
thou
mayest
know
that
i
the
lord
which
call
thee
by
thy
name
am
the
god
of
israel
45
4
for
jacob
my
servant’s
sake
and
israel
mine
elect
i
have
even
called
thee
by
thy
name
i
have
surnamed
thee
though
thou
hast
not
known
me
45
5
i
am
the
lord
and
there
is
none
else
there
is
no
god
beside
me
i
girded
thee
though
thou
hast
not
known
me
45
6
that
they
may
know
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
from
the
west
that
there
is
none
beside
me
i
am
the
lord
and
there
is
none
else
45
7
i
form
the
light
and
create
darkness
i

drop
down
ye
heavens
from

and
let
the
skies
pour
down

let

earth
open
and
let
them
bring

i

woe
unto
him
that
striveth
with
his
maker
let
the
potsherd
strive
with
the
potsherds
of
the
earth
shall
the
clay
say
to
him
that
fashioneth
it
what
makest
thou
or

work
he
hath
no

45
10
woe
unto
him
that
saith
unto
his
father
what
begettest
thou
or
to
the
woman
what
hast
thou
brought
forth
45
11
thus
saith
the
lord
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
his
maker
ask
me
of
things
to
come
concerning
my
sons
and
concerning
the
work
of
my
hands
command
ye
me
45
12
i
have
made
the
earth
and
created
man
upon
it
i
even
my
hands
have
stretched
out
the
heavens
and
all
their
host
have
i
commanded
45
13
i
have
raised
him
up
in
righteousness
and
i
will
direct
all
his
ways
he
shall
build
my
city
and
he
shall
let
go
my
captives
not
for
price
nor
reward
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
45
14
thus
saith
the
lord
the
labour
of
egypt
and
merchandise
of
ethiopia
and
of
the
sabeans
men
of
stature
shall
come
over
unto
thee
and
they
shall
be
thine
they
shall
come
after
thee
in
chains
they
shall
come
over
and
they
shall
fall
down
unto
thee
they
shall
make
supplication
unto
thee
saying
surely
god
is
in
thee
and
there
is
none
else
there
is
no
god
45
15
verily
thou
art
a
god
that
hidest
thyself
o
god
of
israel
the
saviour
45
16
they
shall
be
ashamed
and
also
confounded
all
of
them
they
shall
go
to
confusion
together
that
are
makers
of
idols
45
17
but
israel
shall
be
saved
in
the
lord
with
an
everlasting
salvation
ye
shall
not
be
ashamed
nor
confounded
world
without
end
45
18
for
thus
saith
the
lord
that
created
the
heavens
god
himself
that
formed
the
earth
and
made
it
he
hath
established
it
he
created
it
not
in
vain
he
formed
it
to
be
inhabited
i
am
the
lord
and
there
is
none
else
45
19
i
have
not
spoken
in
secret
in
a
dark
place
of
the
earth
i
said
not
unto
the
seed
of
jacob
seek
ye
me
in

declaring
the
end
from
the

and
from
ancient
times
the
things
that

47
1
come
down
and
sit
in
the
dust
o
virgin
daughter
of
babylon
sit
on
the
ground
there
is
no
throne
o
daughter
of
the
chaldeans
for
thou
shalt
no
more
be
called
tender
and
delicate
47
2
take
the
millstones
and
grind
meal
uncover
thy
locks
make
bare
the
leg
uncover
the
thigh
pass
over
the
rivers
47
3
thy
nakedness
shall
be
uncovered
yea
thy
shame
shall
be
seen
i
will
take
vengeance
and
i
will
not
meet
thee
as
a
man
47
4
as
for
our
redeemer
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
the
holy
one
of
israel
47
5
sit
thou
silent
and
get
thee
into
darkness
o
daughter
of
the
chaldeans
for
thou
shalt
no
more
be
called
the
lady
of
kingdoms
47
6
i
was
wroth
with
my
people
i
have
polluted
mine
inheritance
and
given
them
into
thine
hand
thou
didst
shew
them
no
mercy
upon
the
ancient
hast
thou
very
heavily
laid
thy
yoke
47
7
and
thou
saidst
i
shall
be
a
lady
for
ever
so
that
thou
didst
not
lay
these
things
to
thy
heart
neither
didst
remember
the
latter
end
of
it
47
8
therefore
hear
now
this
thou
that
art
given
to
pleasures
that
dwellest
carelessly
that
sayest
in
thine
heart
i
am
and
none
else
beside
me
i
shall
not
sit
as
a
widow
neither
shall
i
know
the
loss
of
children
47
9
but
these
two
things
shall
come
to
thee
in
a
moment
in
one
day
the
loss
of
children
and
widowhood
they
shall
come
upon
thee
in
their
perfection
for
the
multitude
of
thy
sorceries
and
for
the
great
abundance
of
thine
enchantments
47
10
for
thou
hast
trusted
in
thy
wickedness
thou
hast
said
none
seeth
me
thy
wisdom
and
thy
knowledge
it
hath
perverted
thee
and
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart
i
am
and
none
else
beside
me
47
11
therefore
shall
evil
come
upon
thee
thou
shalt
not
know
from
whence
it
riseth
and
mischief
shall
fall
upon
thee
thou
shalt
not
be
able
to
put
it
off
and
desolation
shall
come
upon
thee
suddenly
which
thou
shalt
not
know
47
12
stand
now
with
thine
enchantments
and
with
the
multitude
of
thy
sorceries
wherein
thou
hast
laboured
from
thy
youth
if
so
be
thou
shalt
be
able
to
profit
if
so
be
thou
mayest
prevail
47
13
thou
art
wearied
in
the
multitude
of
thy
counsels
let
now
the
astrologers
the
stargazers
the
monthly
prognosticators
stand
up
and
save
thee
from
these
things
that
shall
come
upon
thee
47
14
behold
they
shall
be
as
stubble
the
fire
shall
burn
them
they
shall
not
deliver
themselves
from
the
power
of
the
flame
there
shall
not
be
a
coal
to
warm
at
nor
fire
to
sit
before
it
47
15
thus
shall
they
be
unto
thee
with
whom
thou
hast
laboured
even
thy
merchants
from
thy
youth
they
shall
wander
every
one
to
his
quarter
none
shall
save
thee
48
1
hear
ye
this
o
house
of
jacob
which
are
called
by
the
name
of
israel
and
are
come
forth
out
of
the
waters
of
judah
which
swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
and
make
mention
of
the
god
of
israel
but
not
in
truth
nor
in
righteousness
48
2
for
they
call
themselves
of
the
holy
city
and
stay
themselves
upon
the
god
of
israel
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
48
3
i
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
i
shewed
them
i
did
them
suddenly
and
they
came
to
pass
48
4
because
i
knew
that
thou
art
obstinate
and
thy
neck
is
an
iron
sinew
and
thy
brow
brass
48
5
i
have
even
from
the
beginning
declared
it
to
thee
before
it
came
to
pass
i
shewed
it
thee
lest
thou
shouldest
say
mine
idol
hath
done
them
and
my
graven
image
and
my
molten
image
hath
commanded
them
48
6
thou
hast
heard
see
all
this
and
will
not
ye
declare
it
i
have
shewed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
even
hidden
things
and
thou
didst
not
know
them
48
7
they
are
created
now
and
not
from
the
beginning
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
lest
thou
shouldest
say
behold
i
knew
them
48
8
yea
thou
heardest
not
yea
thou
knewest
not
yea
from
that
time
that
thine
ear
was
not
opened
for
i
knew
that
thou
wouldest
deal
very
treacherously
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb
48
9
for
my
name’s
sake
will
i
defer
mine
anger
and
for
my
praise
will
i
refrain
for
thee
that
i
cut
thee
not
off
48
10
behold
i
have
refined
thee
but
not
with
silver
i
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
48
11
for
mine
own
sake
even
for
mine
own
sake
will
i
do
it
for
how
should
my
name
be
polluted
and
i
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another
48
12
hearken
unto
me
o
jacob
and
israel
my
called
i
am
he
i
am
the
first
i
also
am
the
last
48
13
mine
hand
also
hath
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
my
right
hand
hath
spanned
the
heavens
when
i
call
unto
them
they
stand
up
together
48
14
all
ye
assemble
yourselves
and
hear
which
among
them
hath
declared
these
things
the
lord
hath
loved
him
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
babylon
and
his
arm
shall
be
on
the
chaldeans
48
15
i
even
i
have
spoken
yea
i
have
called
him
i
have
brought
him
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous
48
16
come
ye
near
unto
me
hear
ye
this
i
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from
the
beginning
from
the
time
that
it
was
there
am
i
and
now
the
lord
god
and
his
spirit
hath
sent
me
48
17
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
teacheth
thee
to
profit
which
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
that
thou
shouldest
go
48
18
o
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandments
then
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
48
19
thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
and
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me
48
20
go
ye
forth
of
babylon
flee
ye
from
the
chaldeans
with
a
voice
of
singing
declare
ye
tell
this
utter
it
even
to
the
end
of
the
earth
say
ye
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
jacob
48
21
and
they
thirsted
not
when
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
he
clave
the
rock
also
and
the
waters
gushed
out
48
22
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
unto
the
wicked
49
1
listen
o
isles
unto
me
and
hearken
ye
people
from
far
the
lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name
49
2
and
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me
49
3
and
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
servant
o
israel
in
whom
i
will
be
glorified
49
4
then
i
said
i
have
laboured
in
vain
i
have
spent
my
strength
for
nought
and
in
vain
yet
surely
my
judgment
is
with
the
lord
and
my
work
with
my
god
49
5
and
now
saith
the
lord
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
to
be
his
servant
to
bring
jacob
again
to
him
though
israel
be
not
gathered
yet
shall
i
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
my
god
shall
be
my
strength
49
6
and
he
said
it
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldest
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
jacob
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
israel
i
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
gentiles
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
end
of
the
earth
49
7
thus
saith
the
lord
the
redeemer
of
israel
and
his
holy
one
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth
to
a
servant
of
rulers
kings
shall
see
and
arise
princes
also
shall
worship
because
of
the
lord
that
is
faithful
and
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
he
shall
choose
thee
49
8
thus
saith
the
lord
in
an
acceptable
time
have
i
heard
thee
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
have
i
helped
thee
and
i
will
preserve
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
to
establish
the
earth
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages
49
9
that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
go
forth
to
them
that
are
in
darkness
shew
yourselves
they
shall
feed
in
the
ways
and
their
pastures
shall
be
in
all
high
places
49
10
they
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
sun
smite
them
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them
49
11
and
i
will
make
all
my
mountains
a
way
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted
49
12
behold
these
shall
come
from
far
and
lo
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
and
these
from
the
land
of
sinim

sing
o

and
be
joyful
o
earth
and
break
forth
into
singing
o
mountains
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted
49
14
but
zion
said
the
lord
hath
forsaken
me
and
my
lord
hath
forgotten
me
49
15
can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
yea
they
may
forget
yet
will
i
not
forget
thee
49
16
behold
i
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
49
17
thy
children
shall
make
haste
thy
destroyers
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
shall
go
forth
of
thee
49
18
lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
behold
all
these
gather
themselves
together
and
come
to
thee
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
as
with
an
ornament
and
bind
them
on
thee
as
a
bride
doeth
49
19
for
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
shall
be
far
away
49
20
the
children
which
thou
shalt
have
after
thou
hast
lost
the
other
shall
say
again
in
thine
ears
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
give
place
to
me
that
i
may
dwell
49
21
then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
seeing
i
have
lost
my
children
and
am
desolate
a
captive
and
removing
to
and
fro
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
behold
i
was
left
alone
these
where
had
they
been
49
22
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
49
23
and
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
toward
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
49
24
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
lawful
captive
delivered
49
25
but
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
for
i
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee
and
i
will
save
thy
children
49
26
and
i
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
as
with
sweet
wine
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
am
thy
saviour
and
thy
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
jacob

thus
saith
the
lord
where
is
the
bill
of
your
mother’s
divorcement
whom
i
have
put
away
or
which
of
my
creditors
is
it
to
whom
i
have
sold
you
behold
for
your
iniquities
have
ye
sold
yourselves
and
for
your
transgressions
is
your
mother
put
away
50

wherefore
when
i
came
was
there
no
man
when
i
called
was
there
none
to
answer
is
my
hand
shortened
at
all
that
it
cannot
redeem
or
have
i
no
power
to
deliver
behold
at
my
rebuke
i
dry
up
the
sea
i
make
the
rivers
a
wilderness
their
fish
stinketh
because
there
is
no
water
and
dieth
for
thirst
50
3
i
clothe
the
heavens
with
blackness
and
i
make
sackcloth
their
covering
50

the
lord
god
hath
given
me
the
tongue
of
the
learned
that
i
should
know
how
to
speak
a
word
in

him

wakeneth
mine
ear

the
lord
god
hath
opened
mine
ear
and
i
was
not
rebellious
neither
turned
away
back
50
6
i
gave
my
back
to
the
smiters
and
my
cheeks
to
them
that
plucked
off
the
hair
i
hid
not
my
face
from
shame
and
spitting
50

for
the
lord
god
will
help
me
therefore
shall
i
not
be
confounded
therefore
have
i
set
my
face
like
a
flint
and

know
that
i
shall
not
be
ashamed

justifieth
me
who

with
me

us
stand
together

mine
adversary

him
come

to
me
50

help
me
who
is
he
that
shall
condemn
me
lo
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
a
garment
the
moth

eat
them
up

among
you
that
feareth
the
lord
that
obeyeth
the
voice
of
his

that
walketh
in

that
compass
yourselves
about
with
sparks
walk
in
the
light
of
your
fire
and
in

hearken
to
me
ye
that
follow
after

ye
that

look
unto
the
rock
whence
ye
are
hewn
and

look
unto
abraham
your
father
and
unto
sarah
that
bare
you
for

called
him
alone
and
blessed
him
and

for
the

comfort
zion
he
will
comfort
all
her
waste
places
and
he
will
make
her
wilderness
like
eden
and
her

thanksgiving

hearken
unto
me
my
people
and
give
ear
unto
me
o
my
nation
for

proceed
from
me
and
i

my
righteousness
is
near
my
salvation
is
gone
forth

mine
arms

judge
the
people
the

shall
wait
upon
me

on
mine
arm
shall
they
trust
51
6
lift
up
your
eyes
to
the
heavens
and
look
upon
the
earth
beneath
for
the
heavens
shall
vanish
away
like
smoke
and
the
earth
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
and
they
that
dwell
therein
shall
die
in

manner
but
my
salvation

ye
that
know
righteousness
the
people
in

heart
is
my
law
fear
ye
not
the
reproach
of
men
neither

for
the
moth

my
salvation
from
generation

awake
awake
put
on
strength
o
arm
of
the
lord
awake
as
in
the
ancient
days
in
the
generations
of
old
art
thou
not
it
that
hath
cut
rahab
and
wounded
the
dragon
51
10
art
thou
not
it
which
hath
dried
the
sea
the
waters
of
the
great
deep
that
hath
made
the
depths
of
the
sea
a
way
for
the
ransomed
to
pass
over
51
11
therefore
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
with
singing
unto
zion
and
everlasting
joy
shall
be
upon
their
head
they
shall
obtain
gladness
and
joy
and
sorrow
and
mourning
shall
flee
away
51
12
i
even
i
am
he
that
comforteth
you
who
art
thou
that
thou
shouldest
be
afraid
of
a
man
that
shall
die
and
of
the
son
of
man
which
shall
be
made
as
grass
51
13
and
forgettest
the
lord
thy
maker
that
hath
stretched
forth
the
heavens
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
and
hast
feared
continually
every
day
because
of
the
fury
of
the
oppressor
as
if
he
were
ready
to
destroy
and
where
is
the
fury
of
the
oppressor
51
14
the
captive
exile
hasteneth
that
he
may
be
loosed
and
that
he
should
not
die
in
the
pit
nor
that
his
bread
should
fail
51
15
but
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
that
divided
the
sea
whose
waves
roared
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
51
16
and
i
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth
and
i
have
covered
thee
in
the
shadow
of
mine
hand
that
i
may
plant
the
heavens
and
lay
the
foundations
of
the
earth
and
say
unto
zion
thou
art
my
people
51
17
awake
awake
stand
up
o
jerusalem
which
hast
drunk
at
the
hand
of
the
lord
the
cup
of
his
fury
thou
hast
drunken
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
trembling
and
wrung
them
out
51
18
there
is
none
to
guide
her
among
all
the
sons
whom
she
hath
brought
forth
neither
is
there
any
that
taketh
her
by
the
hand
of
all
the
sons
that
she
hath
brought
up
51
19
these
two
things
are
come
unto
thee
who
shall
be
sorry
for
thee
desolation
and
destruction
and
the
famine
and
the
sword
by
whom
shall
i
comfort
thee
51
20
thy
sons
have
fainted
they
lie
at
the
head
of
all
the
streets
as
a
wild
bull
in
a
net
they
are
full
of
the
fury
of
the
lord
the
rebuke
of
thy
god
51
21
therefore
hear
now
this
thou
afflicted
and
drunken
but
not
with
wine
51
22
thus
saith
thy
lord
the
lord
and
thy
god
that
pleadeth
the
cause
of
his
people
behold
i
have
taken
out
of
thine
hand
the
cup
of
trembling
even
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
my
fury
thou
shalt
no
more
drink
it
again
51
23
but
i
will
put
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
afflict
thee
which
have
said
to
thy
soul
bow
down
that
we
may
go
over
and
thou
hast
laid
thy
body
as
the
ground
and
as
the
street
to
them
that
went
over
52
1
awake
awake
put
on
thy
strength
o
zion
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
o
jerusalem
the
holy
city
for
henceforth
there
shall
no
more
come
into
thee
the
uncircumcised
and
the
unclean
52
2
shake
thyself
from
the
dust
arise
and
sit
down
o
jerusalem
loose
thyself
from
the
bands
of
thy
neck
o
captive
daughter
of
zion
52
3
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
sold
yourselves
for
nought
and
ye
shall
be
redeemed
without
money
52
4
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
my
people
went
down
aforetime
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
and
the
assyrian
oppressed
them
without
cause
52
5
now
therefore
what
have
i
here
saith
the
lord
that
my
people
is
taken
away
for
nought
they
that
rule
over
them
make
them
to
howl
saith
the
lord
and
my
name
continually
every
day
is
blasphemed
52
6
therefore
my
people
shall
know
my
name
therefore
they
shall
know
in
that
day
that
i
am
he
that
doth
speak
behold
it
is
i
52
7
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
publisheth
peace
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good
that
publisheth
salvation
that
saith
unto
zion
thy
god
reigneth
52
8
thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
when
the
lord
shall
bring
again
zion
52
9
break
forth
into
joy
sing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem
52
10
the
lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
god
52
11
depart
ye
depart
ye
go
ye
out
from
thence
touch
no
unclean
thing
go
ye
out
of
the
midst
of
her
be
ye
clean
that
bear
the
vessels
of
the
lord
52
12
for
ye
shall
not
go
out
with
haste
nor
go
by
flight
for
the
lord
will
go
before
you
and
the
god
of
israel
will
be
your
rereward
52
13
behold
my
servant
shall
deal
prudently
he
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled
and
be
very
high
52
14
as
many
were
astonied
at
thee
his
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of
men
52
15
so
shall
he
sprinkle
many
nations
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him
for
that
which
had
not
been
told
them
shall
they
see
and
that
which
they
had
not
heard
shall
they
consider
53
1
who
hath
believed
our
report
and
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
lord
revealed
53
2
for
he
shall
grow
up
before
him
as
a
tender
plant
and
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
and
when
we
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
53
3
he
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
he
was
despised
and
we
esteemed
him
not
53
4
surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
smitten
of
god
and
afflicted
53
5
but
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
53
6
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
53
7
he
was
oppressed
and
he
was
afflicted
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
53
8
he
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
stricken
53
9
and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
in
his
death
because
he
had
done
no
violence
neither
was
any
deceit
in
his
mouth
53
10
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
he
hath
put
him
to
grief
when
thou
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offering
for
sin
he
shall
see
his
seed
he
shall
prolong
his
days
and
the
pleasure
of
the
lord
shall
prosper
in
his
hand
53
11
he
shall
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
shall
be
satisfied
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
for
he
shall
bear
their
iniquities
53
12
therefore
will
i
divide
him
a
portion
with
the
great
and
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong
because
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
and
he
bare
the
sin
of
many
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
54
1
sing
o
barren
thou
that
didst
not
bear
break
forth
into
singing
and
cry
aloud
thou
that
didst
not
travail
with
child
for
more
are
the
children
of
the
desolate
than
the
children
of
the
married
wife
saith
the
lord
54
2
enlarge
the
place
of
thy
tent
and
let
them
stretch
forth
the
curtains
of
thine
habitations
spare
not
lengthen
thy
cords
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
54
3
for
thou
shalt
break
forth
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
and
thy
seed
shall
inherit
the
gentiles
and
make
the
desolate
cities
to
be
inhabited
54
4
fear
not
for
thou
shalt
not
be
ashamed
neither
be
thou
confounded
for
thou
shalt
not
be
put
to
shame
for
thou
shalt
forget
the
shame
of
thy
youth
and
shalt
not
remember
the
reproach
of
thy
widowhood
any
more
54
5
for
thy
maker
is
thine
husband
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
and
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
shall
he
be
called
54
6
for
the
lord
hath
called
thee
as
a
woman
forsaken
and
grieved
in
spirit
and
a
wife
of
youth
when
thou
wast
refused
saith
thy
god
54
7
for
a
small
moment
have
i
forsaken
thee
but
with
great
mercies
will
i
gather
thee
54
8
in
a
little
wrath
i
hid
my
face
from
thee
for
a
moment
but
with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
on
thee
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
54
9
for
this
is
as
the
waters
of
noah
unto
me
for
as
i
have
sworn
that
the
waters
of
noah
should
no
more
go
over
the
earth
so
have
i
sworn
that
i
would
not
be
wroth
with
thee
nor
rebuke
thee
54
10
for
the
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
removed
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed
saith
the
lord
that
hath
mercy
on
thee
54
11
o
thou
afflicted
tossed
with
tempest
and
not
comforted
behold
i
will
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colours
and
lay
thy
foundations
with
sapphires
54
12
and
i
will
make
thy
windows
of
agates
and
thy
gates
of
carbuncles
and
all
thy
borders
of
pleasant
stones
54
13
and
all
thy
children
shall
be
taught
of
the
lord
and
great
shall
be
the
peace
of
thy
children
54
14
in
righteousness
shalt
thou
be
established
thou
shalt
be
far
from
oppression
for
thou
shalt
not
fear
and
from
terror
for
it
shall
not
come
near
thee
54
15
behold
they
shall
surely
gather
together
but
not
by
me
whosoever
shall
gather
together
against
thee
shall
fall
for
thy
sake
54
16
behold
i
have
created
the
smith
that
bloweth
the
coals
in
the
fire
and
that
bringeth
forth
an
instrument
for
his
work
and
i
have
created
the
waster
to
destroy
54
17
no
weapon
that
is
formed
against
thee
shall
prosper
and
every
tongue
that
shall
rise
against
thee
in
judgment
thou
shalt
condemn
this
is
the
heritage
of
the
servants
of
the
lord
and
their
righteousness
is
of
me
saith
the
lord
55
1
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
waters
and
he
that
hath
no
money
come
ye
buy
and
eat
yea
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price
55
2
wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
your
labour
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
hearken
diligently
unto
me
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
fatness
55
3
incline
your
ear
and
come
unto
me
hear
and
your
soul
shall
live
and
i
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
you
even
the
sure
mercies
of
david
55
4
behold
i
have
given
him
for
a
witness
to
the
people
a
leader
and
commander
to
the
people
55
5
behold
thou
shalt
call
a
nation
that
thou
knowest
not
and
nations
that
knew
not
thee
shall
run
unto
thee
because
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
for
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
he
hath
glorified
thee
55
6
seek
ye
the
lord
while
he
may
be
found
call
ye
upon
him
while
he
is
near
55
7
let
the
wicked
forsake
his
way
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts
and
let
him
return
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
him
and
to
our
god
for
he
will
abundantly
pardon
55
8
for
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
neither
are
your
ways
my
ways
saith
the
lord
55
9
for
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
so
are
my
ways
higher
than
your
ways
and
my
thoughts
than
your
thoughts
55
10
for
as
the
rain
cometh
down
and
the
snow
from
heaven
and
returneth
not
thither
but
watereth
the
earth
and
maketh
it
bring
forth
and
bud
that
it
may
give
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
to
the
eater
55
11
so
shall
my
word
be
that
goeth
forth
out
of
my
mouth
it
shall
not
return
unto
me
void
but
it
shall
accomplish
that
which
i
please
and
it
shall
prosper
in
the
thing
whereto
i
sent
it
55
12
for
ye
shall
go
out
with
joy
and
be
led
forth
with
peace
the
mountains
and
the
hills
shall
break
forth
before
you
into
singing
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
clap
their
hands
55
13
instead
of
the
thorn
shall
come
up
the
fir
tree
and
instead
of
the
brier
shall
come
up
the
myrtle
tree
and
it
shall
be
to
the
lord
for
a
name
for
an
everlasting
sign
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
56
1
thus
saith
the
lord
keep
ye
judgment
and
do
justice
for
my
salvation
is
near
to
come
and
my
righteousness
to
be
revealed
56
2
blessed
is
the
man
that
doeth
this
and
the
son
of
man
that
layeth
hold
on
it
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
keepeth
his
hand
from
doing
any
evil
56
3
neither
let
the
son
of
the
stranger
that
hath
joined
himself
to
the
lord
speak
saying
the
lord
hath
utterly
separated
me
from
his
people
neither
let
the
eunuch
say
behold
i
am
a
dry
tree
56
4
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
eunuchs
that
keep
my
sabbaths
and
choose
the
things
that
please
me
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant
56
5
even
unto
them
will
i
give
in
mine
house
and
within
my
walls
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
of
sons
and
of
daughters
i
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
56
6
also
the
sons
of
the
stranger
that
join
themselves
to
the
lord
to
serve
him
and
to
love
the
name
of
the
lord
to
be
his
servants
every
one
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
taketh
hold
of
my
covenant
56
7
even
them
will
i
bring
to
my
holy
mountain
and
make
them
joyful
in
my
house
of
prayer
their
burnt
offerings
and
their
sacrifices
shall
be
accepted
upon
mine
altar
for
mine
house
shall
be
called
an
house
of
prayer
for
all
people
56
8
the
lord
god
which
gathereth
the
outcasts
of
israel
saith
yet
will
i
gather
others
to
him
beside
those
that
are
gathered
unto
him
56
9
all
ye
beasts
of
the
field
come
to
devour
yea
all
ye
beasts
in
the
forest
56
10
his
watchmen
are
blind
they
are
all
ignorant
they
are
all
dumb
dogs
they
cannot
bark
sleeping
lying
down
loving
to
slumber
56
11
yea
they
are
greedy
dogs
which
can
never
have
enough
and
they
are
shepherds
that
cannot
understand
they
all
look
to
their
own
way
every
one
for
his
gain
from
his
quarter
56
12
come
ye
say
they
i
will
fetch
wine
and
we
will
fill
ourselves
with
strong
drink
and
to
morrow
shall
be
as
this
day
and
much
more
abundant
57
1
the
righteous
perisheth
and
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart
and
merciful
men
are
taken
away
none
considering
that
the
righteous
is
taken
away
from
the
evil
to
come
57
2
he
shall
enter
into
peace
they
shall
rest
in
their
beds
each
one
walking
in
his
uprightness
57
3
but
draw
near
hither
ye
sons
of
the
sorceress
the
seed
of
the
adulterer
and
the
whore
57
4
against
whom
do
ye
sport
yourselves
against
whom
make
ye
a
wide
mouth
and
draw
out
the
tongue
are
ye
not
children
of
transgression
a
seed
of
falsehood
57
5
enflaming
yourselves
with
idols
under
every
green
tree
slaying
the
children
in
the
valleys
under
the
clifts
of
the
rocks
57
6
among
the
smooth
stones
of
the
stream
is
thy
portion
they
they
are
thy
lot
even
to
them
hast
thou
poured
a
drink
offering
thou
hast
offered
a
meat
offering
should
i
receive
comfort
in
these
57
7
upon
a
lofty
and
high
mountain
hast
thou
set
thy
bed
even
thither
wentest
thou
up
to
offer
sacrifice
57
8
behind
the
doors
also
and
the
posts
hast
thou
set
up
thy
remembrance
for
thou
hast
discovered
thyself
to
another
than
me
and
art
gone
up
thou
hast
enlarged
thy
bed
and
made
thee
a
covenant
with
them
thou
lovedst
their
bed
where
thou
sawest
it
57
9
and
thou
wentest
to
the
king
with
ointment
and
didst
increase
thy
perfumes
and
didst
send
thy
messengers
far
off
and
didst
debase
thyself
even
unto
hell
57
10
thou
art
wearied
in
the
greatness
of
thy
way
yet
saidst
thou
not
there
is
no
hope
thou
hast
found
the
life
of
thine
hand
therefore
thou
wast
not
grieved
57
11
and
of
whom
hast
thou
been
afraid
or
feared
that
thou
hast
lied
and
hast
not
remembered
me
nor
laid
it
to
thy
heart
have
not
i
held
my
peace
even
of
old
and
thou
fearest
me
not
57
12
i
will
declare
thy
righteousness
and
thy
works
for
they
shall
not
profit
thee
57
13
when
thou
criest
let
thy
companies
deliver
thee
but
the
wind
shall
carry
them
all
away
vanity
shall
take
them
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
me
shall
possess
the
land
and
shall
inherit
my
holy
mountain
57
14
and
shall
say
cast
ye
up
cast
ye
up
prepare
the
way
take
up
the
stumblingblock
out
of
the
way
of
my
people
57
15
for
thus
saith
the
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
whose
name
is
holy
i
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place
with
him
also
that
is
of
a
contrite
and
humble
spirit
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
ones
57
16
for
i
will
not
contend
for
ever
neither
will
i
be
always
wroth
for
the
spirit
should
fail
before
me
and
the
souls
which
i
have
made
57
17
for
the
iniquity
of
his
covetousness
was
i
wroth
and
smote
him
i
hid
me
and
was
wroth
and
he
went
on
frowardly
in
the
way
of
his
heart
57
18
i
have
seen
his
ways
and
will
heal
him
i
will
lead
him
also
and
restore
comforts
unto
him
and
to
his
mourners
57
19
i
create
the
fruit
of
the
lips
peace
peace
to
him
that
is
far
off
and
to
him
that
is
near
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
heal
him
57
20
but
the
wicked
are
like
the
troubled
sea
when
it
cannot
rest
whose
waters
cast
up
mire
and
dirt
57
21
there
is
no
peace
saith
my
god
to
the
wicked
58
1
cry
aloud
spare
not
lift
up
thy
voice
like
a
trumpet
and
shew
my
people
their
transgression
and
the
house
of
jacob
their
sins
58
2
yet
they
seek
me
daily
and
delight
to
know
my
ways
as
a
nation
that
did
righteousness
and
forsook
not
the
ordinance
of
their
god
they
ask
of
me
the
ordinances
of
justice
they
take
delight
in
approaching
to
god
58
3
wherefore
have
we
fasted
say
they
and
thou
seest
not
wherefore
have
we
afflicted
our
soul
and
thou
takest
no
knowledge
behold
in
the
day
of
your
fast
ye
find
pleasure
and
exact
all
your
labours
58
4
behold
ye
fast
for
strife
and
debate
and
to
smite
with
the
fist
of
wickedness
ye
shall
not
fast
as
ye
do
this
day
to
make
your
voice
to
be
heard
on
high
58
5
is
it
such
a
fast
that
i
have
chosen
a
day
for
a
man
to
afflict
his
soul
is
it
to
bow
down
his
head
as
a
bulrush
and
to
spread
sackcloth
and
ashes
under
him
wilt
thou
call
this
a
fast
and
an
acceptable
day
to
the
lord
58
6
is
not
this
the
fast
that
i
have
chosen
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
that
ye
break
every
yoke
58
7
is
it
not
to
deal
thy
bread
to
the
hungry
and
that
thou
bring
the
poor
that
are
cast
out
to
thy
house
when
thou
seest
the
naked
that
thou
cover
him
and
that
thou
hide
not
thyself
from
thine
own
flesh
58
8
then
shall
thy
light
break
forth
as
the
morning
and
thine
health
shall
spring
forth
speedily
and
thy
righteousness
shall
go
before
thee
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
thy
rereward
58
9
then
shalt
thou
call
and
the
lord
shall
answer
thou
shalt
cry
and
he
shall
say
here
i
am
if
thou
take
away
from
the
midst
of
thee
the
yoke
the
putting
forth
of
the
finger
and
speaking
vanity
58
10
and
if
thou
draw
out
thy
soul
to
the
hungry
and
satisfy
the
afflicted
soul
then
shall
thy
light
rise
in
obscurity
and
thy
darkness
be
as
the
noon
day
58
11
and
the
lord
shall
guide
thee
continually
and
satisfy
thy
soul
in
drought
and
make
fat
thy
bones
and
thou
shalt
be
like
a
watered
garden
and
like
a
spring
of
water
whose
waters
fail
not
58
12
and
they
that
shall
be
of
thee
shall
build
the
old
waste
places
thou
shalt
raise
up
the
foundations
of
many
generations
and
thou
shalt
be
called
the
repairer
of
the
breach
the
restorer
of
paths
to
dwell
in
58
13
if
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
the
sabbath
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight
the
holy
of
the
lord
honourable
and
shalt
honour
him
not
doing
thine
own
ways
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure
nor
speaking
thine
own
words
58
14
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
ride
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
and
feed
thee
with
the
heritage
of
jacob
thy
father
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
59
1
behold
the
lord’s
hand
is
not
shortened
that
it
cannot
save
neither
his
ear
heavy
that
it
cannot
hear
59
2
but
your
iniquities
have
separated
between
you
and
your
god
and
your
sins
have
hid
his
face
from
you
that
he
will
not
hear
59
3
for
your
hands
are
defiled
with
blood
and
your
fingers
with
iniquity
your
lips
have
spoken
lies
your
tongue
hath
muttered
perverseness
59
4
none
calleth
for
justice
nor
any
pleadeth
for
truth
they
trust
in
vanity
and
speak
lies
they
conceive
mischief
and
bring
forth
iniquity
59
5
they
hatch
cockatrice’
eggs
and
weave
the
spider’s
web
he
that
eateth
of
their
eggs
dieth
and
that
which
is
crushed
breaketh
out
into
a
viper
59
6
their
webs
shall
not
become
garments
neither
shall
they
cover
themselves
with
their
works
their
works
are
works
of
iniquity
and
the
act
of
violence
is
in
their
hands
59
7
their
feet
run
to
evil
and
they
make
haste
to
shed
innocent
blood
their
thoughts
are
thoughts
of
iniquity
wasting
and
destruction
are
in
their
paths
59
8
the
way
of
peace
they
know
not
and
there
is
no
judgment
in
their
goings
they
have
made
them
crooked
paths
whosoever
goeth
therein
shall
not
know
peace
59
9
therefore
is
judgment
far
from
us
neither
doth
justice
overtake
us
we
wait
for
light
but
behold
obscurity
for
brightness
but
we
walk
in
darkness
59
10
we
grope
for
the
wall
like
the
blind
and
we
grope
as
if
we
had
no
eyes
we
stumble
at
noon
day
as
in
the
night
we
are
in
desolate
places
as
dead
men
59
11
we
roar
all
like
bears
and
mourn
sore
like
doves
we
look
for
judgment
but
there
is
none
for
salvation
but
it
is
far
off
from
us
59
12
for
our
transgressions
are
multiplied
before
thee
and
our
sins
testify
against
us
for
our
transgressions
are
with
us
and
as
for
our
iniquities
we
know
them
59
13
in
transgressing
and
lying
against
the
lord
and
departing
away
from
our
god
speaking
oppression
and
revolt
conceiving
and
uttering
from
the
heart
words
of
falsehood
59
14
and
judgment
is
turned
away
backward
and
justice
standeth
afar
off
for
truth
is
fallen
in
the
street
and
equity
cannot
enter
59
15
yea
truth
faileth
and
he
that
departeth
from
evil
maketh
himself
a
prey
and
the
lord
saw
it
and
it
displeased
him
that
there
was
no
judgment
59
16
and
he
saw
that
there
was
no
man
and
wondered
that
there
was
no
intercessor
therefore
his
arm
brought
salvation
unto
him
and
his
righteousness
it
sustained
him
59
17
for
he
put
on
righteousness
as
a
breastplate
and
an
helmet
of
salvation
upon
his
head
and
he
put
on
the
garments
of
vengeance
for
clothing
and
was
clad
with
zeal
as
a
cloak
59
18
according
to
their
deeds
accordingly
he
will
repay
fury
to
his
adversaries
recompence
to
his
enemies
to
the
islands
he
will
repay
recompence
59
19
so
shall
they
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
from
the
west
and
his
glory
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
the
enemy
shall
come
in
like
a
flood
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
lift
up
a
standard
against
him
59
20
and
the
redeemer
shall
come
to
zion
and
unto
them
that
turn
from
transgression
in
jacob
saith
the
lord
59
21
as
for
me
this
is
my
covenant
with
them
saith
the
lord
my
spirit
that
is
upon
thee
and
my
words
which
i
have
put
in
thy
mouth
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed’s
seed
saith
the
lord
from
henceforth
and
for
ever
60
1
arise
shine
for
thy
light
is
come
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
is
risen
upon
thee
60
2
for
behold
the
darkness
shall
cover
the
earth
and
gross
darkness
the
people
but
the
lord
shall
arise
upon
thee
and
his
glory
shall
be
seen
upon
thee
60
3
and
the
gentiles
shall
come
to
thy
light
and
kings
to
the
brightness
of
thy
rising
60
4
lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
see
all
they
gather
themselves
together
they
come
to
thee
thy
sons
shall
come
from
far
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
nursed
at
thy
side
60
5
then
thou
shalt
see
and
flow
together
and
thine
heart
shall
fear
and
be
enlarged
because
the
abundance
of
the
sea
shall
be
converted
unto
thee
the
forces
of
the
gentiles
shall
come
unto
thee
60
6
the
multitude
of
camels
shall
cover
thee
the
dromedaries
of
midian
and
ephah
all
they
from
sheba
shall
come
they
shall
bring
gold
and
incense
and
they
shall
shew
forth
the
praises
of
the
lord
60
7
all
the
flocks
of
kedar
shall
be
gathered
together
unto
thee
the
rams
of
nebaioth
shall
minister
unto
thee
they
shall
come
up
with
acceptance
on
mine
altar
and
i
will
glorify
the
house
of
my
glory
60
8
who
are
these
that
fly
as
a
cloud
and
as
the
doves
to
their
windows
60
9
surely
the
isles
shall
wait
for
me
and
the
ships
of
tarshish
first
to
bring
thy
sons
from
far
their
silver
and
their
gold
with
them
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
to
the
holy
one
of
israel
because
he
hath
glorified
thee
60
10
and
the
sons
of
strangers
shall
build
up
thy
walls
and
their
kings
shall
minister
unto
thee
for
in
my
wrath
i
smote
thee
but
in
my
favour
have
i
had
mercy
on
thee
60
11
therefore
thy
gates
shall
be
open
continually
they
shall
not
be
shut
day
nor
night
that
men
may
bring
unto
thee
the
forces
of
the
gentiles
and
that
their
kings
may
be
brought
60
12
for
the
nation
and
kingdom
that
will
not
serve
thee
shall
perish
yea
those
nations
shall
be
utterly
wasted
60
13
the
glory
of
lebanon
shall
come
unto
thee
the
fir
tree
the
pine
tree
and
the
box
together
to
beautify
the
place
of
my
sanctuary
and
i
will
make
the
place
of
my
feet
glorious
60
14
the
sons
also
of
them
that
afflicted
thee
shall
come
bending
unto
thee
and
all
they
that
despised
thee
shall
bow
themselves
down
at
the
soles
of
thy
feet
and
they
shall
call
thee
the
city
of
the
lord
the
zion
of
the
holy
one
of

that

went
through
thee
i
will
make
thee
an
eternal
excellency
a
joy
of
many
generations
60
16
thou
shalt
also
suck
the
milk
of
the
gentiles
and

suck
the
breast
of
kings
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i

the

the

beauty
for

this

i
that

mighty

wherefore
art
thou
red
in
thine
apparel
and
thy
garments
like
him
that
treadeth
in
the
winefat
63
3
i
have
trodden
the
winepress
alone
and
of
the
people
there
was
none
with
me
for
i
will
tread
them
in
mine
anger
and
trample
them
in
my
fury
and
their
blood
shall
be
sprinkled
upon
my
garments
and
i
will
stain
all
my
raiment
63

for
the
day
of
vengeance
is
in
mine
heart
and
the
year
of
my
redeemed
is
come
63
5
and
i
looked
and
there
was
none
to
help
and
i
wondered
that
there
was
none
to
uphold
therefore
mine
own
arm
brought
salvation
unto
me
and
my
fury
it
upheld
me
63
6
and
i
will
tread
down
the
people
in
mine
anger
and
make
them
drunk
in
my
fury
and
i
will
bring
down
their
strength
to
the
earth
63
7
i
will
mention
the
lovingkindnesses
of
the
lord
and
the
praises
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
the
lord
hath
bestowed
on
us
and
the
great
goodness
toward
the
house
of
israel
which
he
hath
bestowed
on
them
according
to
his
mercies
and
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
lovingkindnesses
63
8
for
he
said
surely
they
are
my
people
children
that
will
not
lie
so
he
was
their
saviour
63
9
in
all
their
affliction
he
was
afflicted
and
the
angel
of
his
presence
saved
them
in
his
love
and
in
his
pity
he
redeemed
them
and
he
bare
them
and
carried
them
all
the
days
of
old
63
10
but
they
rebelled
and
vexed
his
holy
spirit
therefore
he
was
turned
to
be
their
enemy
and
he
fought
against
them
63
11
then
he
remembered
the
days
of
old
moses
and
his
people
saying
where
is
he
that
brought
them
up
out
of
the
sea
with
the
shepherd
of
his
flock
where
is
he
that
put
his
holy
spirit
within
him
63
12
that
led
them
by
the
right
hand
of
moses
with
his
glorious
arm
dividing
the
water
before
them
to
make
himself
an
everlasting
name
63
13
that
led
them
through
the
deep
as
an
horse
in
the
wilderness
that
they
should
not
stumble
63
14
as
a
beast
goeth
down
into
the
valley
the
spirit
of
the
lord
caused
him
to
rest
so
didst
thou
lead
thy
people
to
make
thyself
a
glorious
name
63
15
look
down
from
heaven
and
behold
from
the
habitation
of
thy
holiness
and
of
thy
glory
where
is
thy
zeal
and
thy
strength
the
sounding
of
thy
bowels
and
of
thy
mercies
toward
me
are
they
restrained
63
16
doubtless
thou
art
our
father
though
abraham
be
ignorant
of
us
and
israel
acknowledge
us
not
thou
o
lord
art
our
father
our
redeemer
thy
name
is
from
everlasting
63
17
o
lord
why
hast
thou
made
us
to
err
from
thy
ways
and
hardened
our
heart
from
thy
fear
return
for
thy
servants’
sake
the
tribes
of
thine
inheritance
63
18
the
people
of
thy
holiness
have
possessed
it
but
a
little
while
our
adversaries
have
trodden
down
thy
sanctuary
63
19
we
are
thine
thou
never
barest
rule
over
them
they
were
not
called
by
thy
name
64
1
oh
that
thou
wouldest
rend
the
heavens
that
thou
wouldest
come
down
that
the
mountains
might
flow
down
at
thy
presence
64
2
as
when
the
melting
fire
burneth
the
fire
causeth
the
waters
to
boil
to
make
thy
name
known
to
thine
adversaries
that
the
nations
may
tremble
at
thy
presence
64
3
when
thou
didst
terrible
things
which
we
looked
not
for
thou
camest
down
the
mountains
flowed
down
at
thy
presence
64
4
for
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
men
have
not
heard
nor
perceived
by
the
ear
neither
hath
the
eye
seen
o
god
beside
thee
what
he
hath
prepared
for
him
that
waiteth
for
him
64
5
thou
meetest
him
that
rejoiceth
and
worketh
righteousness
those
that
remember
thee
in
thy
ways
behold
thou
art
wroth
for
we
have
sinned
in
those
is
continuance
and
we
shall
be
saved
64
6
but
we
are
all
as
an
unclean
thing
and
all
our
righteousnesses
are
as
filthy
rags
and
we
all
do
fade
as
a
leaf
and
our
iniquities
like
the
wind
have
taken
us
away
64
7
and
there
is
none
that
calleth
upon
thy
name
that
stirreth
up
himself
to
take
hold
of
thee
for
thou
hast
hid
thy
face
from
us
and
hast
consumed
us
because
of
our
iniquities
64
8
but
now
o
lord
thou
art
our
father
we
are
the
clay
and
thou
our
potter
and
we
all
are
the
work
of
thy
hand
64
9
be
not
wroth
very
sore
o
lord
neither
remember
iniquity
for
ever
behold
see
we
beseech
thee
we
are
all
thy
people
64
10
thy
holy
cities
are
a
wilderness
zion
is
a
wilderness
jerusalem
a
desolation
64
11
our
holy
and
our
beautiful
house
where
our
fathers
praised
thee
is
burned
up
with
fire
and
all
our
pleasant
things
are
laid
waste
64
12
wilt
thou
refrain
thyself
for
these
things
o
lord
wilt
thou
hold
thy
peace
and
afflict
us
very
sore
65
1
i
am
sought
of
them
that
asked
not
for
me
i
am
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not
i
said
behold
me
behold
me
unto
a
nation
that
was
not
called
by
my
name
65
2
i
have
spread
out
my
hands
all
the
day
unto
a
rebellious
people
which
walketh
in
a
way
that
was
not
good
after
their
own
thoughts
65
3
a
people
that
provoketh
me
to
anger
continually
to
my
face
that
sacrificeth
in
gardens
and
burneth
incense
upon
altars
of
brick
65
4
which
remain
among
the
graves
and
lodge
in
the
monuments
which
eat
swine’s
flesh
and
broth
of
abominable
things
is
in
their
vessels
65
5
which
say
stand
by
thyself
come
not
near
to
me
for
i
am
holier
than
thou
these
are
a
smoke
in
my
nose
a
fire
that
burneth
all
the
day
65
6
behold
it
is
written
before
me
i
will
not
keep
silence
but
will
recompense
even
recompense
into
their
bosom
65
7
your
iniquities
and
the
iniquities
of
your
fathers
together
saith
the
lord
which
have
burned
incense
upon
the
mountains
and
blasphemed
me
upon
the
hills
therefore
will
i
measure
their
former
work
into
their
bosom
65
8
thus
saith
the
lord
as
the
new
wine
is
found
in
the
cluster
and
one
saith
destroy
it
not
for
a
blessing
is
in
it
so
will
i
do
for
my
servants’
sakes
that
i
may
not
destroy
them
all
65
9
and
i
will
bring
forth
a
seed
out
of
jacob
and
out
of
judah
an
inheritor
of
my
mountains
and
mine
elect
shall
inherit
it
and
my
servants
shall
dwell
there
65
10
and
sharon
shall
be
a
fold
of
flocks
and
the
valley
of
achor
a
place
for
the
herds
to
lie
down
in
for
my
people
that
have
sought
me
65
11
but
ye
are
they
that
forsake
the
lord
that
forget
my
holy
mountain
that
prepare
a
table
for
that
troop
and
that
furnish
the
drink
offering
unto
that
number
65
12
therefore
will
i
number
you
to
the
sword
and
ye
shall
all
bow
down
to
the
slaughter
because
when
i
called
ye
did
not
answer
when
i
spake
ye
did
not
hear
but
did
evil
before
mine
eyes
and
did
choose
that
wherein
i
delighted
not
65
13
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
my
servants
shall
eat
but
ye
shall
be
hungry
behold
my
servants
shall
drink
but
ye
shall
be
thirsty
behold
my
servants
shall
rejoice
but
ye
shall
be
ashamed
65
14
behold
my
servants
shall
sing
for
joy
of
heart
but
ye
shall
cry
for
sorrow
of
heart
and
shall
howl
for
vexation
of
spirit
65
15
and
ye
shall
leave
your
name
for
a
curse
unto
my
chosen
for
the
lord
god
shall
slay
thee
and
call
his
servants
by
another
name
65
16
that
he
who
blesseth
himself
in
the
earth
shall
bless
himself
in
the
god
of
truth
and
he
that
sweareth
in
the
earth
shall
swear
by
the
god
of
truth
because
the
former
troubles
are
forgotten
and
because
they
are
hid
from
mine
eyes
65
17
for
behold
i
create
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
and
the
former
shall
not
be
remembered
nor
come
into
mind
65
18
but
be
ye
glad
and
rejoice
for
ever
in
that
which
i
create
for
behold
i
create
jerusalem
a
rejoicing
and
her
people
a
joy
65
19
and
i
will
rejoice
in
jerusalem
and
joy
in
my
people
and
the
voice
of
weeping
shall
be
no
more
heard
in
her
nor
the
voice
of
crying
65
20
there
shall
be
no
more
thence
an
infant
of
days
nor
an
old
man
that
hath
not
filled
his
days
for
the
child
shall
die
an
hundred
years
old
but
the
sinner
being
an
hundred
years
old
shall
be
accursed
65
21
and
they
shall
build
houses
and
inhabit
them
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
65
22
they
shall
not
build
and
another
inhabit
they
shall
not
plant
and
another
eat
for
as
the
days
of
a
tree
are
the
days
of
my
people
and
mine
elect
shall
long
enjoy
the
work
of
their
hands
65
23
they
shall
not
labour
in
vain
nor
bring
forth
for
trouble
for
they
are
the
seed
of
the
blessed
of
the
lord
and
their
offspring
with
them
65
24
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
65
25
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
feed
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
bullock
and
dust
shall
be
the
serpent’s
meat
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
saith
the
lord
66
1
thus
saith
the
lord
the
heaven
is
my
throne
and
the
earth
is
my
footstool
where
is
the
house
that
ye
build
unto
me
and
where
is
the
place
of
my
rest
66
2
for
all
those
things
hath
mine
hand
made
and
all
those
things
have
been
saith
the
lord
but
to
this
man
will
i
look
even
to
him
that
is
poor
and
of
a
contrite
spirit
and
trembleth
at
my
word
66
3
he
that
killeth
an
ox
is
as
if
he
slew
a
man
he
that
sacrificeth
a
lamb
as
if
he
cut
off
a
dog’s
neck
he
that
offereth
an
oblation
as
if
he
offered
swine’s
blood
he
that
burneth
incense
as
if
he
blessed
an
idol
yea
they
have
chosen
their
own
ways
and
their
soul
delighteth
in
their
abominations
66
4
i
also
will
choose
their
delusions
and
will
bring
their
fears
upon
them
because
when
i
called
none
did
answer
when
i
spake
they
did
not
hear
but
they
did
evil
before
mine
eyes
and
chose
that
in
which
i
delighted
not
66
5
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
that
tremble
at
his
word
your
brethren
that
hated
you
that
cast
you
out
for
my
name’s
sake
said
let
the
lord
be
glorified
but
he
shall
appear
to
your
joy
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
66
6
a
voice
of
noise
from
the
city
a
voice
from
the
temple
a
voice
of
the
lord
that
rendereth
recompence
to
his
enemies
66
7
before
she
travailed
she
brought
forth
before
her
pain
came
she
was
delivered
of
a
man
child
66
8
who
hath
heard
such
a
thing
who
hath
seen
such
things
shall
the
earth
be
made
to
bring
forth
in
one
day
or
shall
a
nation
be
born
at
once
for
as
soon
as
zion
travailed
she
brought
forth
her
children
66
9
shall
i
bring
to
the
birth
and
not
cause
to
bring
forth
saith
the
lord
shall
i
cause
to
bring
forth
and
shut
the
womb
saith
thy
god
66
10
rejoice
ye
with
jerusalem
and
be
glad
with
her
all
ye
that
love
her
rejoice
for
joy
with
her
all
ye
that
mourn
for
her
66
11
that
ye
may
suck
and
be
satisfied
with
the
breasts
of
her
consolations
that
ye
may
milk
out
and
be
delighted
with
the
abundance
of
her
glory
66
12
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
extend
peace
to
her
like
a
river
and
the
glory
of
the
gentiles
like
a
flowing
stream
then
shall
ye
suck
ye
shall
be
borne
upon
her
sides
and
be
dandled
upon
her
knees
66
13
as
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
so
will
i
comfort
you
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
in
jerusalem
66
14
and
when
ye
see
this
your
heart
shall
rejoice
and
your
bones
shall
flourish
like
an
herb
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
shall
be
known
toward
his
servants
and
his
indignation
toward
his
enemies
66
15
for
behold
the
lord
will
come
with
fire
and
with
his
chariots
like
a
whirlwind
to
render
his
anger
with
fury
and
his
rebuke
with
flames
of
fire
66
16
for
by
fire
and
by
his
sword
will
the
lord
plead
with
all
flesh
and
the
slain
of
the
lord
shall
be
many
66
17
they
that
sanctify
themselves
and
purify
themselves
in
the
gardens
behind
one
tree
in
the
midst
eating
swine’s
flesh
and
the
abomination
and
the
mouse
shall
be
consumed
together
saith
the
lord
66
18
for
i
know
their
works
and
their
thoughts
it
shall
come
that
i
will
gather
all
nations
and
tongues
and
they
shall
come
and
see
my
glory
66
19
and
i
will
set
a
sign
among
them
and
i
will
send
those
that
escape
of
them
unto
the
nations
to
tarshish
pul
and
lud
that
draw
the
bow
to
tubal
and
javan
to
the
isles
afar
off
that
have
not
heard
my
fame
neither
have
seen
my
glory
and
they
shall
declare
my
glory
among
the
gentiles
66
20
and
they
shall
bring
all
your
brethren
for
an
offering
unto
the
lord
out
of
all
nations
upon
horses
and
in
chariots
and
in
litters
and
upon
mules
and
upon
swift
beasts
to
my
holy
mountain
jerusalem
saith
the
lord
as
the
children
of
israel
bring
an
offering
in
a
clean
vessel
into
the
house
of
the
lord
66
21
and
i
will
also
take
of
them
for
priests
and
for
levites
saith
the
lord
66
22
for
as
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
which
i
will
make
shall
remain
before
me
saith
the
lord
so
shall
your
seed
and
your
name
remain
66
23
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
from
one
new
moon
to
another
and
from
one
sabbath
to
another
shall
all
flesh
come
to
worship
before
me
saith
the
lord
66
24
and
they
shall
go
forth
and
look
upon
the
carcases
of
the
men
that
have
transgressed
against
me
for
their
worm
shall
not
die
neither
shall
their
fire
be
quenched
and
they
shall
be
an
abhorring
unto
all
flesh
the
book
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
1
1
the
words
of
jeremiah
the
son
of
hilkiah
of
the
priests
that
were
in
anathoth
in
the
land
of
benjamin
1
2
to
whom
the
word
of
the
lord
came
in
the
days
of
josiah
the
son
of
amon
king
of
judah
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
his
reign
1
3
it
came
also
in
the
days
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
unto
the
end
of
the
eleventh
year
of
zedekiah
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
unto
the
carrying
away
of
jerusalem
captive
in
the
fifth
month
1
4
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
1
5
before
i
formed
thee
in
the
belly
i
knew
thee
and
before
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
womb
i
sanctified
thee
and
i
ordained
thee
a
prophet
unto
the
nations
1
6
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
i
cannot
speak
for
i
am
a
child
1
7
but
the
lord
said
unto
me
say
not
i
am
a
child
for
thou
shalt
go
to
all
that
i
shall
send
thee
and
whatsoever
i
command
thee
thou
shalt
speak
1
8
be
not
afraid
of
their
faces
for
i
am
with
thee
to
deliver
thee
saith
the
lord
1
9
then
the
lord
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
my
mouth
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
behold
i
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth
1
10
see
i
have
this
day
set
thee
over
the
nations
and
over
the
kingdoms
to
root
out
and
to
pull
down
and
to
destroy
and
to
throw
down
to
build
and
to
plant
1
11
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
jeremiah
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
i
see
a
rod
of
an
almond
tree
1
12
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
thou
hast
well
seen
for
i
will
hasten
my
word
to
perform
it
1
13
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
the
second
time
saying
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
i
see
a
seething
pot
and
the
face
thereof
is
toward
the
north
1
14
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
out
of
the
north
an
evil
shall
break
forth
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
1
15
for
lo
i
will
call
all
the
families
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
come
and
they
shall
set
every
one
his
throne
at
the
entering
of
the
gates
of
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
walls
thereof
round
about
and
against
all
the
cities
of
judah
1
16
and
i
will
utter
my
judgments
against
them
touching
all
their
wickedness
who
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
and
worshipped
the
works
of
their
own
hands
1
17
thou
therefore
gird
up
thy
loins
and
arise
and
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
command
thee
be
not
dismayed
at
their
faces
lest
i
confound
thee
before
them
1
18
for
behold
i
have
made
thee
this
day
a
defenced
city
and
an
iron
pillar
and
brasen
walls
against
the
whole
land
against
the
kings
of
judah
against
the
princes
thereof
against
the
priests
thereof
and
against
the
people
of
the
land
1
19
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
i
am
with
thee
saith
the
lord
to
deliver
thee
2
1
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
2
2
go
and
cry
in
the
ears
of
jerusalem
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
remember
thee
the
kindness
of
thy
youth
the
love
of
thine
espousals
when
thou
wentest
after
me
in
the
wilderness
in
a
land
that
was
not
sown
2
3
israel
was
holiness
unto
the
lord
and
the
firstfruits
of
his
increase
all
that
devour
him
shall
offend
evil
shall
come
upon
them
saith
the
lord
2
4
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
o
house
of
jacob
and
all
the
families
of
the
house
of
israel
2
5
thus
saith
the
lord
what
iniquity
have
your
fathers
found
in
me
that
they
are
gone
far
from
me
and
have
walked
after
vanity
and
are
become
vain
2
6
neither
said
they
where
is
the
lord
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
that
led
us
through
the
wilderness
through
a
land
of
deserts
and
of
pits
through
a
land
of
drought
and
of
the
shadow
of
death
through
a
land
that
no
man
passed
through
and
where
no
man
dwelt
2
7
and
i
brought
you
into
a
plentiful
country
to
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
goodness
thereof
but
when
ye
entered
ye
defiled
my
land
and
made
mine
heritage
an
abomination
2
8
the
priests
said
not
where
is
the
lord
and
they
that
handle
the
law
knew
me
not
the
pastors
also
transgressed
against
me
and
the
prophets
prophesied
by
baal
and
walked
after
things
that
do
not
profit
2
9
wherefore
i
will
yet
plead
with
you
saith
the
lord
and
with
your
children’s
children
will
i
plead
2
10
for
pass
over
the
isles
of
chittim
and
see
and
send
unto
kedar
and
consider
diligently
and
see
if
there
be
such
a
thing
2
11
hath
a
nation
changed
their
gods
which
are
yet
no
gods
but
my
people
have
changed
their
glory
for
that
which
doth
not
profit
2
12
be
astonished
o
ye
heavens
at
this
and
be
horribly
afraid
be
ye
very
desolate
saith
the
lord
2
13
for
my
people
have
committed
two
evils
they
have
forsaken
me
the
fountain
of
living
waters
and
hewed
them
out
cisterns
broken
cisterns
that
can
hold
no
water
2
14
is
israel
a
servant
is
he
a
homeborn
slave
why
is
he
spoiled
2
15
the
young
lions
roared
upon
him
and
yelled
and
they
made
his
land
waste
his
cities
are
burned
without
inhabitant
2
16
also
the
children
of
noph
and
tahapanes
have
broken
the
crown
of
thy
head
2
17
hast
thou
not
procured
this
unto
thyself
in
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
when
he
led
thee
by
the
way
2
18
and
now
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
egypt
to
drink
the
waters
of
sihor
or
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
assyria
to
drink
the
waters
of
the
river
2
19
thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee
know
therefore
and
see
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
and
bitter
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
and
that
my
fear
is
not
in
thee
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
2
20
for
of
old
time
i
have
broken
thy
yoke
and
burst
thy
bands
and
thou
saidst
i
will
not
transgress
when
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
thou
wanderest
playing
the
harlot
2
21
yet
i
had
planted
thee
a
noble
vine
wholly
a
right
seed
how
then
art
thou
turned
into
the
degenerate
plant
of
a
strange
vine
unto
me
2
22
for
though
thou
wash
thee
with
nitre
and
take
thee
much
soap
yet
thine
iniquity
is
marked
before
me
saith
the
lord
god
2
23
how
canst
thou
say
i
am
not
polluted
i
have
not
gone
after
baalim
see
thy
way
in
the
valley
know
what
thou
hast
done
thou
art
a
swift
dromedary
traversing
her
ways
2
24
a
wild
ass
used
to
the
wilderness
that
snuffeth
up
the
wind
at
her
pleasure
in
her
occasion
who
can
turn
her
away
all
they
that
seek
her
will
not
weary
themselves
in
her
month
they
shall
find
her
2
25
withhold
thy
foot
from
being
unshod
and
thy
throat
from
thirst
but
thou
saidst
there
is
no
hope
no
for
i
have
loved
strangers
and
after
them
will
i
go
2
26
as
the
thief
is
ashamed
when
he
is
found
so
is
the
house
of
israel
ashamed
they
their
kings
their
princes
and
their
priests
and
their
prophets
2
27
saying
to
a
stock
thou
art
my
father
and
to
a
stone
thou
hast
brought
me
forth
for
they
have
turned
their
back
unto
me
and
not
their
face
but
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
they
will
say
arise
and
save
us
2
28
but
where
are
thy
gods
that
thou
hast
made
thee
let
them
arise
if
they
can
save
thee
in
the
time
of
thy
trouble
for
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
are
thy
gods
o
judah
2
29
wherefore
will
ye
plead
with
me
ye
all
have
transgressed
against
me
saith
the
lord
2
30
in
vain
have
i
smitten
your
children
they
received
no
correction
your
own
sword
hath
devoured
your
prophets
like
a
destroying
lion
2
31
o
generation
see
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
have
i
been
a
wilderness
unto
israel
a
land
of
darkness
wherefore
say
my
people
we
are
lords
we
will
come
no
more
unto
thee
2
32
can
a
maid
forget
her
ornaments
or
a
bride
her
attire
yet
my
people
have
forgotten
me
days
without
number
2
33
why
trimmest
thou
thy
way
to
seek
love
therefore
hast
thou
also
taught
the
wicked
ones
thy
ways
2
34
also
in
thy
skirts
is
found
the
blood
of
the
souls
of
the
poor
innocents
i
have
not
found
it
by
secret
search
but
upon
all
these
2
35
yet
thou
sayest
because
i
am
innocent
surely
his
anger
shall
turn
from
me
behold
i
will
plead
with
thee
because
thou
sayest
i
have
not
sinned
2
36
why
gaddest
thou
about
so
much
to
change
thy
way
thou
also
shalt
be
ashamed
of
egypt
as
thou
wast
ashamed
of
assyria
2
37
yea
thou
shalt
go
forth
from
him
and
thine
hands
upon
thine
head
for
the
lord
hath
rejected
thy
confidences
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
in
them
3
1
they
say
if
a
man
put
away
his
wife
and
she
go
from
him
and
become
another
man’s
shall
he
return
unto
her
again
shall
not
that
land
be
greatly
polluted
but
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
many
lovers
yet
return
again
to
me
saith
the
lord
3
2
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
the
high
places
and
see
where
thou
hast
not
been
lien
with
in
the
ways
hast
thou
sat
for
them
as
the
arabian
in
the
wilderness
and
thou
hast
polluted
the
land
with
thy
whoredoms
and
with
thy
wickedness
3
3
therefore
the
showers
have
been
withholden
and
there
hath
been
no
latter
rain
and
thou
hadst
a
whore’s
forehead
thou
refusedst
to
be
ashamed
3
4
wilt
thou
not
from
this
time
cry
unto
me
my
father
thou
art
the
guide
of
my
youth
3
5
will
he
reserve
his
anger
for
ever
will
he
keep
it
to
the
end
behold
thou
hast
spoken
and
done
evil
things
as
thou
couldest
3
6
the
lord
said
also
unto
me
in
the
days
of
josiah
the
king
hast
thou
seen
that
which
backsliding
israel
hath
done
she
is
gone
up
upon
every
high
mountain
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
hath
played
the
harlot
3
7
and
i
said
after
she
had
done
all
these
things
turn
thou
unto
me
but
she
returned
not
and
her
treacherous
sister
judah
saw
it
3
8
and
i
saw
when
for
all
the
causes
whereby
backsliding
israel
committed
adultery
i
had
put
her
away
and
given
her
a
bill
of
divorce
yet
her
treacherous
sister
judah
feared
not
but
went
and
played
the
harlot
also
3
9
and
it
came
to
pass
through
the
lightness
of
her
whoredom
that
she
defiled
the
land
and
committed
adultery
with
stones
and
with
stocks
3
10
and
yet
for
all
this
her
treacherous
sister
judah
hath
not
turned
unto
me
with
her
whole
heart
but
feignedly
saith
the
lord
3
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
the
backsliding
israel
hath
justified
herself
more
than
treacherous
judah
3
12
go
and
proclaim
these
words
toward
the
north
and
say
return
thou
backsliding
israel
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
not
cause
mine
anger
to
fall
upon
you
for
i
am
merciful
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
not
keep
anger
for
ever
3
13
only
acknowledge
thine
iniquity
that
thou
hast
transgressed
against
the
lord
thy
god
and
hast
scattered
thy
ways
to
the
strangers
under
every
green
tree
and
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
saith
the
lord
3
14
turn
o
backsliding
children
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
married
unto
you
and
i
will
take
you
one
of
a
city
and
two
of
a
family
and
i
will
bring
you
to
zion
3
15
and
i
will
give
you
pastors
according
to
mine
heart
which
shall
feed
you
with
knowledge
and
understanding
3
16
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
ye
be
multiplied
and
increased
in
the
land
in
those
days
saith
the
lord
they
shall
say
no
more
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
neither
shall
it
come
to
mind
neither
shall
they
remember
it
neither
shall
they
visit
it
neither
shall
that
be
done
any
more
3
17
at
that
time
they
shall
call
jerusalem
the
throne
of
the
lord
and
all
the
nations
shall
be
gathered
unto
it
to
the
name
of
the
lord
to
jerusalem
neither
shall
they
walk
any
more
after
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
3
18
in
those
days
the
house
of
judah
shall
walk
with
the
house
of
israel
and
they
shall
come
together
out
of
the
land
of
the
north
to
the
land
that
i
have
given
for
an
inheritance
unto
your
fathers
3
19
but
i
said
how
shall
i
put
thee
among
the
children
and
give
thee
a
pleasant
land
a
goodly
heritage
of
the
hosts
of
nations
and
i
said
thou
shalt
call
me
my
father
and
shalt
not
turn
away
from
me
3
20
surely
as
a
wife
treacherously
departeth
from
her
husband
so
have
ye
dealt
treacherously
with
me
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
3
21
a
voice
was
heard
upon
the
high
places
weeping
and
supplications
of
the
children
of
israel
for
they
have
perverted
their
way
and
they
have
forgotten
the
lord
their
god
3
22
return
ye
backsliding
children
and
i
will
heal
your
backslidings
behold
we
come
unto
thee
for
thou
art
the
lord
our
god
3
23
truly
in
vain
is
salvation
hoped
for
from
the
hills
and
from
the
multitude
of
mountains
truly
in
the
lord
our
god
is
the
salvation
of
israel
3
24
for
shame
hath
devoured
the
labour
of
our
fathers
from
our
youth
their
flocks
and
their
herds
their
sons
and
their
daughters
3
25
we
lie
down
in
our
shame
and
our
confusion
covereth
us
for
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
our
god
we
and
our
fathers
from
our
youth
even
unto
this
day
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
4
1
if
thou
wilt
return
o
israel
saith
the
lord
return
unto
me
and
if
thou
wilt
put
away
thine
abominations
out
of
my
sight
then
shalt
thou
not
remove
4
2
and
thou
shalt
swear
the
lord
liveth
in
truth
in
judgment
and
in
righteousness
and
the
nations
shall
bless
themselves
in
him
and
in
him
shall
they
glory
4
3
for
thus
saith
the
lord
to
the
men
of
judah
and
jerusalem
break
up
your
fallow
ground
and
sow
not
among
thorns
4
4
circumcise
yourselves
to
the
lord
and
take
away
the
foreskins
of
your
heart
ye
men
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
lest
my
fury
come
forth
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
4
5
declare
ye
in
judah
and
publish
in
jerusalem
and
say
blow
ye
the
trumpet
in
the
land
cry
gather
together
and
say
assemble
yourselves
and
let
us
go
into
the
defenced
cities
4
6
set
up
the
standard
toward
zion
retire
stay
not
for
i
will
bring
evil
from
the
north
and
a
great
destruction
4
7
the
lion
is
come
up
from
his
thicket
and
the
destroyer
of
the
gentiles
is
on
his
way
he
is
gone
forth
from
his
place
to
make
thy
land
desolate
and
thy
cities
shall
be
laid
waste
without
an
inhabitant
4
8
for
this
gird
you
with
sackcloth
lament
and
howl
for
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
is
not
turned
back
from
us
4
9
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day
saith
the
lord
that
the
heart
of
the
king
shall
perish
and
the
heart
of
the
princes
and
the
priests
shall
be
astonished
and
the
prophets
shall
wonder
4
10
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
surely
thou
hast
greatly
deceived
this
people
and
jerusalem
saying
ye
shall
have
peace
whereas
the
sword
reacheth
unto
the
soul
4
11
at
that
time
shall
it
be
said
to
this
people
and
to
jerusalem
a
dry
wind
of
the
high
places
in
the
wilderness
toward
the
daughter
of
my
people
not
to
fan
nor
to
cleanse
4
12
even
a
full
wind
from
those
places
shall
come
unto
me
now
also
will
i
give
sentence
against
them
4
13
behold
he
shall
come
up
as
clouds
and
his
chariots
shall
be
as
a
whirlwind
his
horses
are
swifter
than
eagles
woe
unto
us
for
we
are
spoiled
4
14
o
jerusalem
wash
thine
heart
from
wickedness
that
thou
mayest
be
saved
how
long
shall
thy
vain
thoughts
lodge
within
thee
4
15
for
a
voice
declareth
from
dan
and
publisheth
affliction
from
mount
ephraim
4
16
make
ye
mention
to
the
nations
behold
publish
against
jerusalem
that
watchers
come
from
a
far
country
and
give
out
their
voice
against
the
cities
of
judah
4
17
as
keepers
of
a
field
are
they
against
her
round
about
because
she
hath
been
rebellious
against
me
saith
the
lord
4
18
thy
way
and
thy
doings
have
procured
these
things
unto
thee
this
is
thy
wickedness
because
it
is
bitter
because
it
reacheth
unto
thine
heart
4
19
my
bowels
my
bowels
i
am
pained
at
my
very
heart
my
heart
maketh
a
noise
in
me
i
cannot
hold
my
peace
because
thou
hast
heard
o
my
soul
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
alarm
of
war
4
20
destruction
upon
destruction
is
cried
for
the
whole
land
is
spoiled
suddenly
are
my
tents
spoiled
and
my
curtains
in
a
moment
4
21
how
long
shall
i
see
the
standard
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
4
22
for
my
people
is
foolish
they
have
not
known
me
they
are
sottish
children
and
they
have
none
understanding
they
are
wise
to
do
evil
but
to
do
good
they
have
no
knowledge
4
23
i
beheld
the
earth
and
lo
it
was
without
form
and
void
and
the
heavens
and
they
had
no
light
4
24
i
beheld
the
mountains
and
lo
they
trembled
and
all
the
hills
moved
lightly
4
25
i
beheld
and
lo
there
was
no
man
and
all
the
birds
of
the
heavens
were
fled
4
26
i
beheld
and
lo
the
fruitful
place
was
a
wilderness
and
all
the
cities
thereof
were
broken
down
at
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
by
his
fierce
anger
4
27
for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
the
whole
land
shall
be
desolate
yet
will
i
not
make
a
full
end
4
28
for
this
shall
the
earth
mourn
and
the
heavens
above
be
black
because
i
have
spoken
it
i
have
purposed
it
and
will
not
repent
neither
will
i
turn
back
from
it
4
29
the
whole
city
shall
flee
for
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
and
bowmen
they
shall
go
into
thickets
and
climb
up
upon
the
rocks
every
city
shall
be
forsaken
and
not
a
man
dwell
therein
4
30
and
when
thou
art
spoiled
what
wilt
thou
do
though
thou
clothest
thyself
with
crimson
though
thou
deckest
thee
with
ornaments
of
gold
though
thou
rentest
thy
face
with
painting
in
vain
shalt
thou
make
thyself
fair
thy
lovers
will
despise
thee
they
will
seek
thy
life
4
31
for
i
have
heard
a
voice
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
and
the
anguish
as
of
her
that
bringeth
forth
her
first
child
the
voice
of
the
daughter
of
zion
that
bewaileth
herself
that
spreadeth
her
hands
saying
woe
is
me
now
for
my
soul
is
wearied
because
of
murderers
5
1
run
ye
to
and
fro
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
see
now
and
know
and
seek
in
the
broad
places
thereof
if
ye
can
find
a
man
if
there
be
any
that
executeth
judgment
that
seeketh
the
truth
and
i
will
pardon
it
5
2
and
though
they
say
the
lord
liveth
surely
they
swear
falsely
5
3
o
lord
are
not
thine
eyes
upon
the
truth
thou
hast
stricken
them
but
they
have
not
grieved
thou
hast
consumed
them
but
they
have
refused
to
receive
correction
they
have
made
their
faces
harder
than
a
rock
they
have
refused
to
return
5
4
therefore
i
said
surely
these
are
poor
they
are
foolish
for
they
know
not
the
way
of
the
lord
nor
the
judgment
of
their
god
5
5
i
will
get
me
unto
the
great
men
and
will
speak
unto
them
for
they
have
known
the
way
of
the
lord
and
the
judgment
of
their
god
but
these
have
altogether
broken
the
yoke
and
burst
the
bonds
5
6
wherefore
a
lion
out
of
the
forest
shall
slay
them
and
a
wolf
of
the
evenings
shall
spoil
them
a
leopard
shall
watch
over
their
cities
every
one
that
goeth
out
thence
shall
be
torn
in
pieces
because
their
transgressions
are
many
and
their
backslidings
are
increased
5
7
how
shall
i
pardon
thee
for
this
thy
children
have
forsaken
me
and
sworn
by
them
that
are
no
gods
when
i
had
fed
them
to
the
full
they
then
committed
adultery
and
assembled
themselves
by
troops
in
the
harlots’
houses
5
8
they
were
as
fed
horses
in
the
morning
every
one
neighed
after
his
neighbour’s
wife
5
9
shall
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
and
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
5
10
go
ye
up
upon
her
walls
and
destroy
but
make
not
a
full
end
take
away
her
battlements
for
they
are
not
the
lord’s
5
11
for
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
have
dealt
very
treacherously
against
me
saith
the
lord
5
12
they
have
belied
the
lord
and
said
it
is
not
he
neither
shall
evil
come
upon
us
neither
shall
we
see
sword
nor
famine
5
13
and
the
prophets
shall
become
wind
and
the
word
is
not
in
them
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
them
5
14
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
because
ye
speak
this
word
behold
i
will
make
my
words
in
thy
mouth
fire
and
this
people
wood
and
it
shall
devour
them
5
15
lo
i
will
bring
a
nation
upon
you
from
far
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
it
is
a
mighty
nation
it
is
an
ancient
nation
a
nation
whose
language
thou
knowest
not
neither
understandest
what
they
say
5
16
their
quiver
is
as
an
open
sepulchre
they
are
all
mighty
men
5
17
and
they
shall
eat
up
thine
harvest
and
thy
bread
which
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
should
eat
they
shall
eat
up
thy
flocks
and
thine
herds
they
shall
eat
up
thy
vines
and
thy
fig
trees
they
shall
impoverish
thy
fenced
cities
wherein
thou
trustedst
with
the
sword
5
18
nevertheless
in
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
with
you
5
19
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
ye
shall
say
wherefore
doeth
the
lord
our
god
all
these
things
unto
us
then
shalt
thou
answer
them
like
as
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
served
strange
gods
in
your
land
so
shall
ye
serve
strangers
in
a
land
that
is
not
yours
5
20
declare
this
in
the
house
of
jacob
and
publish
it
in
judah
saying
5
21
hear
now
this
o
foolish
people
and
without
understanding
which
have
eyes
and
see
not
which
have
ears
and
hear
not
5
22
fear
ye
not
me
saith
the
lord
will
ye
not
tremble
at
my
presence
which
have
placed
the
sand
for
the
bound
of
the
sea
by
a
perpetual
decree
that
it
cannot
pass
it
and
though
the
waves
thereof
toss
themselves
yet
can
they
not
prevail
though
they
roar
yet
can
they
not
pass
over
it
5
23
but
this
people
hath
a
revolting
and
a
rebellious
heart
they
are
revolted
and
gone
5
24
neither
say
they
in
their
heart
let
us
now
fear
the
lord
our
god
that
giveth
rain
both
the
former
and
the
latter
in
his
season
he
reserveth
unto
us
the
appointed
weeks
of
the
harvest
5
25
your
iniquities
have
turned
away
these
things
and
your
sins
have
withholden
good
things
from
you
5
26
for
among
my
people
are
found
wicked
men
they
lay
wait
as
he
that
setteth
snares
they
set
a
trap
they
catch
men
5
27
as
a
cage
is
full
of
birds
so
are
their
houses
full
of
deceit
therefore
they
are
become
great
and
waxen
rich
5
28
they
are
waxen
fat
they
shine
yea
they
overpass
the
deeds
of
the
wicked
they
judge
not
the
cause
the
cause
of
the
fatherless
yet
they
prosper
and
the
right
of
the
needy
do
they
not
judge
5
29
shall
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
5
30
a
wonderful
and
horrible
thing
is
committed
in
the
land
5
31
the
prophets
prophesy
falsely
and
the
priests
bear
rule
by
their
means
and
my
people
love
to
have
it
so
and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
end
thereof
6
1
o
ye
children
of
benjamin
gather
yourselves
to
flee
out
of
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
blow
the
trumpet
in
tekoa
and
set
up
a
sign
of
fire
in
bethhaccerem
for
evil
appeareth
out
of
the
north
and
great
destruction
6
2
i
have
likened
the
daughter
of
zion
to
a
comely
and
delicate
woman
6
3
the
shepherds
with
their
flocks
shall
come
unto
her
they
shall
pitch
their
tents
against
her
round
about
they
shall
feed
every
one
in
his
place
6
4
prepare
ye
war
against
her
arise
and
let
us
go
up
at
noon
woe
unto
us
for
the
day
goeth
away
for
the
shadows
of
the
evening
are
stretched
out
6
5
arise
and
let
us
go
by
night
and
let
us
destroy
her
palaces
6
6
for
thus
hath
the
lord
of
hosts
said
hew
ye
down
trees
and
cast
a
mount
against
jerusalem
this
is
the
city
to
be
visited
she
is
wholly
oppression
in
the
midst
of
her
6
7
as
a
fountain
casteth
out
her
waters
so
she
casteth
out
her
wickedness
violence
and
spoil
is
heard
in
her
before
me
continually
is
grief
and
wounds
6
8
be
thou
instructed
o
jerusalem
lest
my
soul
depart
from
thee
lest
i
make
thee
desolate
a
land
not
inhabited
6
9
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
they
shall
throughly
glean
the
remnant
of
israel
as
a
vine
turn
back
thine
hand
as
a
grapegatherer
into
the
baskets
6
10
to
whom
shall
i
speak
and
give
warning
that
they
may
hear
behold
their
ear
is
uncircumcised
and
they
cannot
hearken
behold
the
word
of
the
lord
is
unto
them
a
reproach
they
have
no
delight
in
it
6
11
therefore
i
am
full
of
the
fury
of
the
lord
i
am
weary
with
holding
in
i
will
pour
it
out
upon
the
children
abroad
and
upon
the
assembly
of
young
men
together
for
even
the
husband
with
the
wife
shall
be
taken
the
aged
with
him
that
is
full
of
days
6
12
and
their
houses
shall
be
turned
unto
others
with
their
fields
and
wives
together
for
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
saith
the
lord
6
13
for
from
the
least
of
them
even
unto
the
greatest
of
them
every
one
is
given
to
covetousness
and
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely
6
14
they
have
healed
also
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly
saying
peace
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
6
15
were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination
nay
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed
neither
could
they
blush
therefore
they
shall
fall
among
them
that
fall
at
the
time
that
i
visit
them
they
shall
be
cast
down
saith
the
lord
6
16
thus
saith
the
lord
stand
ye
in
the
ways
and
see
and
ask
for
the
old
paths
where
is
the
good
way
and
walk
therein
and
ye
shall
find
rest
for
your
souls
but
they
said
we
will
not
walk
therein
6
17
also
i
set
watchmen
over
you
saying
hearken
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
but
they
said
we
will
not
hearken
6
18
therefore
hear
ye
nations
and
know
o
congregation
what
is
among
them
6
19
hear
o
earth
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
people
even
the
fruit
of
their
thoughts
because
they
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
words
nor
to
my
law
but
rejected
it
6
20
to
what
purpose
cometh
there
to
me
incense
from
sheba
and
the
sweet
cane
from
a
far
country
your
burnt
offerings
are
not
acceptable
nor
your
sacrifices
sweet
unto
me
6
21
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
lay
stumblingblocks
before
this
people
and
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together
shall
fall
upon
them
the
neighbour
and
his
friend
shall
perish
6
22
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
a
people
cometh
from
the
north
country
and
a
great
nation
shall
be
raised
from
the
sides
of
the
earth
6
23
they
shall
lay
hold
on
bow
and
spear
they
are
cruel
and
have
no
mercy
their
voice
roareth
like
the
sea
and
they
ride
upon
horses
set
in
array
as
men
for
war
against
thee
o
daughter
of
zion
6
24
we
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
our
hands
wax
feeble
anguish
hath
taken
hold
of
us
and
pain
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
6
25
go
not
forth
into
the
field
nor
walk
by
the
way
for
the
sword
of
the
enemy
and
fear
is
on
every
side
6
26
o
daughter
of
my
people
gird
thee
with
sackcloth
and
wallow
thyself
in
ashes
make
thee
mourning
as
for
an
only
son
most
bitter
lamentation
for
the
spoiler
shall
suddenly
come
upon
us
6
27
i
have
set
thee
for
a
tower
and
a
fortress
among
my
people
that
thou
mayest
know
and
try
their
way
6
28
they
are
all
grievous
revolters
walking
with
slanders
they
are
brass
and
iron
they
are
all
corrupters
6
29
the
bellows
are
burned
the
lead
is
consumed
of
the
fire
the
founder
melteth
in
vain
for
the
wicked
are
not
plucked
away
6
30
reprobate
silver
shall
men
call
them
because
the
lord
hath
rejected
them
7
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
7
2
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
and
proclaim
there
this
word
and
say
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
all
ye
of
judah
that
enter
in
at
these
gates
to
worship
the
lord
7
3
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
and
i
will
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place
7
4
trust
ye
not
in
lying
words
saying
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
are
these
7
5
for
if
ye
throughly
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
if
ye
throughly
execute
judgment
between
a
man
and
his
neighbour
7
6
if
ye
oppress
not
the
stranger
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
and
shed
not
innocent
blood
in
this
place
neither
walk
after
other
gods
to
your
hurt
7
7
then
will
i
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place
in
the
land
that
i
gave
to
your
fathers
for
ever
and
ever
7
8
behold
ye
trust
in
lying
words
that
cannot
profit
7
9
will
ye
steal
murder
and
commit
adultery
and
swear
falsely
and
burn
incense
unto
baal
and
walk
after
other
gods
whom
ye
know
not
7
10
and
come
and
stand
before
me
in
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
and
say
we
are
delivered
to
do
all
these
abominations
7
11
is
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
become
a
den
of
robbers
in
your
eyes
behold
even
i
have
seen
it
saith
the
lord
7
12
but
go
ye
now
unto
my
place
which
was
in
shiloh
where
i
set
my
name
at
the
first
and
see
what
i
did
to
it
for
the
wickedness
of
my
people
israel
7
13
and
now
because
ye
have
done
all
these
works
saith
the
lord
and
i
spake
unto
you
rising
up
early
and
speaking
but
ye
heard
not
and
i
called
you
but
ye
answered
not
7
14
therefore
will
i
do
unto
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
wherein
ye
trust
and
unto
the
place
which
i
gave
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
as
i
have
done
to
shiloh
7
15
and
i
will
cast
you
out
of
my
sight
as
i
have
cast
out
all
your
brethren
even
the
whole
seed
of
ephraim
7
16
therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
up
cry
nor
prayer
for
them
neither
make
intercession
to
me
for
i
will
not
hear
thee
7
17
seest
thou
not
what
they
do
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
7
18
the
children
gather
wood
and
the
fathers
kindle
the
fire
and
the
women
knead
their
dough
to
make
cakes
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
that
they
may
provoke
me
to
anger
7
19
do
they
provoke
me
to
anger
saith
the
lord
do
they
not
provoke
themselves
to
the
confusion
of
their
own
faces
7
20
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
mine
anger
and
my
fury
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place
upon
man
and
upon
beast
and
upon
the
trees
of
the
field
and
upon
the
fruit
of
the
ground
and
it
shall
burn
and
shall
not
be
quenched
7
21
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
put
your
burnt
offerings
unto
your
sacrifices
and
eat
flesh
7
22
for
i
spake
not
unto
your
fathers
nor
commanded
them
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
concerning
burnt
offerings
or
sacrifices
7
23
but
this
thing
commanded
i
them
saying
obey
my
voice
and
i
will
be
your
god
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
walk
ye
in
all
the
ways
that
i
have
commanded
you
that
it
may
be
well
unto
you
7
24
but
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
in
the
counsels
and
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
and
went
backward
and
not
forward
7
25
since
the
day
that
your
fathers
came
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
unto
this
day
i
have
even
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
daily
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
7
26
yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
me
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
hardened
their
neck
they
did
worse
than
their
fathers
7
27
therefore
thou
shalt
speak
all
these
words
unto
them
but
they
will
not
hearken
to
thee
thou
shalt
also
call
unto
them
but
they
will
not
answer
thee
7
28
but
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
this
is
a
nation
that
obeyeth
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
nor
receiveth
correction
truth
is
perished
and
is
cut
off
from
their
mouth
7
29
cut
off
thine
hair
o
jerusalem
and
cast
it
away
and
take
up
a
lamentation
on
high
places
for
the
lord
hath
rejected
and
forsaken
the
generation
of
his
wrath
7
30
for
the
children
of
judah
have
done
evil
in
my
sight
saith
the
lord
they
have
set
their
abominations
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
to
pollute
it
7
31
and
they
have
built
the
high
places
of
tophet
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
to
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
fire
which
i
commanded
them
not
neither
came
it
into
my
heart
7
32
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
it
shall
no
more
be
called
tophet
nor
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
but
the
valley
of
slaughter
for
they
shall
bury
in
tophet
till
there
be
no
place
7
33
and
the
carcases
of
this
people
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
none
shall
fray
them
away
7
34
then
will
i
cause
to
cease
from
the
cities
of
judah
and
from
the
streets
of
jerusalem
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
for
the
land
shall
be
desolate
8
1
at
that
time
saith
the
lord
they
shall
bring
out
the
bones
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
the
bones
of
his
princes
and
the
bones
of
the
priests
and
the
bones
of
the
prophets
and
the
bones
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
out
of
their
graves
8
2
and
they
shall
spread
them
before
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
whom
they
have
loved
and
whom
they
have
served
and
after
whom
they
have
walked
and
whom
they
have
sought
and
whom
they
have
worshipped
they
shall
not
be
gathered
nor
be
buried
they
shall
be
for
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
8
3
and
death
shall
be
chosen
rather
than
life
by
all
the
residue
of
them
that
remain
of
this
evil
family
which
remain
in
all
the
places
whither
i
have
driven
them
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
8
4
moreover
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
shall
they
fall
and
not
arise
shall
he
turn
away
and
not
return
8
5
why
then
is
this
people
of
jerusalem
slidden
back
by
a
perpetual
backsliding
they
hold
fast
deceit
they
refuse
to
return
8
6
i
hearkened
and
heard
but
they
spake
not
aright
no
man
repented
him
of
his
wickedness
saying
what
have
i
done
every
one
turned
to
his
course
as
the
horse
rusheth
into
the
battle
8
7
yea
the
stork
in
the
heaven
knoweth
her
appointed
times
and
the
turtle
and
the
crane
and
the
swallow
observe
the
time
of
their
coming
but
my
people
know
not
the
judgment
of
the
lord
8
8
how
do
ye
say
we
are
wise
and
the
law
of
the
lord
is
with
us
lo
certainly
in
vain
made
he
it
the
pen
of
the
scribes
is
in
vain
8
9
the
wise
men
are
ashamed
they
are
dismayed
and
taken
lo
they
have
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
and
what
wisdom
is
in
them
8
10
therefore
will
i
give
their
wives
unto
others
and
their
fields
to
them
that
shall
inherit
them
for
every
one
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
is
given
to
covetousness
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely
8
11
for
they
have
healed
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly
saying
peace
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
8
12
were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination
nay
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed
neither
could
they
blush
therefore
shall
they
fall
among
them
that
fall
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
be
cast
down
saith
the
lord
8
13
i
will
surely
consume
them
saith
the
lord
there
shall
be
no
grapes
on
the
vine
nor
figs
on
the
fig
tree
and
the
leaf
shall
fade
and
the
things
that
i
have
given
them
shall
pass
away
from
them
8
14
why
do
we
sit
still
assemble
yourselves
and
let
us
enter
into
the
defenced
cities
and
let
us
be
silent
there
for
the
lord
our
god
hath
put
us
to
silence
and
given
us
water
of
gall
to
drink
because
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
8
15
we
looked
for
peace
but
no
good
came
and
for
a
time
of
health
and
behold
trouble
8
16
the
snorting
of
his
horses
was
heard
from
dan
the
whole
land
trembled
at
the
sound
of
the
neighing
of
his
strong
ones
for
they
are
come
and
have
devoured
the
land
and
all
that
is
in
it
the
city
and
those
that
dwell
therein
8
17
for
behold
i
will
send
serpents
cockatrices
among
you
which
will
not
be
charmed
and
they
shall
bite
you
saith
the
lord
8
18
when
i
would
comfort
myself
against
sorrow
my
heart
is
faint
in
me
8
19
behold
the
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
because
of
them
that
dwell
in
a
far
country
is
not
the
lord
in
zion
is
not
her
king
in
her
why
have
they
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
graven
images
and
with
strange
vanities
8
20
the
harvest
is
past
the
summer
is
ended
and
we
are
not
saved
8
21
for
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
am
i
hurt
i
am
black
astonishment
hath
taken
hold
on
me
8
22
is
there
no
balm
in
gilead
is
there
no
physician
there
why
then
is
not
the
health
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
recovered
9
1
oh
that
my
head
were
waters
and
mine
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears
that
i
might
weep
day
and
night
for
the
slain
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
9
2
oh
that
i
had
in
the
wilderness
a
lodging
place
of
wayfaring
men
that
i
might
leave
my
people
and
go
from
them
for
they
be
all
adulterers
an
assembly
of
treacherous
men
9
3
and
they
bend
their
tongues
like
their
bow
for
lies
but
they
are
not
valiant
for
the
truth
upon
the
earth
for
they
proceed
from
evil
to
evil
and
they
know
not
me
saith
the
lord
9
4
take
ye
heed
every
one
of
his
neighbour
and
trust
ye
not
in
any
brother
for
every
brother
will
utterly
supplant
and
every
neighbour
will
walk
with
slanders
9
5
and
they
will
deceive
every
one
his
neighbour
and
will
not
speak
the
truth
they
have
taught
their
tongue
to
speak
lies
and
weary
themselves
to
commit
iniquity
9
6
thine
habitation
is
in
the
midst
of
deceit
through
deceit
they
refuse
to
know
me
saith
the
lord
9
7
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
melt
them
and
try
them
for
how
shall
i
do
for
the
daughter
of
my
people
9
8
their
tongue
is
as
an
arrow
shot
out
it
speaketh
deceit
one
speaketh
peaceably
to
his
neighbour
with
his
mouth
but
in
heart
he
layeth
his
wait
9
9
shall
i
not
visit
them
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
9
10
for
the
mountains
will
i
take
up
a
weeping
and
wailing
and
for
the
habitations
of
the
wilderness
a
lamentation
because
they
are
burned
up
so
that
none
can
pass
through
them
neither
can
men
hear
the
voice
of
the
cattle
both
the
fowl
of
the
heavens
and
the
beast
are
fled
they
are
gone
9
11
and
i
will
make
jerusalem
heaps
and
a
den
of
dragons
and
i
will
make
the
cities
of
judah
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
9
12
who
is
the
wise
man
that
may
understand
this
and
who
is
he
to
whom
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
that
he
may
declare
it
for
what
the
land
perisheth
and
is
burned
up
like
a
wilderness
that
none
passeth
through
9
13
and
the
lord
saith
because
they
have
forsaken
my
law
which
i
set
before
them
and
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
neither
walked
therein
9
14
but
have
walked
after
the
imagination
of
their
own
heart
and
after
baalim
which
their
fathers
taught
them
9
15
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
feed
them
even
this
people
with
wormwood
and
give
them
water
of
gall
to
drink
9
16
i
will
scatter
them
also
among
the
heathen
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known
and
i
will
send
a
sword
after
them
till
i
have
consumed
them
9
17
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
consider
ye
and
call
for
the
mourning
women
that
they
may
come
and
send
for
cunning
women
that
they
may
come
9
18
and
let
them
make
haste
and
take
up
a
wailing
for
us
that
our
eyes
may
run
down
with
tears
and
our
eyelids
gush
out
with
waters
9
19
for
a
voice
of
wailing
is
heard
out
of
zion
how
are
we
spoiled
we
are
greatly
confounded
because
we
have
forsaken
the
land
because
our
dwellings
have
cast
us
out
9
20
yet
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
ye
women
and
let
your
ear
receive
the
word
of
his
mouth
and
teach
your
daughters
wailing
and
every
one
her
neighbour
lamentation
9
21
for
death
is
come
up
into
our
windows
and
is
entered
into
our
palaces
to
cut
off
the
children
from
without
and
the
young
men
from
the
streets
9
22
speak
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
carcases
of
men
shall
fall
as
dung
upon
the
open
field
and
as
the
handful
after
the
harvestman
and
none
shall
gather
them
9
23
thus
saith
the
lord
let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches
9
24
but
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me
that
i
am
the
lord
which
exercise
lovingkindness
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
earth
for
in
these
things
i
delight
saith
the
lord
9
25
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
punish
all
them
which
are
circumcised
with
the
uncircumcised
9
26
egypt
and
judah
and
edom
and
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
and
all
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness
for
all
these
nations
are
uncircumcised
and
all
the
house
of
israel
are
uncircumcised
in
the
heart
10
1
hear
ye
the
word
which
the
lord
speaketh
unto
you
o
house
of
israel
10
2
thus
saith
the
lord
learn
not
the
way
of
the
heathen
and
be
not
dismayed
at
the
signs
of
heaven
for
the
heathen
are
dismayed
at
them
10
3
for
the
customs
of
the
people
are
vain
for
one
cutteth
a
tree
out
of
the
forest
the
work
of
the
hands
of
the
workman
with
the
axe
10
4
they
deck
it
with
silver
and
with
gold
they
fasten
it
with
nails
and
with
hammers
that
it
move
not
10
5
they
are
upright
as
the
palm
tree
but
speak
not
they
must
needs
be
borne
because
they
cannot
go
be
not
afraid
of
them
for
they
cannot
do
evil
neither
also
is
it
in
them
to
do
good
10
6
forasmuch
as
there
is
none
like
unto
thee
o
lord
thou
art
great
and
thy
name
is
great
in
might
10
7
who
would
not
fear
thee
o
king
of
nations
for
to
thee
doth
it
appertain
forasmuch
as
among
all
the
wise
men
of
the
nations
and
in
all
their
kingdoms
there
is
none
like
unto
thee
10
8
but
they
are
altogether
brutish
and
foolish
the
stock
is
a
doctrine
of
vanities
10
9
silver
spread
into
plates
is
brought
from
tarshish
and
gold
from
uphaz
the
work
of
the
workman
and
of
the
hands
of
the
founder
blue
and
purple
is
their
clothing
they
are
all
the
work
of
cunning
men
10
10
but
the
lord
is
the
true
god
he
is
the
living
god
and
an
everlasting
king
at
his
wrath
the
earth
shall
tremble
and
the
nations
shall
not
be
able
to
abide
his
indignation
10
11
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
them
the
gods
that
have
not
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
even
they
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
from
under
these
heavens
10
12
he
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
his
discretion
10
13
when
he
uttereth
his
voice
there
is
a
multitude
of
waters
in
the
heavens
and
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain
and
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures
10
14
every
man
is
brutish
in
his
knowledge
every
founder
is
confounded
by
the
graven
image
for
his
molten
image
is
falsehood
and
there
is
no
breath
in
them
10
15
they
are
vanity
and
the
work
of
errors
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
perish
10
16
the
portion
of
jacob
is
not
like
them
for
he
is
the
former
of
all
things
and
israel
is
the
rod
of
his
inheritance
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
10
17
gather
up
thy
wares
out
of
the
land
o
inhabitant
of
the
fortress
10
18
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
sling
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
at
this
once
and
will
distress
them
that
they
may
find
it
so
10
19
woe
is
me
for
my
hurt
my
wound
is
grievous
but
i
said
truly
this
is
a
grief
and
i
must
bear
it
10
20
my
tabernacle
is
spoiled
and
all
my
cords
are
broken
my
children
are
gone
forth
of
me
and
they
are
not
there
is
none
to
stretch
forth
my
tent
any
more
and
to
set
up
my
curtains
10
21
for
the
pastors
are
become
brutish
and
have
not
sought
the
lord
therefore
they
shall
not
prosper
and
all
their
flocks
shall
be
scattered
10
22
behold
the
noise
of
the
bruit
is
come
and
a
great
commotion
out
of
the
north
country
to
make
the
cities
of
judah
desolate
and
a
den
of
dragons
10
23
o
lord
i
know
that
the
way
of
man
is
not
in
himself
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
steps
10
24
o
lord
correct
me
but
with
judgment
not
in
thine
anger
lest
thou
bring
me
to
nothing
10
25
pour
out
thy
fury
upon
the
heathen
that
know
thee
not
and
upon
the
families
that
call
not
on
thy
name
for
they
have
eaten
up
jacob
and
devoured
him
and
consumed
him
and
have
made
his
habitation
desolate
11
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
11
2
hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
speak
unto
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
11
3
and
say
thou
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
cursed
be
the
man
that
obeyeth
not
the
words
of
this
covenant
11
4
which
i
commanded
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
iron
furnace
saying
obey
my
voice
and
do
them
according
to
all
which
i
command
you
so
shall
ye
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
11
5
that
i
may
perform
the
oath
which
i
have
sworn
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
as
it
is
this
day
then
answered
i
and
said
so
be
it
o
lord
11
6
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
proclaim
all
these
words
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
do
them
11
7
for
i
earnestly
protested
unto
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
rising
early
and
protesting
saying
obey
my
voice
11
8
yet
they
obeyed
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
every
one
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
therefore
i
will
bring
upon
them
all
the
words
of
this
covenant
which
i
commanded
them
to
do
but
they
did
them
not
11
9
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
a
conspiracy
is
found
among
the
men
of
judah
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
11
10
they
are
turned
back
to
the
iniquities
of
their
forefathers
which
refused
to
hear
my
words
and
they
went
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
have
broken
my
covenant
which
i
made
with
their
fathers
11
11
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
which
they
shall
not
be
able
to
escape
and
though
they
shall
cry
unto
me
i
will
not
hearken
unto
them
11
12
then
shall
the
cities
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
unto
whom
they
offer
incense
but
they
shall
not
save
them
at
all
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
11
13
for
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
were
thy
gods
o
judah
and
according
to
the
number
of
the
streets
of
jerusalem
have
ye
set
up
altars
to
that
shameful
thing
even
altars
to
burn
incense
unto
baal
11
14
therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
up
a
cry
or
prayer
for
them
for
i
will
not
hear
them
in
the
time
that
they
cry
unto
me
for
their
trouble
11
15
what
hath
my
beloved
to
do
in
mine
house
seeing
she
hath
wrought
lewdness
with
many
and
the
holy
flesh
is
passed
from
thee
when
thou
doest
evil
then
thou
rejoicest
11
16
the
lord
called
thy
name
a
green
olive
tree
fair
and
of
goodly
fruit
with
the
noise
of
a
great
tumult
he
hath
kindled
fire
upon
it
and
the
branches
of
it
are
broken
11
17
for
the
lord
of
hosts
that
planted
thee
hath
pronounced
evil
against
thee
for
the
evil
of
the
house
of
israel
and
of
the
house
of
judah
which
they
have
done
against
themselves
to
provoke
me
to
anger
in
offering
incense
unto
baal
11
18
and
the
lord
hath
given
me
knowledge
of
it
and
i
know
it
then
thou
shewedst
me
their
doings
11
19
but
i
was
like
a
lamb
or
an
ox
that
is
brought
to
the
slaughter
and
i
knew
not
that
they
had
devised
devices
against
me
saying
let
us
destroy
the
tree
with
the
fruit
thereof
and
let
us
cut
him
off
from
the
land
of
the
living
that
his
name
may
be
no
more
remembered
11
20
but
o
lord
of
hosts
that
judgest
righteously
that
triest
the
reins
and
the
heart
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them
for
unto
thee
have
i
revealed
my
cause
11
21
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
the
men
of
anathoth
that
seek
thy
life
saying
prophesy
not
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
thou
die
not
by
our
hand
11
22
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
punish
them
the
young
men
shall
die
by
the
sword
their
sons
and
their
daughters
shall
die
by
famine
11
23
and
there
shall
be
no
remnant
of
them
for
i
will
bring
evil
upon
the
men
of
anathoth
even
the
year
of
their
visitation
12
1
righteous
art
thou
o
lord
when
i
plead
with
thee
yet
let
me
talk
with
thee
of
thy
judgments
wherefore
doth
the
way
of
the
wicked
prosper
wherefore
are
all
they
happy
that
deal
very
treacherously
12
2
thou
hast
planted
them
yea
they
have
taken
root
they
grow
yea
they
bring
forth
fruit
thou
art
near
in
their
mouth
and
far
from
their
reins
12
3
but
thou
o
lord
knowest
me
thou
hast
seen
me
and
tried
mine
heart
toward
thee
pull
them
out
like
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
prepare
them
for
the
day
of
slaughter
12
4
how
long
shall
the
land
mourn
and
the
herbs
of
every
field
wither
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein
the
beasts
are
consumed
and
the
birds
because
they
said
he
shall
not
see
our
last
end
12
5
if
thou
hast
run
with
the
footmen
and
they
have
wearied
thee
then
how
canst
thou
contend
with
horses
and
if
in
the
land
of
peace
wherein
thou
trustedst
they
wearied
thee
then
how
wilt
thou
do
in
the
swelling
of
jordan
12
6
for
even
thy
brethren
and
the
house
of
thy
father
even
they
have
dealt
treacherously
with
thee
yea
they
have
called
a
multitude
after
thee
believe
them
not
though
they
speak
fair
words
unto
thee
12
7
i
have
forsaken
mine
house
i
have
left
mine
heritage
i
have
given
the
dearly
beloved
of
my
soul
into
the
hand
of
her
enemies
12
8
mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
lion
in
the
forest
it
crieth
out
against
me
therefore
have
i
hated
it
12
9
mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
speckled
bird
the
birds
round
about
are
against
her
come
ye
assemble
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
come
to
devour
12
10
many
pastors
have
destroyed
my
vineyard
they
have
trodden
my
portion
under
foot
they
have
made
my
pleasant
portion
a
desolate
wilderness
12
11
they
have
made
it
desolate
and
being
desolate
it
mourneth
unto
me
the
whole
land
is
made
desolate
because
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart
12
12
the
spoilers
are
come
upon
all
high
places
through
the
wilderness
for
the
sword
of
the
lord
shall
devour
from
the
one
end
of
the
land
even
to
the
other
end
of
the
land
no
flesh
shall
have
peace
12
13
they
have
sown
wheat
but
shall
reap
thorns
they
have
put
themselves
to
pain
but
shall
not
profit
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
your
revenues
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
12
14
thus
saith
the
lord
against
all
mine
evil
neighbours
that
touch
the
inheritance
which
i
have
caused
my
people
israel
to
inherit
behold
i
will
pluck
them
out
of
their
land
and
pluck
out
the
house
of
judah
from
among
them
12
15
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
after
that
i
have
plucked
them
out
i
will
return
and
have
compassion
on
them
and
will
bring
them
again
every
man
to
his
heritage
and
every
man
to
his
land
12
16
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
to
swear
by
my
name
the
lord
liveth
as
they
taught
my
people
to
swear
by
baal
then
shall
they
be
built
in
the
midst
of
my
people
12
17
but
if
they
will
not
obey
i
will
utterly
pluck
up
and
destroy
that
nation
saith
the
lord
13
1
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
me
go
and
get
thee
a
linen
girdle
and
put
it
upon
thy
loins
and
put
it
not
in
water
13
2
so
i
got
a
girdle
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
put
it
on
my
loins
13
3
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
the
second
time
saying
13
4
take
the
girdle
that
thou
hast
got
which
is
upon
thy
loins
and
arise
go
to
euphrates
and
hide
it
there
in
a
hole
of
the
rock
13
5
so
i
went
and
hid
it
by
euphrates
as
the
lord
commanded
me
13
6
and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
go
to
euphrates
and
take
the
girdle
from
thence
which
i
commanded
thee
to
hide
there
13
7
then
i
went
to
euphrates
and
digged
and
took
the
girdle
from
the
place
where
i
had
hid
it
and
behold
the
girdle
was
marred
it
was
profitable
for
nothing
13
8
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
13
9
thus
saith
the
lord
after
this
manner
will
i
mar
the
pride
of
judah
and
the
great
pride
of
jerusalem
13
10
this
evil
people
which
refuse
to
hear
my
words
which
walk
in
the
imagination
of
their
heart
and
walk
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
worship
them
shall
even
be
as
this
girdle
which
is
good
for
nothing
13
11
for
as
the
girdle
cleaveth
to
the
loins
of
a
man
so
have
i
caused
to
cleave
unto
me
the
whole
house
of
israel
and
the
whole
house
of
judah
saith
the
lord
that
they
might
be
unto
me
for
a
people
and
for
a
name
and
for
a
praise
and
for
a
glory
but
they
would
not
hear
13
12
therefore
thou
shalt
speak
unto
them
this
word
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
do
we
not
certainly
know
that
every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine
13
13
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
fill
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
even
the
kings
that
sit
upon
david’s
throne
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
with
drunkenness
13
14
and
i
will
dash
them
one
against
another
even
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
pity
nor
spare
nor
have
mercy
but
destroy
them
13
15
hear
ye
and
give
ear
be
not
proud
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
13
16
give
glory
to
the
lord
your
god
before
he
cause
darkness
and
before
your
feet
stumble
upon
the
dark
mountains
and
while
ye
look
for
light
he
turn
it
into
the
shadow
of
death
and
make
it
gross
darkness
13
17
but
if
ye
will
not
hear
it
my
soul
shall
weep
in
secret
places
for
your
pride
and
mine
eye
shall
weep
sore
and
run
down
with
tears
because
the
lord’s
flock
is
carried
away
captive
13
18
say
unto
the
king
and
to
the
queen
humble
yourselves
sit
down
for
your
principalities
shall
come
down
even
the
crown
of
your
glory
13
19
the
cities
of
the
south
shall
be
shut
up
and
none
shall
open
them
judah
shall
be
carried
away
captive
all
of
it
it
shall
be
wholly
carried
away
captive
13
20
lift
up
your
eyes
and
behold
them
that
come
from
the
north
where
is
the
flock
that
was
given
thee
thy
beautiful
flock
13
21
what
wilt
thou
say
when
he
shall
punish
thee
for
thou
hast
taught
them
to
be
captains
and
as
chief
over
thee
shall
not
sorrows
take
thee
as
a
woman
in
travail
13
22
and
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart
wherefore
come
these
things
upon
me
for
the
greatness
of
thine
iniquity
are
thy
skirts
discovered
and
thy
heels
made
bare
13
23
can
the
ethiopian
change
his
skin
or
the
leopard
his
spots
then
may
ye
also
do
good
that
are
accustomed
to
do
evil
13
24
therefore
will
i
scatter
them
as
the
stubble
that
passeth
away
by
the
wind
of
the
wilderness
13
25
this
is
thy
lot
the
portion
of
thy
measures
from
me
saith
the
lord
because
thou
hast
forgotten
me
and
trusted
in
falsehood
13
26
therefore
will
i
discover
thy
skirts
upon
thy
face
that
thy
shame
may
appear
13
27
i
have
seen
thine
adulteries
and
thy
neighings
the
lewdness
of
thy
whoredom
and
thine
abominations
on
the
hills
in
the
fields
woe
unto
thee
o
jerusalem
wilt
thou
not
be
made
clean
when
shall
it
once
be
14
1
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
the
dearth
14
2
judah
mourneth
and
the
gates
thereof
languish
they
are
black
unto
the
ground
and
the
cry
of
jerusalem
is
gone
up
14
3
and
their
nobles
have
sent
their
little
ones
to
the
waters
they
came
to
the
pits
and
found
no
water
they
returned
with
their
vessels
empty
they
were
ashamed
and
confounded
and
covered
their
heads
14
4
because
the
ground
is
chapt
for
there
was
no
rain
in
the
earth
the
plowmen
were
ashamed
they
covered
their
heads
14
5
yea
the
hind
also
calved
in
the
field
and
forsook
it
because
there
was
no
grass
14
6
and
the
wild
asses
did
stand
in
the
high
places
they
snuffed
up
the
wind
like
dragons
their
eyes
did
fail
because
there
was
no
grass
14
7
o
lord
though
our
iniquities
testify
against
us
do
thou
it
for
thy
name’s
sake
for
our
backslidings
are
many
we
have
sinned
against
thee
14
8
o
the
hope
of
israel
the
saviour
thereof
in
time
of
trouble
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
as
a
wayfaring
man
that
turneth
aside
to
tarry
for
a
night
14
9
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
man
astonied
as
a
mighty
man
that
cannot
save
yet
thou
o
lord
art
in
the
midst
of
us
and
we
are
called
by
thy
name
leave
us
not
14
10
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
this
people
thus
have
they
loved
to
wander
they
have
not
refrained
their
feet
therefore
the
lord
doth
not
accept
them
he
will
now
remember
their
iniquity
and
visit
their
sins
14
11
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
pray
not
for
this
people
for
their
good
14
12
when
they
fast
i
will
not
hear
their
cry
and
when
they
offer
burnt
offering
and
an
oblation
i
will
not
accept
them
but
i
will
consume
them
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
14
13
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
the
prophets
say
unto
them
ye
shall
not
see
the
sword
neither
shall
ye
have
famine
but
i
will
give
you
assured
peace
in
this
place
14
14
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
the
prophets
prophesy
lies
in
my
name
i
sent
them
not
neither
have
i
commanded
them
neither
spake
unto
them
they
prophesy
unto
you
a
false
vision
and
divination
and
a
thing
of
nought
and
the
deceit
of
their
heart
14
15
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
prophets
that
prophesy
in
my
name
and
i
sent
them
not
yet
they
say
sword
and
famine
shall
not
be
in
this
land
by
sword
and
famine
shall
those
prophets
be
consumed
14
16
and
the
people
to
whom
they
prophesy
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
because
of
the
famine
and
the
sword
and
they
shall
have
none
to
bury
them
them
their
wives
nor
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
for
i
will
pour
their
wickedness
upon
them
14
17
therefore
thou
shalt
say
this
word
unto
them
let
mine
eyes
run
down
with
tears
night
and
day
and
let
them
not
cease
for
the
virgin
daughter
of
my
people
is
broken
with
a
great
breach
with
a
very
grievous
blow
14
18
if
i
go
forth
into
the
field
then
behold
the
slain
with
the
sword
and
if
i
enter
into
the
city
then
behold
them
that
are
sick
with
famine
yea
both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
go
about
into
a
land
that
they
know
not
14
19
hast
thou
utterly
rejected
judah
hath
thy
soul
lothed
zion
why
hast
thou
smitten
us
and
there
is
no
healing
for
us
we
looked
for
peace
and
there
is
no
good
and
for
the
time
of
healing
and
behold
trouble
14
20
we
acknowledge
o
lord
our
wickedness
and
the
iniquity
of
our
fathers
for
we
have
sinned
against
thee
14
21
do
not
abhor
us
for
thy
name’s
sake
do
not
disgrace
the
throne
of
thy
glory
remember
break
not
thy
covenant
with
us
14
22
are
there
any
among
the
vanities
of
the
gentiles
that
can
cause
rain
or
can
the
heavens
give
showers
art
not
thou
he
o
lord
our
god
therefore
we
will
wait
upon
thee
for
thou
hast
made
all
these
things
15
1
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
though
moses
and
samuel
stood
before
me
yet
my
mind
could
not
be
toward
this
people
cast
them
out
of
my
sight
and
let
them
go
forth
15
2
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
say
unto
thee
whither
shall
we
go
forth
then
thou
shalt
tell
them
thus
saith
the
lord
such
as
are
for
death
to
death
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword
to
the
sword
and
such
as
are
for
the
famine
to
the
famine
and
such
as
are
for
the
captivity
to
the
captivity
15
3
and
i
will
appoint
over
them
four
kinds
saith
the
lord
the
sword
to
slay
and
the
dogs
to
tear
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
the
beasts
of
the
earth
to
devour
and
destroy
15
4
and
i
will
cause
them
to
be
removed
into
all
kingdoms
of
the
earth
because
of
manasseh
the
son
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
for
that
which
he
did
in
jerusalem
15
5
for
who
shall
have
pity
upon
thee
o
jerusalem
or
who
shall
bemoan
thee
or
who
shall
go
aside
to
ask
how
thou
doest
15
6
thou
hast
forsaken
me
saith
the
lord
thou
art
gone
backward
therefore
will
i
stretch
out
my
hand
against
thee
and
destroy
thee
i
am
weary
with
repenting
15
7
and
i
will
fan
them
with
a
fan
in
the
gates
of
the
land
i
will
bereave
them
of
children
i
will
destroy
my
people
since
they
return
not
from
their
ways
15
8
their
widows
are
increased
to
me
above
the
sand
of
the
seas
i
have
brought
upon
them
against
the
mother
of
the
young
men
a
spoiler
at
noonday
i
have
caused
him
to
fall
upon
it
suddenly
and
terrors
upon
the
city
15
9
she
that
hath
borne
seven
languisheth
she
hath
given
up
the
ghost
her
sun
is
gone
down
while
it
was
yet
day
she
hath
been
ashamed
and
confounded
and
the
residue
of
them
will
i
deliver
to
the
sword
before
their
enemies
saith
the
lord
15
10
woe
is
me
my
mother
that
thou
hast
borne
me
a
man
of
strife
and
a
man
of
contention
to
the
whole
earth
i
have
neither
lent
on
usury
nor
men
have
lent
to
me
on
usury
yet
every
one
of
them
doth
curse
me
15
11
the
lord
said
verily
it
shall
be
well
with
thy
remnant
verily
i
will
cause
the
enemy
to
entreat
thee
well
in
the
time
of
evil
and
in
the
time
of
affliction
15
12
shall
iron
break
the
northern
iron
and
the
steel
15
13
thy
substance
and
thy
treasures
will
i
give
to
the
spoil
without
price
and
that
for
all
thy
sins
even
in
all
thy
borders
15
14
and
i
will
make
thee
to
pass
with
thine
enemies
into
a
land
which
thou
knowest
not
for
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger
which
shall
burn
upon
you
15
15
o
lord
thou
knowest
remember
me
and
visit
me
and
revenge
me
of
my
persecutors
take
me
not
away
in
thy
longsuffering
know
that
for
thy
sake
i
have
suffered
rebuke
15
16
thy
words
were
found
and
i
did
eat
them
and
thy
word
was
unto
me
the
joy
and
rejoicing
of
mine
heart
for
i
am
called
by
thy
name
o
lord
god
of
hosts
15
17
i
sat
not
in
the
assembly
of
the
mockers
nor
rejoiced
i
sat
alone
because
of
thy
hand
for
thou
hast
filled
me
with
indignation
15
18
why
is
my
pain
perpetual
and
my
wound
incurable
which
refuseth
to
be
healed
wilt
thou
be
altogether
unto
me
as
a
liar
and
as
waters
that
fail
15
19
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
if
thou
return
then
will
i
bring
thee
again
and
thou
shalt
stand
before
me
and
if
thou
take
forth
the
precious
from
the
vile
thou
shalt
be
as
my
mouth
let
them
return
unto
thee
but
return
not
thou
unto
them
15
20
and
i
will
make
thee
unto
this
people
a
fenced
brasen
wall
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
i
am
with
thee
to
save
thee
and
to
deliver
thee
saith
the
lord
15
21
and
i
will
deliver
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
and
i
will
redeem
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
terrible
16
1
the
word
of
the
lord
came
also
unto
me
saying
16
2
thou
shalt
not
take
thee
a
wife
neither
shalt
thou
have
sons
or
daughters
in
this
place
16
3
for
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
sons
and
concerning
the
daughters
that
are
born
in
this
place
and
concerning
their
mothers
that
bare
them
and
concerning
their
fathers
that
begat
them
in
this
land
16
4
they
shall
die
of
grievous
deaths
they
shall
not
be
lamented
neither
shall
they
be
buried
but
they
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
famine
and
their
carcases
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
16
5
for
thus
saith
the
lord
enter
not
into
the
house
of
mourning
neither
go
to
lament
nor
bemoan
them
for
i
have
taken
away
my
peace
from
this
people
saith
the
lord
even
lovingkindness
and
mercies
16
6
both
the
great
and
the
small
shall
die
in
this
land
they
shall
not
be
buried
neither
shall
men
lament
for
them
nor
cut
themselves
nor
make
themselves
bald
for
them
16
7
neither
shall
men
tear
themselves
for
them
in
mourning
to
comfort
them
for
the
dead
neither
shall
men
give
them
the
cup
of
consolation
to
drink
for
their
father
or
for
their
mother
16
8
thou
shalt
not
also
go
into
the
house
of
feasting
to
sit
with
them
to
eat
and
to
drink
16
9
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
cause
to
cease
out
of
this
place
in
your
eyes
and
in
your
days
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
16
10
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
shalt
shew
this
people
all
these
words
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
wherefore
hath
the
lord
pronounced
all
this
great
evil
against
us
or
what
is
our
iniquity
or
what
is
our
sin
that
we
have
committed
against
the
lord
our
god
16
11
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
because
your
fathers
have
forsaken
me
saith
the
lord
and
have
walked
after
other
gods
and
have
served
them
and
have
worshipped
them
and
have
forsaken
me
and
have
not
kept
my
law
16
12
and
ye
have
done
worse
than
your
fathers
for
behold
ye
walk
every
one
after
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart
that
they
may
not
hearken
unto
me
16
13
therefore
will
i
cast
you
out
of
this
land
into
a
land
that
ye
know
not
neither
ye
nor
your
fathers
and
there
shall
ye
serve
other
gods
day
and
night
where
i
will
not
shew
you
favour
16
14
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
it
shall
no
more
be
said
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
16
15
but
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
from
the
land
of
the
north
and
from
all
the
lands
whither
he
had
driven
them
and
i
will
bring
them
again
into
their
land
that
i
gave
unto
their
fathers
16
16
behold
i
will
send
for
many
fishers
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
fish
them
and
after
will
i
send
for
many
hunters
and
they
shall
hunt
them
from
every
mountain
and
from
every
hill
and
out
of
the
holes
of
the
rocks
16
17
for
mine
eyes
are
upon
all
their
ways
they
are
not
hid
from
my
face
neither
is
their
iniquity
hid
from
mine
eyes
16
18
and
first
i
will
recompense
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
double
because
they
have
defiled
my
land
they
have
filled
mine
inheritance
with
the
carcases
of
their
detestable
and
abominable
things
16
19
o
lord
my
strength
and
my
fortress
and
my
refuge
in
the
day
of
affliction
the
gentiles
shall
come
unto
thee
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
shall
say
surely
our
fathers
have
inherited
lies
vanity
and
things
wherein
there
is
no
profit
16
20
shall
a
man
make
gods
unto
himself
and
they
are
no
gods
16
21
therefore
behold
i
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know
i
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand
and
my
might
and
they
shall
know
that
my
name
is
the
lord
17
1
the
sin
of
judah
is
written
with
a
pen
of
iron
and
with
the
point
of
a
diamond
it
is
graven
upon
the
table
of
their
heart
and
upon
the
horns
of
your
altars
17
2
whilst
their
children
remember
their
altars
and
their
groves
by
the
green
trees
upon
the
high
hills
17
3
o
my
mountain
in
the
field
i
will
give
thy
substance
and
all
thy
treasures
to
the
spoil
and
thy
high
places
for
sin
throughout
all
thy
borders
17
4
and
thou
even
thyself
shalt
discontinue
from
thine
heritage
that
i
gave
thee
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
serve
thine
enemies
in
the
land
which
thou
knowest
not
for
ye
have
kindled
a
fire
in
mine
anger
which
shall
burn
for
ever
17
5
thus
saith
the
lord
cursed
be
the
man
that
trusteth
in
man
and
maketh
flesh
his
arm
and
whose
heart
departeth
from
the
lord
17
6
for
he
shall
be
like
the
heath
in
the
desert
and
shall
not
see
when
good
cometh
but
shall
inhabit
the
parched
places
in
the
wilderness
in
a
salt
land
and
not
inhabited
17
7
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
the
lord
and
whose
hope
the
lord
is
17
8
for
he
shall
be
as
a
tree
planted
by
the
waters
and
that
spreadeth
out
her
roots
by
the
river
and
shall
not
see
when
heat
cometh
but
her
leaf
shall
be
green
and
shall
not
be
careful
in
the
year
of
drought
neither
shall
cease
from
yielding
fruit
17
9
the
heart
is
deceitful
above
all
things
and
desperately
wicked
who
can
know
it
17
10
i
the
lord
search
the
heart
i
try
the
reins
even
to
give
every
man
according
to
his
ways
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings
17
11
as
the
partridge
sitteth
on
eggs
and
hatcheth
them
not
so
he
that
getteth
riches
and
not
by
right
shall
leave
them
in
the
midst
of
his
days
and
at
his
end
shall
be
a
fool
17
12
a
glorious
high
throne
from
the
beginning
is
the
place
of
our
sanctuary
17
13
o
lord
the
hope
of
israel
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth
because
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
the
fountain
of
living
waters
17
14
heal
me
o
lord
and
i
shall
be
healed
save
me
and
i
shall
be
saved
for
thou
art
my
praise
17
15
behold
they
say
unto
me
where
is
the
word
of
the
lord
let
it
come
now
17
16
as
for
me
i
have
not
hastened
from
being
a
pastor
to
follow
thee
neither
have
i
desired
the
woeful
day
thou
knowest
that
which
came
out
of
my
lips
was
right
before
thee
17
17
be
not
a
terror
unto
me
thou
art
my
hope
in
the
day
of
evil
17
18
let
them
be
confounded
that
persecute
me
but
let
not
me
be
confounded
let
them
be
dismayed
but
let
not
me
be
dismayed
bring
upon
them
the
day
of
evil
and
destroy
them
with
double
destruction
17
19
thus
said
the
lord
unto
me
go
and
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
children
of
the
people
whereby
the
kings
of
judah
come
in
and
by
the
which
they
go
out
and
in
all
the
gates
of
jerusalem
17
20
and
say
unto
them
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
kings
of
judah
and
all
judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
that
enter
in
by
these
gates
17
21
thus
saith
the
lord
take
heed
to
yourselves
and
bear
no
burden
on
the
sabbath
day
nor
bring
it
in
by
the
gates
of
jerusalem
17
22
neither
carry
forth
a
burden
out
of
your
houses
on
the
sabbath
day
neither
do
ye
any
work
but
hallow
ye
the
sabbath
day
as
i
commanded
your
fathers
17
23
but
they
obeyed
not
neither
inclined
their
ear
but
made
their
neck
stiff
that
they
might
not
hear
nor
receive
instruction
17
24
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
diligently
hearken
unto
me
saith
the
lord
to
bring
in
no
burden
through
the
gates
of
this
city
on
the
sabbath
day
but
hallow
the
sabbath
day
to
do
no
work
therein
17
25
then
shall
there
enter
into
the
gates
of
this
city
kings
and
princes
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses
they
and
their
princes
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
this
city
shall
remain
for
ever
17
26
and
they
shall
come
from
the
cities
of
judah
and
from
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
from
the
land
of
benjamin
and
from
the
plain
and
from
the
mountains
and
from
the
south
bringing
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
and
meat
offerings
and
incense
and
bringing
sacrifices
of
praise
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
17
27
but
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
to
hallow
the
sabbath
day
and
not
to
bear
a
burden
even
entering
in
at
the
gates
of
jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day
then
will
i
kindle
a
fire
in
the
gates
thereof
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
of
jerusalem
and
it
shall
not
be
quenched
18
1
the
word
which
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
18
2
arise
and
go
down
to
the
potter’s
house
and
there
i
will
cause
thee
to
hear
my
words
18
3
then
i
went
down
to
the
potter’s
house
and
behold
he
wrought
a
work
on
the
wheels
18
4
and
the
vessel
that
he
made
of
clay
was
marred
in
the
hand
of
the
potter
so
he
made
it
again
another
vessel
as
seemed
good
to
the
potter
to
make
it
18
5
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
18
6
o
house
of
israel
cannot
i
do
with
you
as
this
potter
saith
the
lord
behold
as
the
clay
is
in
the
potter’s
hand
so
are
ye
in
mine
hand
o
house
of
israel
18
7
at
what
instant
i
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation
and
concerning
a
kingdom
to
pluck
up
and
to
pull
down
and
to
destroy
it
18
8
if
that
nation
against
whom
i
have
pronounced
turn
from
their
evil
i
will
repent
of
the
evil
that
i
thought
to
do
unto
them
18
9
and
at
what
instant
i
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation
and
concerning
a
kingdom
to
build
and
to
plant
it
18
10
if
it
do
evil
in
my
sight
that
it
obey
not
my
voice
then
i
will
repent
of
the
good
wherewith
i
said
i
would
benefit
them
18
11
now
therefore
go
to
speak
to
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
frame
evil
against
you
and
devise
a
device
against
you
return
ye
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
make
your
ways
and
your
doings
good
18
12
and
they
said
there
is
no
hope
but
we
will
walk
after
our
own
devices
and
we
will
every
one
do
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart
18
13
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
ask
ye
now
among
the
heathen
who
hath
heard
such
things
the
virgin
of
israel
hath
done
a
very
horrible
thing
18
14
will
a
man
leave
the
snow
of
lebanon
which
cometh
from
the
rock
of
the
field
or
shall
the
cold
flowing
waters
that
come
from
another
place
be
forsaken
18
15
because
my
people
hath
forgotten
me
they
have
burned
incense
to
vanity
and
they
have
caused
them
to
stumble
in
their
ways
from
the
ancient
paths
to
walk
in
paths
in
a
way
not
cast
up
18
16
to
make
their
land
desolate
and
a
perpetual
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished
and
wag
his
head
18
17
i
will
scatter
them
as
with
an
east
wind
before
the
enemy
i
will
shew
them
the
back
and
not
the
face
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
18
18
then
said
they
come
and
let
us
devise
devices
against
jeremiah
for
the
law
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest
nor
counsel
from
the
wise
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet
come
and
let
us
smite
him
with
the
tongue
and
let
us
not
give
heed
to
any
of
his
words
18
19
give
heed
to
me
o
lord
and
hearken
to
the
voice
of
them
that
contend
with
me
18
20
shall
evil
be
recompensed
for
good
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
for
my
soul
remember
that
i
stood
before
thee
to
speak
good
for
them
and
to
turn
away
thy
wrath
from
them
18
21
therefore
deliver
up
their
children
to
the
famine
and
pour
out
their
blood
by
the
force
of
the
sword
and
let
their
wives
be
bereaved
of
their
children
and
be
widows
and
let
their
men
be
put
to
death
let
their
young
men
be
slain
by
the
sword
in
battle
18
22
let
a
cry
be
heard
from
their
houses
when
thou
shalt
bring
a
troop
suddenly
upon
them
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
to
take
me
and
hid
snares
for
my
feet
18
23
yet
lord
thou
knowest
all
their
counsel
against
me
to
slay
me
forgive
not
their
iniquity
neither
blot
out
their
sin
from
thy
sight
but
let
them
be
overthrown
before
thee
deal
thus
with
them
in
the
time
of
thine
anger
19
1
thus
saith
the
lord
go
and
get
a
potter’s
earthen
bottle
and
take
of
the
ancients
of
the
people
and
of
the
ancients
of
the
priests
19
2
and
go
forth
unto
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
which
is
by
the
entry
of
the
east
gate
and
proclaim
there
the
words
that
i
shall
tell
thee
19
3
and
say
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
o
kings
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
the
which
whosoever
heareth
his
ears
shall
tingle
19
4
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
estranged
this
place
and
have
burned
incense
in
it
unto
other
gods
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known
nor
the
kings
of
judah
and
have
filled
this
place
with
the
blood
of
innocents
19
5
they
have
built
also
the
high
places
of
baal
to
burn
their
sons
with
fire
for
burnt
offerings
unto
baal
which
i
commanded
not
nor
spake
it
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
19
6
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
this
place
shall
no
more
be
called
tophet
nor
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
but
the
valley
of
slaughter
19
7
and
i
will
make
void
the
counsel
of
judah
and
jerusalem
in
this
place
and
i
will
cause
them
to
fall
by
the
sword
before
their
enemies
and
by
the
hands
of
them
that
seek
their
lives
and
their
carcases
will
i
give
to
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
19
8
and
i
will
make
this
city
desolate
and
an
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished
and
hiss
because
of
all
the
plagues
thereof
19
9
and
i
will
cause
them
to
eat
the
flesh
of
their
sons
and
the
flesh
of
their
daughters
and
they
shall
eat
every
one
the
flesh
of
his
friend
in
the
siege
and
straitness
wherewith
their
enemies
and
they
that
seek
their
lives
shall
straiten
them
19
10
then
shalt
thou
break
the
bottle
in
the
sight
of
the
men
that
go
with
thee
19
11
and
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
even
so
will
i
break
this
people
and
this
city
as
one
breaketh
a
potter’s
vessel
that
cannot
be
made
whole
again
and
they
shall
bury
them
in
tophet
till
there
be
no
place
to
bury
19
12
thus
will
i
do
unto
this
place
saith
the
lord
and
to
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
even
make
this
city
as
tophet
19
13
and
the
houses
of
jerusalem
and
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
judah
shall
be
defiled
as
the
place
of
tophet
because
of
all
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
burned
incense
unto
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
have
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
19
14
then
came
jeremiah
from
tophet
whither
the
lord
had
sent
him
to
prophesy
and
he
stood
in
the
court
of
the
lord’s
house
and
said
to
all
the
people
19
15
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
upon
this
city
and
upon
all
her
towns
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
it
because
they
have
hardened
their
necks
that
they
might
not
hear
my
words
20
1
now
pashur
the
son
of
immer
the
priest
who
was
also
chief
governor
in
the
house
of
the
lord
heard
that
jeremiah
prophesied
these
things
20
2
then
pashur
smote
jeremiah
the
prophet
and
put
him
in
the
stocks
that
were
in
the
high
gate
of
benjamin
which
was
by
the
house
of
the
lord
20
3
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
pashur
brought
forth
jeremiah
out
of
the
stocks
then
said
jeremiah
unto
him
the
lord
hath
not
called
thy
name
pashur
but
magormissabib
20
4
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
make
thee
a
terror
to
thyself
and
to
all
thy
friends
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
of
their
enemies
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
it
and
i
will
give
all
judah
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
carry
them
captive
into
babylon
and
shall
slay
them
with
the
sword
20
5
moreover
i
will
deliver
all
the
strength
of
this
city
and
all
the
labours
thereof
and
all
the
precious
things
thereof
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
kings
of
judah
will
i
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
which
shall
spoil
them
and
take
them
and
carry
them
to
babylon
20
6
and
thou
pashur
and
all
that
dwell
in
thine
house
shall
go
into
captivity
and
thou
shalt
come
to
babylon
and
there
thou
shalt
die
and
shalt
be
buried
there
thou
and
all
thy
friends
to
whom
thou
hast
prophesied
lies
20
7
o
lord
thou
hast
deceived
me
and
i
was
deceived
thou
art
stronger
than
i
and
hast
prevailed
i
am
in
derision
daily
every
one
mocketh
me
20
8
for
since
i
spake
i
cried
out
i
cried
violence
and
spoil
because
the
word
of
the
lord
was
made
a
reproach
unto
me
and
a
derision
daily
20
9
then
i
said
i
will
not
make
mention
of
him
nor
speak
any
more
in
his
name
but
his
word
was
in
mine
heart
as
a
burning
fire
shut
up
in
my
bones
and
i
was
weary
with
forbearing
and
i
could
not
stay
20
10
for
i
heard
the
defaming
of
many
fear
on
every
side
report
say
they
and
we
will
report
it
all
my
familiars
watched
for
my
halting
saying
peradventure
he
will
be
enticed
and
we
shall
prevail
against
him
and
we
shall
take
our
revenge
on
him
20
11
but
the
lord
is
with
me
as
a
mighty
terrible
one
therefore
my
persecutors
shall
stumble
and
they
shall
not
prevail
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed
for
they
shall
not
prosper
their
everlasting
confusion
shall
never
be
forgotten
20
12
but
o
lord
of
hosts
that
triest
the
righteous
and
seest
the
reins
and
the
heart
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them
for
unto
thee
have
i
opened
my
cause
20
13
sing
unto
the
lord
praise
ye
the
lord
for
he
hath
delivered
the
soul
of
the
poor
from
the
hand
of
evildoers
20
14
cursed
be
the
day
wherein
i
was
born
let
not
the
day
wherein
my
mother
bare
me
be
blessed
20
15
cursed
be
the
man
who
brought
tidings
to
my
father
saying
a
man
child
is
born
unto
thee
making
him
very
glad
20
16
and
let
that
man
be
as
the
cities
which
the
lord
overthrew
and
repented
not
and
let
him
hear
the
cry
in
the
morning
and
the
shouting
at
noontide
20
17
because
he
slew
me
not
from
the
womb
or
that
my
mother
might
have
been
my
grave
and
her
womb
to
be
always
great
with
me
20
18
wherefore
came
i
forth
out
of
the
womb
to
see
labour
and
sorrow
that
my
days
should
be
consumed
with
shame
21
1
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
when
king
zedekiah
sent
unto
him
pashur
the
son
of
melchiah
and
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
saying
21
2
enquire
i
pray
thee
of
the
lord
for
us
for
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
maketh
war
against
us
if
so
be
that
the
lord
will
deal
with
us
according
to
all
his
wondrous
works
that
he
may
go
up
from
us
21
3
then
said
jeremiah
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
to
zedekiah
21
4
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
turn
back
the
weapons
of
war
that
are
in
your
hands
wherewith
ye
fight
against
the
king
of
babylon
and
against
the
chaldeans
which
besiege
you
without
the
walls
and
i
will
assemble
them
into
the
midst
of
this
city
21
5
and
i
myself
will
fight
against
you
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
with
a
strong
arm
even
in
anger
and
in
fury
and
in
great
wrath
21
6
and
i
will
smite
the
inhabitants
of
this
city
both
man
and
beast
they
shall
die
of
a
great
pestilence
21
7
and
afterward
saith
the
lord
i
will
deliver
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
his
servants
and
the
people
and
such
as
are
left
in
this
city
from
the
pestilence
from
the
sword
and
from
the
famine
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
life
and
he
shall
smite
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
he
shall
not
spare
them
neither
have
pity
nor
have
mercy
21
8
and
unto
this
people
thou
shalt
say
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
set
before
you
the
way
of
life
and
the
way
of
death
21
9
he
that
abideth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
but
he
that
goeth
out
and
falleth
to
the
chaldeans
that
besiege
you
he
shall
live
and
his
life
shall
be
unto
him
for
a
prey
21
10
for
i
have
set
my
face
against
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
saith
the
lord
it
shall
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire
21
11
and
touching
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
say
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
21
12
o
house
of
david
thus
saith
the
lord
execute
judgment
in
the
morning
and
deliver
him
that
is
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
lest
my
fury
go
out
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
21
13
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
inhabitant
of
the
valley
and
rock
of
the
plain
saith
the
lord
which
say
who
shall
come
down
against
us
or
who
shall
enter
into
our
habitations
21
14
but
i
will
punish
you
according
to
the
fruit
of
your
doings
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
forest
thereof
and
it
shall
devour
all
things
round
about
it
22
1
thus
saith
the
lord
go
down
to
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
speak
there
this
word
22
2
and
say
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
king
of
judah
that
sittest
upon
the
throne
of
david
thou
and
thy
servants
and
thy
people
that
enter
in
by
these
gates
22
3
thus
saith
the
lord
execute
ye
judgment
and
righteousness
and
deliver
the
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
and
do
no
wrong
do
no
violence
to
the
stranger
the
fatherless
nor
the
widow
neither
shed
innocent
blood
in
this
place
22
4
for
if
ye
do
this
thing
indeed
then
shall
there
enter
in
by
the
gates
of
this
house
kings
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses
he
and
his
servants
and
his
people
22
5
but
if
ye
will
not
hear
these
words
i
swear
by
myself
saith
the
lord
that
this
house
shall
become
a
desolation
22
6
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
king’s
house
of
judah
thou
art
gilead
unto
me
and
the
head
of
lebanon
yet
surely
i
will
make
thee
a
wilderness
and
cities
which
are
not
inhabited
22
7
and
i
will
prepare
destroyers
against
thee
every
one
with
his
weapons
and
they
shall
cut
down
thy
choice
cedars
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
22
8
and
many
nations
shall
pass
by
this
city
and
they
shall
say
every
man
to
his
neighbour
wherefore
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
great
city
22
9
then
they
shall
answer
because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
lord
their
god
and
worshipped
other
gods
and
served
them
22
10
weep
ye
not
for
the
dead
neither
bemoan
him
but
weep
sore
for
him
that
goeth
away
for
he
shall
return
no
more
nor
see
his
native
country
22
11
for
thus
saith
the
lord
touching
shallum
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
which
reigned
instead
of
josiah
his
father
which
went
forth
out
of
this
place
he
shall
not
return
thither
any
more
22
12
but
he
shall
die
in
the
place
whither
they
have
led
him
captive
and
shall
see
this
land
no
more
22
13
woe
unto
him
that
buildeth
his
house
by
unrighteousness
and
his
chambers
by
wrong
that
useth
his
neighbour’s
service
without
wages
and
giveth
him
not
for
his
work
22
14
that
saith
i
will
build
me
a
wide
house
and
large
chambers
and
cutteth
him
out
windows
and
it
is
cieled
with
cedar
and
painted
with
vermilion
22
15
shalt
thou
reign
because
thou
closest
thyself
in
cedar
did
not
thy
father
eat
and
drink
and
do
judgment
and
justice
and
then
it
was
well
with
him
22
16
he
judged
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy
then
it
was
well
with
him
was
not
this
to
know
me
saith
the
lord
22
17
but
thine
eyes
and
thine
heart
are
not
but
for
thy
covetousness
and
for
to
shed
innocent
blood
and
for
oppression
and
for
violence
to
do
it
22
18
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
they
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
ah
my
brother
or
ah
sister
they
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
ah
lord
or
ah
his
glory
22
19
he
shall
be
buried
with
the
burial
of
an
ass
drawn
and
cast
forth
beyond
the
gates
of
jerusalem
22
20
go
up
to
lebanon
and
cry
and
lift
up
thy
voice
in
bashan
and
cry
from
the
passages
for
all
thy
lovers
are
destroyed
22
21
i
spake
unto
thee
in
thy
prosperity
but
thou
saidst
i
will
not
hear
this
hath
been
thy
manner
from
thy
youth
that
thou
obeyedst
not
my
voice
22
22
the
wind
shall
eat
up
all
thy
pastors
and
thy
lovers
shall
go
into
captivity
surely
then
shalt
thou
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
all
thy
wickedness
22
23
o
inhabitant
of
lebanon
that
makest
thy
nest
in
the
cedars
how
gracious
shalt
thou
be
when
pangs
come
upon
thee
the
pain
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
22
24
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
though
coniah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
were
the
signet
upon
my
right
hand
yet
would
i
pluck
thee
thence
22
25
and
i
will
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
thy
life
and
into
the
hand
of
them
whose
face
thou
fearest
even
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
22
26
and
i
will
cast
thee
out
and
thy
mother
that
bare
thee
into
another
country
where
ye
were
not
born
and
there
shall
ye
die
22
27
but
to
the
land
whereunto
they
desire
to
return
thither
shall
they
not
return
22
28
is
this
man
coniah
a
despised
broken
idol
is
he
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
wherefore
are
they
cast
out
he
and
his
seed
and
are
cast
into
a
land
which
they
know
not
22
29
o
earth
earth
earth
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
22
30
thus
saith
the
lord
write
ye
this
man
childless
a
man
that
shall
not
prosper
in
his
days
for
no
man
of
his
seed
shall
prosper
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
ruling
any
more
in
judah
23
1
woe
be
unto
the
pastors
that
destroy
and
scatter
the
sheep
of
my
pasture
saith
the
lord
23
2
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
against
the
pastors
that
feed
my
people
ye
have
scattered
my
flock
and
driven
them
away
and
have
not
visited
them
behold
i
will
visit
upon
you
the
evil
of
your
doings
saith
the
lord
23
3
and
i
will
gather
the
remnant
of
my
flock
out
of
all
countries
whither
i
have
driven
them
and
will
bring
them
again
to
their
folds
and
they
shall
be
fruitful
and
increase
23
4
and
i
will
set
up
shepherds
over
them
which
shall
feed
them
and
they
shall
fear
no
more
nor
be
dismayed
neither
shall
they
be
lacking
saith
the
lord
23
5
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
raise
unto
david
a
righteous
branch
and
a
king
shall
reign
and
prosper
and
shall
execute
judgment
and
justice
in
the
earth
23
6
in
his
days
judah
shall
be
saved
and
israel
shall
dwell
safely
and
this
is
his
name
whereby
he
shall
be
called
the
lord
our
righteousness
23
7
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
they
shall
no
more
say
the
lord
liveth
which
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
23
8
but
the
lord
liveth
which
brought
up
and
which
led
the
seed
of
the
house
of
israel
out
of
the
north
country
and
from
all
countries
whither
i
had
driven
them
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
own
land
23
9
mine
heart
within
me
is
broken
because
of
the
prophets
all
my
bones
shake
i
am
like
a
drunken
man
and
like
a
man
whom
wine
hath
overcome
because
of
the
lord
and
because
of
the
words
of
his
holiness
23
10
for
the
land
is
full
of
adulterers
for
because
of
swearing
the
land
mourneth
the
pleasant
places
of
the
wilderness
are
dried
up
and
their
course
is
evil
and
their
force
is
not
right
23
11
for
both
prophet
and
priest
are
profane
yea
in
my
house
have
i
found
their
wickedness
saith
the
lord
23
12
wherefore
their
way
shall
be
unto
them
as
slippery
ways
in
the
darkness
they
shall
be
driven
on
and
fall
therein
for
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
even
the
year
of
their
visitation
saith
the
lord
23
13
and
i
have
seen
folly
in
the
prophets
of
samaria
they
prophesied
in
baal
and
caused
my
people
israel
to
err
23
14
i
have
seen
also
in
the
prophets
of
jerusalem
an
horrible
thing
they
commit
adultery
and
walk
in
lies
they
strengthen
also
the
hands
of
evildoers
that
none
doth
return
from
his
wickedness
they
are
all
of
them
unto
me
as
sodom
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
as
gomorrah
23
15
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
concerning
the
prophets
behold
i
will
feed
them
with
wormwood
and
make
them
drink
the
water
of
gall
for
from
the
prophets
of
jerusalem
is
profaneness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land
23
16
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
they
make
you
vain
they
speak
a
vision
of
their
own
heart
and
not
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lord
23
17
they
say
still
unto
them
that
despise
me
the
lord
hath
said
ye
shall
have
peace
and
they
say
unto
every
one
that
walketh
after
the
imagination
of
his
own
heart
no
evil
shall
come
upon
you
23
18
for
who
hath
stood
in
the
counsel
of
the
lord
and
hath
perceived
and
heard
his
word
who
hath
marked
his
word
and
heard
it
23
19
behold
a
whirlwind
of
the
lord
is
gone
forth
in
fury
even
a
grievous
whirlwind
it
shall
fall
grievously
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked
23
20
the
anger
of
the
lord
shall
not
return
until
he
have
executed
and
till
he
have
performed
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it
perfectly
23
21
i
have
not
sent
these
prophets
yet
they
ran
i
have
not
spoken
to
them
yet
they
prophesied
23
22
but
if
they
had
stood
in
my
counsel
and
had
caused
my
people
to
hear
my
words
then
they
should
have
turned
them
from
their
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
of
their
doings
23
23
am
i
a
god
at
hand
saith
the
lord
and
not
a
god
afar
off
23
24
can
any
hide
himself
in
secret
places
that
i
shall
not
see
him
saith
the
lord
do
not
i
fill
heaven
and
earth
saith
the
lord
23
25
i
have
heard
what
the
prophets
said
that
prophesy
lies
in
my
name
saying
i
have
dreamed
i
have
dreamed
23
26
how
long
shall
this
be
in
the
heart
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
lies
yea
they
are
prophets
of
the
deceit
of
their
own
heart
23
27
which
think
to
cause
my
people
to
forget
my
name
by
their
dreams
which
they
tell
every
man
to
his
neighbour
as
their
fathers
have
forgotten
my
name
for
baal
23
28
the
prophet
that
hath
a
dream
let
him
tell
a
dream
and
he
that
hath
my
word
let
him
speak
my
word
faithfully
what
is
the
chaff
to
the
wheat
saith
the
lord
23
29
is
not
my
word
like
as
a
fire
saith
the
lord
and
like
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces
23
30
therefore
behold
i
am
against
the
prophets
saith
the
lord
that
steal
my
words
every
one
from
his
neighbour
23
31
behold
i
am
against
the
prophets
saith
the
lord
that
use
their
tongues
and
say
he
saith
23
32
behold
i
am
against
them
that
prophesy
false
dreams
saith
the
lord
and
do
tell
them
and
cause
my
people
to
err
by
their
lies
and
by
their
lightness
yet
i
sent
them
not
nor
commanded
them
therefore
they
shall
not
profit
this
people
at
all
saith
the
lord
23
33
and
when
this
people
or
the
prophet
or
a
priest
shall
ask
thee
saying
what
is
the
burden
of
the
lord
thou
shalt
then
say
unto
them
what
burden
i
will
even
forsake
you
saith
the
lord
23
34
and
as
for
the
prophet
and
the
priest
and
the
people
that
shall
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
i
will
even
punish
that
man
and
his
house
23
35
thus
shall
ye
say
every
one
to
his
neighbour
and
every
one
to
his
brother
what
hath
the
lord
answered
and
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
23
36
and
the
burden
of
the
lord
shall
ye
mention
no
more
for
every
man’s
word
shall
be
his
burden
for
ye
have
perverted
the
words
of
the
living
god
of
the
lord
of
hosts
our
god
23
37
thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
prophet
what
hath
the
lord
answered
thee
and
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
23
38
but
since
ye
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
because
ye
say
this
word
the
burden
of
the
lord
and
i
have
sent
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
23
39
therefore
behold
i
even
i
will
utterly
forget
you
and
i
will
forsake
you
and
the
city
that
i
gave
you
and
your
fathers
and
cast
you
out
of
my
presence
23
40
and
i
will
bring
an
everlasting
reproach
upon
you
and
a
perpetual
shame
which
shall
not
be
forgotten
24
1
the
lord
shewed
me
and
behold
two
baskets
of
figs
were
set
before
the
temple
of
the
lord
after
that
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
captive
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
and
the
princes
of
judah
with
the
carpenters
and
smiths
from
jerusalem
and
had
brought
them
to
babylon
24
2
one
basket
had
very
good
figs
even
like
the
figs
that
are
first
ripe
and
the
other
basket
had
very
naughty
figs
which
could
not
be
eaten
they
were
so
bad
24
3
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
what
seest
thou
jeremiah
and
i
said
figs
the
good
figs
very
good
and
the
evil
very
evil
that
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
24
4
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
24
5
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
like
these
good
figs
so
will
i
acknowledge
them
that
are
carried
away
captive
of
judah
whom
i
have
sent
out
of
this
place
into
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
for
their
good
24
6
for
i
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
good
and
i
will
bring
them
again
to
this
land
and
i
will
build
them
and
not
pull
them
down
and
i
will
plant
them
and
not
pluck
them
up
24
7
and
i
will
give
them
an
heart
to
know
me
that
i
am
the
lord
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
for
they
shall
return
unto
me
with
their
whole
heart
24
8
and
as
the
evil
figs
which
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
surely
thus
saith
the
lord
so
will
i
give
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
and
his
princes
and
the
residue
of
jerusalem
that
remain
in
this
land
and
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
24
9
and
i
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
for
their
hurt
to
be
a
reproach
and
a
proverb
a
taunt
and
a
curse
in
all
places
whither
i
shall
drive
them
24
10
and
i
will
send
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
among
them
till
they
be
consumed
from
off
the
land
that
i
gave
unto
them
and
to
their
fathers
25

the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
all
the
people
of
judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
that
was

year
of

king
of

the
which
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
all
the
people
of
judah
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
saying
25
3
from
the
thirteenth
year
of
josiah
the
son
of
amon
king
of
judah
even
unto
this
day
that
is
the
three
and
twentieth
year
the
word
of
the
lord
hath
come
unto
me
and
i
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
25
4
and
the
lord
hath
sent
unto
you
all
his
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
nor
inclined
your
ear
to
hear
25
5
they
said
turn
ye
again
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
of
your
doings
and
dwell
in
the
land
that
the
lord
hath
given
unto
you
and
to
your
fathers
for
ever
and
ever
25
6
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
worship
them
and
provoke
me
not
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands
and
i
will
do
you
no
hurt
25
7
yet
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me
saith
the
lord
that
ye
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands
to
your
own
hurt
25
8
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
because
ye
have
not
heard
my
words
25
9
behold
i
will
send
and
take
all
the
families
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
and
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
bring
them
against
this
land
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
against
all
these
nations
round
about
and
will
utterly
destroy
them
and
make
them
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
and
perpetual
desolations
25
10
moreover
i
will
take
from
them
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
sound
of
the
millstones
and
the
light
of
the
candle
25
11
and
this
whole
land
shall
be
a
desolation
and
an
astonishment
and
these
nations
shall
serve
the
king
of
babylon
seventy
years
25
12
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
seventy
years
are
accomplished
that
i
will
punish
the
king
of
babylon
and
that
nation
saith
the
lord
for
their
iniquity
and
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
and
will
make
it
perpetual
desolations
25
13
and
i
will
bring
upon
that
land
all
my
words
which
i
have
pronounced
against
it
even
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
which
jeremiah
hath
prophesied
against
all
the
nations
25
14
for
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
them
also
and
i
will
recompense
them
according
to
their
deeds
and
according
to
the
works
of
their
own
hands
25
15
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
unto
me
take
the
wine
cup
of
this
fury
at
my
hand
and
cause
all
the
nations
to
whom
i
send
thee
to
drink
it
25
16
and
they
shall
drink
and
be
moved
and
be
mad
because
of
the
sword
that
i
will
send
among
them
25
17
then
took
i
the
cup
at
the
lord’s
hand
and
made
all
the
nations
to
drink
unto
whom
the
lord
had
sent
me
25
18
to
wit
jerusalem
and
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
kings
thereof
and
the
princes
thereof
to
make
them
a
desolation
an
astonishment
an
hissing
and
a
curse
as
it
is
this
day

19
pharaoh

and
all

which
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
king
of
sheshach
shall
drink
after
them
25
27
therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
drink
ye
and
be
drunken
and
spue
and
fall
and
rise
no
more
because
of
the
sword
which
i
will
send
among
you
25
28
and
it
shall
be
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
cup
at
thine
hand
to
drink
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
ye
shall
certainly
drink
25
29
for
lo
i
begin
to
bring
evil
on
the
city
which
is
called
by
my
name
and
should
ye
be
utterly
unpunished
ye
shall
not
be
unpunished
for
i
will
call
for
a
sword
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
25
30
therefore
prophesy
thou
against
them
all
these
words
and
say
unto
them
the
lord
shall
roar
from
on
high
and
utter
his
voice
from
his
holy
habitation
he
shall
mightily
roar
upon
his
habitation
he
shall
give
a
shout
as
they
that
tread
the
grapes
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
25
31
a
noise
shall
come
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
the
nations
he
will
plead
with
all
flesh
he
will
give
them
that
are
wicked
to
the
sword
saith
the
lord
25
32
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
evil
shall
go
forth
from
nation
to
nation
and
a
great
whirlwind
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
25
33
and
the
slain
of
the
lord
shall
be
at
that
day
from
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth
they
shall
not
be
lamented
neither
gathered
nor
buried
they
shall
be
dung
upon
the
ground
25
34
howl
ye
shepherds
and
cry
and
wallow
yourselves
in
the
ashes
ye
principal
of
the
flock
for
the
days
of
your
slaughter
and
of
your
dispersions
are
accomplished
and
ye
shall
fall
like
a
pleasant
vessel
25
35
and
the
shepherds
shall
have
no
way
to
flee
nor
the
principal
of
the
flock
to
escape
25
36
a
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
shepherds
and
an
howling
of
the
principal
of
the
flock
shall
be
heard
for
the
lord
hath
spoiled
their
pasture
25
37
and
the
peaceable
habitations
are
cut
down
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
25
38
he
hath
forsaken
his
covert
as
the
lion
for
their
land
is
desolate
because
of
the
fierceness
of
the
oppressor
and
because
of
his
fierce
anger
26
1
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
came
this
word
from
the
lord
saying
26
2
thus
saith
the
lord
stand
in
the
court
of
the
lord’s
house
and
speak
unto
all
the
cities
of
judah
which
come
to
worship
in
the
lord’s
house
all
the
words
that
i
command
thee
to
speak
unto
them
diminish
not
a
word
26
3
if
so
be
they
will
hearken
and
turn
every
man
from
his
evil
way
that
i
may
repent
me
of
the
evil
which
i
purpose
to
do
unto
them
because
of
the
evil
of
their
doings
26
4
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
if
ye
will
not
hearken
to
me
to
walk
in
my
law
which
i
have
set
before
you
26
5
to
hearken
to
the
words
of
my
servants
the
prophets
whom
i
sent
unto
you
both
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
26
6
then
will
i
make
this
house
like
shiloh
and
will
make
this
city
a
curse
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
26
7
so
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
the
lord
26
8
now
it
came
to
pass
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
that
the
lord
had
commanded
him
to
speak
unto
all
the
people
that
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
took
him
saying
thou
shalt
surely
die
26
9
why
hast
thou
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
lord
saying
this
house
shall
be
like
shiloh
and
this
city
shall
be
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
and
all
the
people
were
gathered
against
jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
lord
26
10
when
the
princes
of
judah
heard
these
things
then
they
came
up
from
the
king’s
house
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
sat
down
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
26
11
then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
saying
this
man
is
worthy
to
die
for
he
hath
prophesied
against
this
city
as
ye
have
heard
with
your
ears
26
12
then
spake
jeremiah
unto
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
saying
the
lord
sent
me
to
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
ye
have
heard
26
13
therefore
now
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
and
the
lord
will
repent
him
of
the
evil
that
he
hath
pronounced
against
you
26
14
as
for
me
behold
i
am
in
your
hand
do
with
me
as
seemeth
good
and
meet
unto
you
26
15
but
know
ye
for
certain
that
if
ye
put
me
to
death
ye
shall
surely
bring
innocent
blood
upon
yourselves
and
upon
this
city
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
for
of
a
truth
the
lord
hath
sent
me
unto
you
to
speak
all
these
words
in
your
ears
26
16
then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
to
the
prophets
this
man
is
not
worthy
to
die
for
he
hath
spoken
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
our
god
26
17
then
rose
up
certain
of
the
elders
of
the
land
and
spake
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
people
saying
26
18
micah
the
morasthite
prophesied
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
spake
to
all
the
people
of
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
zion
shall
be
plowed
like
a
field
and
jerusalem
shall
become
heaps
and
the
mountain
of
the
house
as
the
high
places
of
a
forest
26
19
did
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
all
judah
put
him
at
all
to
death
did
he
not
fear
the
lord
and
besought
the
lord
and
the
lord
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
pronounced
against
them
thus
might
we
procure
great
evil
against
our
souls
26
20
and
there
was
also
a
man
that
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
lord
urijah
the
son
of
shemaiah
of
kirjathjearim
who
prophesied
against
this
city
and
against
this
land
according
to
all
the
words
of
jeremiah
26
21
and
when
jehoiakim
the
king
with
all
his
mighty
men
and
all
the
princes
heard
his
words
the
king
sought
to
put
him
to
death
but
when
urijah
heard
it
he
was
afraid
and
fled
and
went
into
egypt
26
22
and
jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into
egypt
namely
elnathan
the
son
of
achbor
and
certain
men
with
him
into
egypt
26
23
and
they
fetched
forth
urijah
out
of
egypt
and
brought
him
unto
jehoiakim
the
king
who
slew
him
with
the
sword
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
people
26
24
nevertheless
the
hand
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
was
with
jeremiah
that
they
should
not
give
him
into
the
hand
of
the
people
to
put
him
to
death
27
1
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
came
this
word
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
27
2
thus
saith
the
lord
to
me
make
thee
bonds
and
yokes
and
put
them
upon
thy
neck
27
3
and
send
them
to
the
king
of
edom
and
to
the
king
of
moab
and
to
the
king
of
the
ammonites
and
to
the
king
of
tyrus
and
to
the
king
of
zidon
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
which
come
to
jerusalem
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
27
4
and
command
them
to
say
unto
their
masters
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
masters
27
5
i
have
made
the
earth
the
man
and
the
beast
that
are
upon
the
ground
by
my
great
power
and
by
my
outstretched
arm
and
have
given
it
unto
whom
it
seemed
meet
unto
me
27
6
and
now
have
i
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
have
i
given
him
also
to
serve
him
27
7
and
all
nations
shall
serve
him
and
his
son
and
his
son’s
son
until
the
very
time
of
his
land
come
and
then
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
him
27
8
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
nation
and
kingdom
which
will
not
serve
the
same
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
and
that
will
not
put
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
that
nation
will
i
punish
saith
the
lord
with
the
sword
and
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
until
i
have
consumed
them
by
his
hand
27
9
therefore
hearken
not
ye
to
your
prophets
nor
to
your
diviners
nor
to
your
dreamers
nor
to
your
enchanters
nor
to
your
sorcerers
which
speak
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
27
10
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
to
remove
you
far
from
your
land
and
that
i
should
drive
you
out
and
ye
should
perish
27
11
but
the
nations
that
bring
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
serve
him
those
will
i
let
remain
still
in
their
own
land
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
till
it
and
dwell
therein
27
12
i
spake
also
to
zedekiah
king
of
judah
according
to
all
these
words
saying
bring
your
necks
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
serve
him
and
his
people
and
live
27
13
why
will
ye
die
thou
and
thy
people
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
against
the
nation
that
will
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
27
14
therefore
hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
speak
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
27
15
for
i
have
not
sent
them
saith
the
lord
yet
they
prophesy
a
lie
in
my
name
that
i
might
drive
you
out
and
that
ye
might
perish
ye
and
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
27
16
also
i
spake
to
the
priests
and
to
all
this
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hearken
not
to
the
words
of
your
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
saying
behold
the
vessels
of
the
lord’s
house
shall
now
shortly
be
brought
again
from
babylon
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
27
17
hearken
not
unto
them
serve
the
king
of
babylon
and
live
wherefore
should
this
city
be
laid
waste
27
18
but
if
they
be
prophets
and
if
the
word
of
the
lord
be
with
them
let
them
now
make
intercession
to
the
lord
of
hosts
that
the
vessels
which
are
left
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
at
jerusalem
go
not
to
babylon
27
19
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
concerning
the
pillars
and
concerning
the
sea
and
concerning
the
bases
and
concerning
the
residue
of
the
vessels
that
remain
in
this
city
27
20
which
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
took
not
when
he
carried
away
captive
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
and
all
the
nobles
of
judah
and
jerusalem
27
21
yea
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
concerning
the
vessels
that
remain
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
of
jerusalem
27
22
they
shall
be
carried
to
babylon
and
there
shall
they
be
until
the
day
that
i
visit
them
saith
the
lord
then
will
i
bring
them
up
and
restore
them
to
this
place
28
1
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
year
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
the
fourth
year
and
in
the
fifth
month
that
hananiah
the
son
of
azur
the
prophet
which
was
of
gibeon
spake
unto
me
in
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
of
all
the
people
saying
28
2
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
i
have
broken
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
28
3
within
two
full
years
will
i
bring
again
into
this
place
all
the
vessels
of
the
lord’s
house
that
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
took
away
from
this
place
and
carried
them
to
babylon
28
4
and
i
will
bring
again
to
this
place
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
with
all
the
captives
of
judah
that
went
into
babylon
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
28
5
then
the
prophet
jeremiah
said
unto
the
prophet
hananiah
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
that
stood
in
the
house
of
the
lord
28
6
even
the
prophet
jeremiah
said
amen
the
lord
do
so
the
lord
perform
thy
words
which
thou
hast
prophesied
to
bring
again
the
vessels
of
the
lord’s
house
and
all
that
is
carried
away
captive
from
babylon
into
this
place
28
7
nevertheless
hear
thou
now
this
word
that
i
speak
in
thine
ears
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people
28
8
the
prophets
that
have
been
before
me
and
before
thee
of
old
prophesied
both
against
many
countries
and
against
great
kingdoms
of
war
and
of
evil
and
of
pestilence
28
9
the
prophet
which
prophesieth
of
peace
when
the
word
of
the
prophet
shall
come
to
pass
then
shall
the
prophet
be
known
that
the
lord
hath
truly
sent
him
28
10
then
hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
yoke
from
off
the
prophet
jeremiah’s
neck
and
brake
it
28
11
and
hananiah
spake
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
even
so
will
i
break
the
yoke
of
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
from
the
neck
of
all
nations
within
the
space
of
two
full
years
and
the
prophet
jeremiah
went
his
way
28
12
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
after
that
hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
yoke
from
off
the
neck
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
28
13
go
and
tell
hananiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
hast
broken
the
yokes
of
wood
but
thou
shalt
make
for
them
yokes
of
iron
28
14
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
i
have
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
the
neck
of
all
these
nations
that
they
may
serve
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
they
shall
serve
him
and
i
have
given
him
the
beasts
of
the
field
also
28
15
then
said
the
prophet
jeremiah
unto
hananiah
the
prophet
hear
now
hananiah
the
lord
hath
not
sent
thee
but
thou
makest
this
people
to
trust
in
a
lie
28
16
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
cast
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
this
year
thou
shalt
die
because
thou
hast
taught
rebellion
against
the
lord
28
17
so
hananiah
the
prophet
died
the
same
year
in
the
seventh
month
29
1
now
these
are
the
words
of
the
letter
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
jerusalem
unto
the
residue
of
the
elders
which
were
carried
away
captives
and
to
the
priests
and
to
the
prophets
and
to
all
the
people
whom
nebuchadnezzar
had
carried
away
captive
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
29
2
(after
that
jeconiah
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
eunuchs
the
princes
of
judah
and
jerusalem
and
the
carpenters
and
the
smiths
were
departed
from
jerusalem
)
29
3
by
the
hand
of
elasah
the
son
of
shaphan
and
gemariah
the
son
of
hilkiah
(whom
zedekiah
king
of
judah
sent
unto
babylon
to
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon)
saying
29
4
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
unto
all
that
are
carried
away
captives
whom
i
have
caused
to
be
carried
away
from
jerusalem
unto
babylon
29
5
build
ye
houses
and
dwell
in
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
29
6
take
ye
wives
and
beget
sons
and
daughters
and
take
wives
for
your
sons
and
give
your
daughters
to
husbands
that
they
may
bear
sons
and
daughters
that
ye
may
be
increased
there
and
not
diminished
29
7
and
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
whither
i
have
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captives
and
pray
unto
the
lord
for
it
for
in
the
peace
thereof
shall
ye
have
peace
29
8
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
let
not
your
prophets
and
your
diviners
that
be
in
the
midst
of
you
deceive
you
neither
hearken
to
your
dreams
which
ye
cause
to
be
dreamed
29
9
for
they
prophesy
falsely
unto
you
in
my
name
i
have
not
sent
them
saith
the
lord
29
10
for
thus
saith
the
lord
that
after
seventy
years
be
accomplished
at
babylon
i
will
visit
you
and
perform
my
good
word
toward
you
in
causing
you
to
return
to
this
place
29
11
for
i
know
the
thoughts
that
i
think
toward
you
saith
the
lord
thoughts
of
peace
and
not
of
evil
to
give
you
an
expected
end
29
12
then
shall
ye
call
upon
me
and
ye
shall
go
and
pray
unto
me
and
i
will
hearken
unto
you
29
13
and
ye
shall
seek
me
and
find
me
when
ye
shall
search
for
me
with
all
your
heart
29
14
and
i
will
be
found
of
you
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
turn
away
your
captivity
and
i
will
gather
you
from
all
the
nations
and
from
all
the
places
whither
i
have
driven
you
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
bring
you
again
into
the
place
whence
i
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captive
29
15
because
ye
have
said
the
lord
hath
raised
us
up
prophets
in
babylon
29
16
know
that
thus
saith
the
lord
of
the
king
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
of
all
the
people
that
dwelleth
in
this
city
and
of
your
brethren
that
are
not
gone
forth
with
you
into
captivity
29
17
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
send
upon
them
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
will
make
them
like
vile
figs
that
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
29
18
and
i
will
persecute
them
with
the
sword
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
and
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
to
be
a
curse
and
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
whither
i
have
driven
them
29
19
because
they
have
not
hearkened
to
my
words
saith
the
lord
which
i
sent
unto
them
by
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
would
not
hear
saith
the
lord
29
20
hear
ye
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
all
ye
of
the
captivity
whom
i
have
sent
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
29
21
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
of
ahab
the
son
of
kolaiah
and
of
zedekiah
the
son
of
maaseiah
which
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
in
my
name
behold
i
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
slay
them
before
your
eyes
29
22
and
of
them
shall
be
taken
up
a
curse
by
all
the
captivity
of
judah
which
are
in
babylon
saying
the
lord
make
thee
like
zedekiah
and
like
ahab
whom
the
king
of
babylon
roasted
in
the
fire
29
23
because
they
have
committed
villany
in
israel
and
have
committed
adultery
with
their
neighbours’
wives
and
have
spoken
lying
words
in
my
name
which
i
have
not
commanded
them
even
i
know
and
am
a
witness
saith
the
lord
29
24
thus
shalt
thou
also
speak
to
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
saying
29
25
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
because
thou
hast
sent
letters
in
thy
name
unto
all
the
people
that
are
at
jerusalem
and
to
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
and
to
all
the
priests
saying
29
26
the
lord
hath
made
thee
priest
in
the
stead
of
jehoiada
the
priest
that
ye
should
be
officers
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
every
man
that
is
mad
and
maketh
himself
a
prophet
that
thou
shouldest
put
him
in
prison
and
in
the
stocks
29
27
now
therefore
why
hast
thou
not
reproved
jeremiah
of
anathoth
which
maketh
himself
a
prophet
to
you
29
28
for
therefore
he
sent
unto
us
in
babylon
saying
this
captivity
is
long
build
ye
houses
and
dwell
in
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
29
29
and
zephaniah
the
priest
read
this
letter
in
the
ears
of
jeremiah
the
prophet
29
30
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
29
31
send
to
all
them
of
the
captivity
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
because
that
shemaiah
hath
prophesied
unto
you
and
i
sent
him
not
and
he
caused
you
to
trust
in
a
lie
29
32
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
punish
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
and
his
seed
he
shall
not
have
a
man
to
dwell
among
this
people
neither
shall
he
behold
the
good
that
i
will
do
for
my
people
saith
the
lord
because
he
hath
taught
rebellion
against
the
lord
30
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
30
2
thus
speaketh
the
lord
god
of
israel
saying
write
thee
all
the
words
that
i
have
spoken
unto
thee
in
a
book
30
3
for
lo
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
my
people
israel
and
judah
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
them
to
return
to
the
land
that
i
gave
to
their
fathers
and
they
shall
possess
it
30
4
and
these
are
the
words
that
the
lord
spake
concerning
israel
and
concerning
judah
30
5
for
thus
saith
the
lord
we
have
heard
a
voice
of
trembling
of
fear
and
not
of
peace
30
6
ask
ye
now
and
see
whether
a
man
doth
travail
with
child
wherefore
do
i
see
every
man
with
his
hands
on
his
loins
as
a
woman
in
travail
and
all
faces
are
turned
into
paleness
30
7
alas
for
that
day
is
great
so
that
none
is
like
it
it
is
even
the
time
of
jacob’s
trouble
but
he
shall
be
saved
out
of
it
30
8
for
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
i
will
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
and
will
burst
thy
bonds
and
strangers
shall
no
more
serve
themselves
of
him
30
9
but
they
shall
serve
the
lord
their
god
and
david
their
king
whom
i
will
raise
up
unto
them
30
10
therefore
fear
thou
not
o
my
servant
jacob
saith
the
lord
neither
be
dismayed
o
israel
for
lo
i
will
save
thee
from
afar
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
and
jacob
shall
return
and
shall
be
in
rest
and
be
quiet
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid
30
11
for
i
am
with
thee
saith
the
lord
to
save
thee
though
i
make
a
full
end
of
all
nations
whither
i
have
scattered
thee
yet
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee
but
i
will
correct
thee
in
measure
and
will
not
leave
thee
altogether
unpunished
30
12
for
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
bruise
is
incurable
and
thy
wound
is
grievous
30
13
there
is
none
to
plead
thy
cause
that
thou
mayest
be
bound
up
thou
hast
no
healing
medicines
30
14
all
thy
lovers
have
forgotten
thee
they
seek
thee
not
for
i
have
wounded
thee
with
the
wound
of
an
enemy
with
the
chastisement
of
a
cruel
one
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
30
15
why
criest
thou
for
thine
affliction
thy
sorrow
is
incurable
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
i
have
done
these
things
unto
thee
30
16
therefore
all
they
that
devour
thee
shall
be
devoured
and
all
thine
adversaries
every
one
of
them
shall
go
into
captivity
and
they
that
spoil
thee
shall
be
a
spoil
and
all
that
prey
upon
thee
will
i
give
for
a
prey
30
17
for
i
will
restore
health
unto
thee
and
i
will
heal
thee
of
thy
wounds
saith
the
lord
because
they
called
thee
an
outcast
saying
this
is
zion
whom
no
man
seeketh
after
30
18
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
jacob’s
tents
and
have
mercy
on
his
dwellingplaces
and
the
city
shall
be
builded
upon
her
own
heap
and
the
palace
shall
remain
after
the
manner
thereof
30
19
and
out
of
them
shall
proceed
thanksgiving
and
the
voice
of
them
that
make
merry
and
i
will
multiply
them
and
they
shall
not
be
few
i
will
also
glorify
them
and
they
shall
not
be
small
30
20
their
children
also
shall
be
as
aforetime
and
their
congregation
shall
be
established
before
me
and
i
will
punish
all
that
oppress
them
30
21
and
their
nobles
shall
be
of
themselves
and
their
governor
shall
proceed
from
the
midst
of
them
and
i
will
cause
him
to
draw
near
and
he
shall
approach
unto
me
for
who
is
this
that
engaged
his
heart
to
approach
unto
me
saith
the
lord
30
22
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
30
23
behold
the
whirlwind
of
the
lord
goeth
forth
with
fury
a
continuing
whirlwind
it
shall
fall
with
pain
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked
30
24
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
shall
not
return
until
he
hath
done
it
and
until
he
have
performed
the
intents
of
his
heart
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it
31
1
at
the
same
time
saith
the
lord
will
i
be
the
god
of
all
the
families
of
israel
and
they
shall
be
my
people
31
2
thus
saith
the
lord
the
people
which
were
left
of
the
sword
found
grace
in
the
wilderness
even
israel
when
i
went
to
cause
him
to
rest
31
3
the
lord
hath
appeared
of
old
unto
me
saying
yea
i
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love
therefore
with
lovingkindness
have
i
drawn
thee
31
4
again
i
will
build
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
built
o
virgin
of
israel
thou
shalt
again
be
adorned
with
thy
tabrets
and
shalt
go
forth
in
the
dances
of
them
that
make
merry
31
5
thou
shalt
yet
plant
vines
upon
the
mountains
of
samaria
the
planters
shall
plant
and
shall
eat
them
as
common
things
31
6
for
there
shall
be
a
day
that
the
watchmen
upon
the
mount
ephraim
shall
cry
arise
ye
and
let
us
go
up
to
zion
unto
the
lord
our
god
31
7
for
thus
saith
the
lord
sing
with
gladness
for
jacob
and
shout
among
the
chief
of
the
nations
publish
ye
praise
ye
and
say
o
lord
save
thy
people
the
remnant
of
israel
31
8
behold
i
will
bring
them
from
the
north
country
and
gather
them
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
and
with
them
the
blind
and
the
lame
the
woman
with
child
and
her
that
travaileth
with
child
together
a
great
company
shall
return
thither
31
9
they
shall
come
with
weeping
and
with
supplications
will
i
lead
them
i
will
cause
them
to
walk
by
the
rivers
of
waters
in
a
straight
way
wherein
they
shall
not
stumble
for
i
am
a
father
to
israel
and
ephraim
is
my
firstborn
31
10
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
ye
nations
and
declare
it
in
the
isles
afar
off
and
say
he
that
scattered
israel
will
gather
him
and
keep
him
as
a
shepherd
doth
his
flock
31
11
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
ransomed
him
from
the
hand
of
him
that
was
stronger
than
he
31
12
therefore
they
shall
come
and
sing
in
the
height
of
zion
and
shall
flow
together
to
the
goodness
of
the
lord
for
wheat
and
for
wine
and
for
oil
and
for
the
young
of
the
flock
and
of
the
herd
and
their
soul
shall
be
as
a
watered
garden
and
they
shall
not
sorrow
any
more
at
all
31
13
then
shall
the
virgin
rejoice
in
the
dance
both
young
men
and
old
together
for
i
will
turn
their
mourning
into
joy
and
will
comfort
them
and
make
them
rejoice
from
their
sorrow
31
14
and
i
will
satiate
the
soul
of
the
priests
with
fatness
and
my
people
shall
be
satisfied
with
my
goodness
saith
the
lord
31
15
thus
saith
the
lord
a
voice
was
heard
in
ramah
lamentation
and
bitter
weeping
rahel
weeping
for
her
children
refused
to
be
comforted
for
her
children
because
they
were
not
31
16
thus
saith
the
lord
refrain
thy
voice
from
weeping
and
thine
eyes
from
tears
for
thy
work
shall
be
rewarded
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
come
again
from
the
land
of
the
enemy
31
17
and
there
is
hope
in
thine
end
saith
the
lord
that
thy
children
shall
come
again
to
their
own
border
31
18
i
have
surely
heard
ephraim
bemoaning
himself
thus
thou
hast
chastised
me
and
i
was
chastised
as
a
bullock
unaccustomed
to
the
yoke
turn
thou
me
and
i
shall
be
turned
for
thou
art
the
lord
my
god
31
19
surely
after
that
i
was
turned
i
repented
and
after
that
i
was
instructed
i
smote
upon
my
thigh
i
was
ashamed
yea
even
confounded
because
i
did
bear
the
reproach
of
my
youth
31
20
is
ephraim
my
dear
son
is
he
a
pleasant
child
for
since
i
spake
against
him
i
do
earnestly
remember
him
still
therefore
my
bowels
are
troubled
for
him
i
will
surely
have
mercy
upon
him
saith
the
lord
31
21
set
thee
up
waymarks
make
thee
high
heaps
set
thine
heart
toward
the
highway
even
the
way
which
thou
wentest
turn
again
o
virgin
of
israel
turn
again
to
these
thy
cities
31
22
how
long
wilt
thou
go
about
o
thou
backsliding
daughter
for
the
lord
hath
created
a
new
thing
in
the
earth
a
woman
shall
compass
a
man
31
23
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
as
yet
they
shall
use
this
speech
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
thereof
when
i
shall
bring
again
their
captivity
the
lord
bless
thee
o
habitation
of
justice
and
mountain
of
holiness
31
24
and
there
shall
dwell
in
judah
itself
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof
together
husbandmen
and
they
that
go
forth
with
flocks
31
25
for
i
have
satiated
the
weary
soul
and
i
have
replenished
every
sorrowful
soul
31
26
upon
this
i
awaked
and
beheld
and
my
sleep
was
sweet
unto
me
31
27
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
sow
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
with
the
seed
of
man
and
with
the
seed
of
beast
31
28
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
like
as
i
have
watched
over
them
to
pluck
up
and
to
break
down
and
to
throw
down
and
to
destroy
and
to
afflict
so
will
i
watch
over
them
to
build
and
to
plant
saith
the
lord
31
29
in
those
days
they
shall
say
no
more
the
fathers
have
eaten
a
sour
grape
and
the
children’s
teeth
are
set
on
edge
31
30
but
every
one
shall
die
for
his
own
iniquity
every
man
that
eateth
the
sour
grape
his
teeth
shall
be
set
on
edge
31
31
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
31
32
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
which
my
covenant
they
brake
although
i
was
an
husband
unto
them
saith
the
lord
31
33
but
this
shall
be
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
law
in
their
inward
parts
and
write
it
in
their
hearts
and
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
31
34
and
they
shall
teach
no
more
every
man
his
neighbour
and
every
man
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
for
they
shall
all
know
me
from
the
least
of
them
unto
the
greatest
of
them
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
forgive
their
iniquity
and
i
will
remember
their
sin
no
more
31
35
thus
saith
the
lord
which
giveth
the
sun
for
a
light
by
day
and
the
ordinances
of
the
moon
and
of
the
stars
for
a
light
by
night
which
divideth
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
roar
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
31
36
if
those
ordinances
depart
from
before
me
saith
the
lord
then
the
seed
of
israel
also
shall
cease
from
being
a
nation
before
me
for
ever
31
37
thus
saith
the
lord
if
heaven
above
can
be
measured
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
searched
out
beneath
i
will
also
cast
off
all
the
seed
of
israel
for
all
that
they
have
done
saith
the
lord
31
38
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
the
city
shall
be
built
to
the
lord
from
the
tower
of
hananeel
unto
the
gate
of
the
corner
31
39
and
the
measuring
line
shall
yet
go
forth
over
against
it
upon
the
hill
gareb
and
shall
compass
about
to
goath
31
40
and
the
whole
valley
of
the
dead
bodies
and
of
the
ashes
and
all
the
fields
unto
the
brook
of
kidron
unto
the
corner
of
the
horse
gate
toward
the
east
shall
be
holy
unto
the
lord
it
shall
not
be
plucked
up
nor
thrown
down
any
more
for
ever
32
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
in
the
tenth
year
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
which
was
the
eighteenth
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
32
2
for
then
the
king
of
babylon’s
army
besieged
jerusalem
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
was
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
which
was
in
the
king
of
judah’s
house
32
3
for
zedekiah
king
of
judah
had
shut
him
up
saying
wherefore
dost
thou
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take
it
32
4
and
zedekiah
king
of
judah
shall
not
escape
out
of
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
but
shall
surely
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
shall
speak
with
him
mouth
to
mouth
and
his
eyes
shall
behold
his
eyes
32
5
and
he
shall
lead
zedekiah
to
babylon
and
there
shall
he
be
until
i
visit
him
saith
the
lord
though
ye
fight
with
the
chaldeans
ye
shall
not
prosper
32
6
and
jeremiah
said
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
32
7
behold
hanameel
the
son
of
shallum
thine
uncle
shall
come
unto
thee
saying
buy
thee
my
field
that
is
in
anathoth
for
the
right
of
redemption
is
thine
to
buy
it
32
8
so
hanameel
mine
uncle’s
son
came
to
me
in
the
court
of
the
prison
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
said
unto
me
buy
my
field
i
pray
thee
that
is
in
anathoth
which
is
in
the
country
of
benjamin
for
the
right
of
inheritance
is
thine
and
the
redemption
is
thine
buy
it
for
thyself
then
i
knew
that
this
was
the
word
of
the
lord
32
9
and
i
bought
the
field
of
hanameel
my
uncle’s
son
that
was
in
anathoth
and
weighed
him
the
money
even
seventeen
shekels
of
silver
32
10
and
i
subscribed
the
evidence
and
sealed
it
and
took
witnesses
and
weighed
him
the
money
in
the
balances
32
11
so
i
took
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
both
that
which
was
sealed
according
to
the
law
and
custom
and
that
which
was
open
32
12
and
i
gave
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
the
son
of
maaseiah
in
the
sight
of
hanameel
mine
uncle’s
son
and
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
that
subscribed
the
book
of
the
purchase
before
all
the
jews
that
sat
in
the
court
of
the
prison
32
13
and
i
charged
baruch
before
them
saying
32
14
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
take
these
evidences
this
evidence
of
the
purchase
both
which
is
sealed
and
this
evidence
which
is
open
and
put
them
in
an
earthen
vessel
that
they
may
continue
many
days
32
15
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
shall
be
possessed
again
in
this
land
32
16
now
when
i
had
delivered
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
32
17
ah
lord
god
behold
thou
hast
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
by
thy
great
power
and
stretched
out
arm
and
there
is
nothing
too
hard
for
thee
32
18
thou
shewest
lovingkindness
unto
thousands
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
of
their
children
after
them
the
great
the
mighty
god
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
32
19
great
in
counsel
and
mighty
in
work
for
thine
eyes
are
open
upon
all
the
ways
of
the
sons
of
men
to
give
every
one
according
to
his
ways
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings
32
20
which
hast
set
signs
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
and
in
israel
and
among
other
men
and
hast
made
thee
a
name
as
at
this
day
32
21
and
hast
brought
forth
thy
people
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
signs
and
with
wonders
and
with
a
strong
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
great
terror
32
22
and
hast
given
them
this
land
which
thou
didst
swear
to
their
fathers
to
give
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
32
23
and
they
came
in
and
possessed
it
but
they
obeyed
not
thy
voice
neither
walked
in
thy
law
they
have
done
nothing
of
all
that
thou
commandedst
them
to
do
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
to
come
upon
them
32
24
behold
the
mounts
they
are
come
unto
the
city
to
take
it
and
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
it
because
of
the
sword
and
of
the
famine
and
of
the
pestilence
and
what
thou
hast
spoken
is
come
to
pass
and
behold
thou
seest
it
32
25
and
thou
hast
said
unto
me
o
lord
god
buy
thee
the
field
for
money
and
take
witnesses
for
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
32
26
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
32
27
behold
i
am
the
lord
the
god
of
all
flesh
is
there
any
thing
too
hard
for
me
32
28
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
and
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take
it
32
29
and
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
this
city
shall
come
and
set
fire
on
this
city
and
burn
it
with
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
offered
incense
unto
baal
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
to
provoke
me
to
anger
32
30
for
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
judah
have
only
done
evil
before
me
from
their
youth
for
the
children
of
israel
have
only
provoked
me
to
anger
with
the
work
of
their
hands
saith
the
lord
32
31
for
this
city
hath
been
to
me
as
a
provocation
of
mine
anger
and
of
my
fury
from
the
day
that
they
built
it
even
unto
this
day
that
i
should
remove
it
from
before
my
face
32
32
because
of
all
the
evil
of
the
children
of
israel
and
of
the
children
of
judah
which
they
have
done
to
provoke
me
to
anger
they
their
kings
their
princes
their
priests
and
their
prophets
and
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
32
33
and
they
have
turned
unto
me
the
back
and
not
the
face
though
i
taught
them
rising
up
early
and
teaching
them
yet
they
have
not
hearkened
to
receive
instruction
32
34
but
they
set
their
abominations
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
to
defile
it
32
35
and
they
built
the
high
places
of
baal
which
are
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
to
cause
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
unto
molech
which
i
commanded
them
not
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
that
they
should
do
this
abomination
to
cause
judah
to
sin
32
36
and
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
concerning
this
city
whereof
ye
say
it
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
32
37
behold
i
will
gather
them
out
of
all
countries
whither
i
have
driven
them
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
in
great
wrath
and
i
will
bring
them
again
unto
this
place
and
i
will
cause
them
to
dwell
safely
32
38
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
32
39
and
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
one
way
that
they
may
fear
me
for
ever
for
the
good
of
them
and
of
their
children
after
them
32
40
and
i
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them
that
i
will
not
turn
away
from
them
to
do
them
good
but
i
will
put
my
fear
in
their
hearts
that
they
shall
not
depart
from
me
32
41
yea
i
will
rejoice
over
them
to
do
them
good
and
i
will
plant
them
in
this
land
assuredly
with
my
whole
heart
and
with
my
whole
soul
32
42
for
thus
saith
the
lord
like
as
i
have
brought
all
this
great
evil
upon
this
people
so
will
i
bring
upon
them
all
the
good
that
i
have
promised
them
32
43
and
fields
shall
be
bought
in
this
land
whereof
ye
say
it
is
desolate
without
man
or
beast
it
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
32
44
men
shall
buy
fields
for
money
and
subscribe
evidences
and
seal
them
and
take
witnesses
in
the
land
of
benjamin
and
in
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
of
the
mountains
and
in
the
cities
of
the
valley
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south
for
i
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return
saith
the
lord
33
1
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
the
second
time
while
he
was
yet
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
saying
33
2
thus
saith
the
lord
the
maker
thereof
the
lord
that
formed
it
to
establish
it
the
lord
is
his
name
33
3
call
unto
me
and
i
will
answer
thee
and
shew
thee
great
and
mighty
things
which
thou
knowest
not
33
4
for
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
concerning
the
houses
of
this
city
and
concerning
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
judah
which
are
thrown
down
by
the
mounts
and
by
the
sword
33
5
they
come
to
fight
with
the
chaldeans
but
it
is
to
fill
them
with
the
dead
bodies
of
men
whom
i
have
slain
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
for
all
whose
wickedness
i
have
hid
my
face
from
this
city
33
6
behold
i
will
bring
it
health
and
cure
and
i
will
cure
them
and
will
reveal
unto
them
the
abundance
of
peace
and
truth
33
7
and
i
will
cause
the
captivity
of
judah
and
the
captivity
of
israel
to
return
and
will
build
them
as
at
the
first
33
8
and
i
will
cleanse
them
from
all
their
iniquity
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
me
and
i
will
pardon
all
their
iniquities
whereby
they
have
sinned
and
whereby
they
have
transgressed
against
me
33
9
and
it
shall
be
to
me
a
name
of
joy
a
praise
and
an
honour
before
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
which
shall
hear
all
the
good
that
i
do
unto
them
and
they
shall
fear
and
tremble
for
all
the
goodness
and
for
all
the
prosperity
that
i
procure
unto
it
33
10
thus
saith
the
lord
again
there
shall
be
heard
in
this
place
which
ye
say
shall
be
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast
even
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
that
are
desolate
without
man
and
without
inhabitant
and
without
beast
33
11
the
voice
of
joy
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
voice
of
them
that
shall
say
praise
the
lord
of
hosts
for
the
lord
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
and
of
them
that
shall
bring
the
sacrifice
of
praise
into
the
house
of
the
lord
for
i
will
cause
to
return
the
captivity
of
the
land
as
at
the
first
saith
the
lord
33
12
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
again
in
this
place
which
is
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
an
habitation
of
shepherds
causing
their
flocks
to
lie
down
33
13
in
the
cities
of
the
mountains
in
the
cities
of
the
vale
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south
and
in
the
land
of
benjamin
and
in
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
in
the
cities
of
judah
shall
the
flocks
pass
again
under
the
hands
of
him
that
telleth
them
saith
the
lord
33
14
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
perform
that
good
thing
which
i
have
promised
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
to
the
house
of
judah
33
15
in
those
days
and
at
that
time
will
i
cause
the
branch
of
righteousness
to
grow
up
unto
david
and
he
shall
execute
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
land
33
16
in
those
days
shall
judah
be
saved
and
jerusalem
shall
dwell
safely
and
this
is
the
name
wherewith
she
shall
be
called
the
lord
our
righteousness
33
17
for
thus
saith
the
lord
david
shall
never
want
a
man
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
house
of
israel
33
18
neither
shall
the
priests
the
levites
want
a
man
before
me
to
offer
burnt
offerings
and
to
kindle
meat
offerings
and
to
do
sacrifice
continually
33
19
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
saying
33
20
thus
saith
the
lord
if
ye
can
break
my
covenant
of
the
day
and
my
covenant
of
the
night
and
that
there
should
not
be
day
and
night
in
their
season
33
21
then
may
also
my
covenant
be
broken
with
david
my
servant
that
he
should
not
have
a
son
to
reign
upon
his
throne
and
with
the
levites
the
priests
my
ministers
33
22
as
the
host
of
heaven
cannot
be
numbered
neither
the
sand
of
the
sea
measured
so
will
i
multiply
the
seed
of
david
my
servant
and
the
levites
that
minister
unto
me
33
23
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
saying
33
24
considerest
thou
not
what
this
people
have
spoken
saying
the
two
families
which
the
lord
hath
chosen
he
hath
even
cast
them
off
thus
they
have
despised
my
people
that
they
should
be
no
more
a
nation
before
them
33
25
thus
saith
the
lord
if
my
covenant
be
not
with
day
and
night
and
if
i
have
not
appointed
the
ordinances
of
heaven
and
earth
33
26
then
will
i
cast
away
the
seed
of
jacob
and
david
my
servant
so
that
i
will
not
take
any
of
his
seed
to
be
rulers
over
the
seed
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
for
i
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return
and
have
mercy
on
them
34
1
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
when
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
all
his
army
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
of
his
dominion
and
all
the
people
fought
against
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
thereof
saying
34
2
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
go
and
speak
to
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
tell
him
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire
34
3
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
his
hand
but
shalt
surely
be
taken
and
delivered
into
his
hand
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
to
mouth
and
thou
shalt
go
to
babylon
34
4
yet
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
zedekiah
king
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
of
thee
thou
shalt
not
die
by
the
sword
34
5
but
thou
shalt
die
in
peace
and
with
the
burnings
of
thy
fathers
the
former
kings
which
were
before
thee
so
shall
they
burn
odours
for
thee
and
they
will
lament
thee
saying
ah
lord
for
i
have
pronounced
the
word
saith
the
lord
34
6
then
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
jerusalem
34
7
when
the
king
of
babylon’s
army
fought
against
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
of
judah
that
were
left
against
lachish
and
against
azekah
for
these
defenced
cities
remained
of
the
cities
of
judah
34
8
this
is
the
word
that
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
after
that
the
king
zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
which
were
at
jerusalem
to
proclaim
liberty
unto
them
34
9
that
every
man
should
let
his
manservant
and
every
man
his
maidservant
being
an
hebrew
or
an
hebrewess
go
free
that
none
should
serve
himself
of
them
to
wit
of
a
jew
his
brother
34
10
now
when
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
which
had
entered
into
the
covenant
heard
that
every
one
should
let
his
manservant
and
every
one
his
maidservant
go
free
that
none
should
serve
themselves
of
them
any
more
then
they
obeyed
and
let
them
go
34
11
but
afterward
they
turned
and
caused
the
servants
and
the
handmaids
whom
they
had
let
go
free
to
return
and
brought
them
into
subjection
for
servants
and
for
handmaids
34
12
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
34
13
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
i
made
a
covenant
with
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen
saying
34
14
at
the
end
of
seven
years
let
ye
go
every
man
his
brother
an
hebrew
which
hath
been
sold
unto
thee
and
when
he
hath
served
thee
six
years
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee
but
your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
me
neither
inclined
their
ear
34
15
and
ye
were
now
turned
and
had
done
right
in
my
sight
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
man
to
his
neighbour
and
ye
had
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
34
16
but
ye
turned
and
polluted
my
name
and
caused
every
man
his
servant
and
every
man
his
handmaid
whom
ye
had
set
at
liberty
at
their
pleasure
to
return
and
brought
them
into
subjection
to
be
unto
you
for
servants
and
for
handmaids
34
17
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
one
to
his
brother
and
every
man
to
his
neighbour
behold
i
proclaim
a
liberty
for
you
saith
the
lord
to
the
sword
to
the
pestilence
and
to
the
famine
and
i
will
make
you
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
34
18
and
i
will
give
the
men
that
have
transgressed
my
covenant
which
have
not
performed
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
before
me
when
they
cut
the
calf
in
twain
and
passed
between
the
parts
thereof
34
19
the
princes
of
judah
and
the
princes
of
jerusalem
the
eunuchs
and
the
priests
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
which
passed
between
the
parts
of
the
calf
34
20
i
will
even
give
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
be
for
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth
34
21
and
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
his
princes
will
i
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon’s
army
which
are
gone
up
from
you
34
22
behold
i
will
command
saith
the
lord
and
cause
them
to
return
to
this
city
and
they
shall
fight
against
it
and
take
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
and
i
will
make
the
cities
of
judah
a
desolation
without
an
inhabitant
35
1
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
in
the
days
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
saying
35
2
go
unto
the
house
of
the
rechabites
and
speak
unto
them
and
bring
them
into
the
house
of
the
lord
into
one
of
the
chambers
and
give
them
wine
to
drink
35
3
then
i
took
jaazaniah
the
son
of
jeremiah
the
son
of
habaziniah
and
his
brethren
and
all
his
sons
and
the
whole
house
of
the
rechabites
35
4
and
i
brought
them
into
the
house
of
the
lord
into
the
chamber
of
the
sons
of
hanan
the
son
of
igdaliah
a
man
of
god
which
was
by
the
chamber
of
the
princes
which
was
above
the
chamber
of
maaseiah
the
son
of
shallum
the
keeper
of
the
door
35
5
and
i
set
before
the
sons
of
the
house
of
the
rechabites
pots
full
of
wine
and
cups
and
i
said
unto
them
drink
ye
wine
35
6
but
they
said
we
will
drink
no
wine
for
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
our
father
commanded
us
saying
ye
shall
drink
no
wine
neither
ye
nor
your
sons
for
ever
35
7
neither
shall
ye
build
house
nor
sow
seed
nor
plant
vineyard
nor
have
any
but
all
your
days
ye
shall
dwell
in
tents
that
ye
may
live
many
days
in
the
land
where
ye
be
strangers
35
8
thus
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
our
father
in
all
that
he
hath
charged
us
to
drink
no
wine
all
our
days
we
our
wives
our
sons
nor
our
daughters
35
9
nor
to
build
houses
for
us
to
dwell
in
neither
have
we
vineyard
nor
field
nor
seed
35
10
but
we
have
dwelt
in
tents
and
have
obeyed
and
done
according
to
all
that
jonadab
our
father
commanded
us
35
11
but
it
came
to
pass
when
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
came
up
into
the
land
that
we
said
come
and
let
us
go
to
jerusalem
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
and
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
syrians
so
we
dwell
at
jerusalem
35
12
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
35
13
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
go
and
tell
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
will
ye
not
receive
instruction
to
hearken
to
my
words
saith
the
lord
35
14
the
words
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
that
he
commanded
his
sons
not
to
drink
wine
are
performed
for
unto
this
day
they
drink
none
but
obey
their
father’s
commandment
notwithstanding
i
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
ye
hearkened
not
unto
me
35
15
i
have
sent
also
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
saying
return
ye
now
every
man
from
his
evil
way
and
amend
your
doings
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
which
i
have
given
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
but
ye
have
not
inclined
your
ear
nor
hearkened
unto
me
35
16
because
the
sons
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
have
performed
the
commandment
of
their
father
which
he
commanded
them
but
this
people
hath
not
hearkened
unto
me
35
17
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
upon
judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
them
because
i
have
spoken
unto
them
but
they
have
not
heard
and
i
have
called
unto
them
but
they
have
not
answered
35
18
and
jeremiah
said
unto
the
house
of
the
rechabites
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
because
ye
have
obeyed
the
commandment
of
jonadab
your
father
and
kept
all
his
precepts
and
done
according
unto
all
that
he
hath
commanded
you
35
19
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
shall
not
want
a
man
to
stand
before
me
for
ever
36
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
that
this
word
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
36
2
take
thee
a
roll
of
a
book
and
write
therein
all
the
words
that
i
have
spoken
unto
thee
against
israel
and
against
judah
and
against
all
the
nations
from
the
day
i
spake
unto
thee
from
the
days
of
josiah
even
unto
this
day
36
3
it
may
be
that
the
house
of
judah
will
hear
all
the
evil
which
i
purpose
to
do
unto
them
that
they
may
return
every
man
from
his
evil
way
that
i
may
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
36
4
then
jeremiah
called
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
and
baruch
wrote
from
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
had
spoken
unto
him
upon
a
roll
of
a
book
36
5
and
jeremiah
commanded
baruch
saying
i
am
shut
up
i
cannot
go
into
the
house
of
the
lord
36
6
therefore
go
thou
and
read
in
the
roll
which
thou
hast
written
from
my
mouth
the
words
of
the
lord
in
the
ears
of
the
people
in
the
lord’s
house
upon
the
fasting
day
and
also
thou
shalt
read
them
in
the
ears
of
all
judah
that
come
out
of
their
cities
36
7
it
may
be
they
will
present
their
supplication
before
the
lord
and
will
return
every
one
from
his
evil
way
for
great
is
the
anger
and
the
fury
that
the
lord
hath
pronounced
against
this
people
36
8
and
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
did
according
to
all
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
him
reading
in
the
book
the
words
of
the
lord
in
the
lord’s
house
36
9
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
in
the
ninth
month
that
they
proclaimed
a
fast
before
the
lord
to
all
the
people
in
jerusalem
and
to
all
the
people
that
came
from
the
cities
of
judah
unto
jerusalem
36
10
then
read
baruch
in
the
book
the
words
of
jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
chamber
of
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
the
scribe
in
the
higher
court
at
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people
36
11
when
michaiah
the
son
of
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
had
heard
out
of
the
book
all
the
words
of
the
lord
36
12
then
he
went
down
into
the
king’s
house
into
the
scribe’s
chamber
and
lo
all
the
princes
sat
there
even
elishama
the
scribe
and
delaiah
the
son
of
shemaiah
and
elnathan
the
son
of
achbor
and
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
hananiah
and
all
the
princes
36
13
then
michaiah
declared
unto
them
all
the
words
that
he
had
heard
when
baruch
read
the
book
in
the
ears
of
the
people
36
14
therefore
all
the
princes
sent
jehudi
the
son
of
nethaniah
the
son
of
shelemiah
the
son
of
cushi
unto
baruch
saying
take
in
thine
hand
the
roll
wherein
thou
hast
read
in
the
ears
of
the
people
and
come
so
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
took
the
roll
in
his
hand
and
came
unto
them
36
15
and
they
said
unto
him
sit
down
now
and
read
it
in
our
ears
so
baruch
read
it
in
their
ears
36
16
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
heard
all
the
words
they
were
afraid
both
one
and
other
and
said
unto
baruch
we
will
surely
tell
the
king
of
all
these
words
36
17
and
they
asked
baruch
saying
tell
us
now
how
didst
thou
write
all
these
words
at
his
mouth
36
18
then
baruch
answered
them
he
pronounced
all
these
words
unto
me
with
his
mouth
and
i
wrote
them
with
ink
in
the
book
36
19
then
said
the
princes
unto
baruch
go
hide
thee
thou
and
jeremiah
and
let
no
man
know
where
ye
be
36
20
and
they
went
in
to
the
king
into
the
court
but
they
laid
up
the
roll
in
the
chamber
of
elishama
the
scribe
and
told
all
the
words
in
the
ears
of
the
king
36
21
so
the
king
sent
jehudi
to
fetch
the
roll
and
he
took
it
out
of
elishama
the
scribe’s
chamber
and
jehudi
read
it
in
the
ears
of
the
king
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
princes
which
stood
beside
the
king
36
22
now
the
king
sat
in
the
winterhouse
in
the
ninth
month
and
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
burning
before
him
36
23
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jehudi
had
read
three
or
four
leaves
he
cut
it
with
the
penknife
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth
until
all
the
roll
was
consumed
in
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth
36
24
yet
they
were
not
afraid
nor
rent
their
garments
neither
the
king
nor
any
of
his
servants
that
heard
all
these
words
36
25
nevertheless
elnathan
and
delaiah
and
gemariah
had
made
intercession
to
the
king
that
he
would
not
burn
the
roll
but
he
would
not
hear
them
36
26
but
the
king
commanded
jerahmeel
the
son
of
hammelech
and
seraiah
the
son
of
azriel
and
shelemiah
the
son
of
abdeel
to
take
baruch
the
scribe
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
but
the
lord
hid
them
36
27
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
after
that
the
king
had
burned
the
roll
and
the
words
which
baruch
wrote
at
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
saying
36
28
take
thee
again
another
roll
and
write
in
it
all
the
former
words
that
were
in
the
first
roll
which
jehoiakim
the
king
of
judah
hath
burned
36
29
and
thou
shalt
say
to
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
hast
burned
this
roll
saying
why
hast
thou
written
therein
saying
the
king
of
babylon
shall
certainly
come
and
destroy
this
land
and
shall
cause
to
cease
from
thence
man
and
beast
36
30
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
he
shall
have
none
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
his
dead
body
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
day
to
the
heat
and
in
the
night
to
the
frost
36
31
and
i
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
iniquity
and
i
will
bring
upon
them
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
upon
the
men
of
judah
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
them
but
they
hearkened
not
36
32
then
took
jeremiah
another
roll
and
gave
it
to
baruch
the
scribe
the
son
of
neriah
who
wrote
therein
from
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
had
burned
in
the
fire
and
there
were
added
besides
unto
them
many
like
words
37
1
and
king
zedekiah
the
son
of
josiah
reigned
instead
of
coniah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
whom
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
made
king
in
the
land
of
judah
37
2
but
neither
he
nor
his
servants
nor
the
people
of
the
land
did
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
the
prophet
jeremiah
37
3
and
zedekiah
the
king
sent
jehucal
the
son
of
shelemiah
and
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
to
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
pray
now
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
us
37
4
now
jeremiah
came
in
and
went
out
among
the
people
for
they
had
not
put
him
into
prison
37
5
then
pharaoh’s
army
was
come
forth
out
of
egypt
and
when
the
chaldeans
that
besieged
jerusalem
heard
tidings
of
them
they
departed
from
jerusalem
37
6
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
37
7
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
thus
shall
ye
say
to
the
king
of
judah
that
sent
you
unto
me
to
enquire
of
me
behold
pharaoh’s
army
which
is
come
forth
to
help
you
shall
return
to
egypt
into
their
own
land
37
8
and
the
chaldeans
shall
come
again
and
fight
against
this
city
and
take
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
37
9
thus
saith
the
lord
deceive
not
yourselves
saying
the
chaldeans
shall
surely
depart
from
us
for
they
shall
not
depart
37
10
for
though
ye
had
smitten
the
whole
army
of
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
you
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
them
yet
should
they
rise
up
every
man
in
his
tent
and
burn
this
city
with
fire
37
11
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
was
broken
up
from
jerusalem
for
fear
of
pharaoh’s
army
37
12
then
jeremiah
went
forth
out
of
jerusalem
to
go
into
the
land
of
benjamin
to
separate
himself
thence
in
the
midst
of
the
people
37
13
and
when
he
was
in
the
gate
of
benjamin
a
captain
of
the
ward
was
there
whose
name
was
irijah
the
son
of
shelemiah
the
son
of
hananiah
and
he
took
jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
thou
fallest
away
to
the
chaldeans
37
14
then
said
jeremiah
it
is
false
i
fall
not
away
to
the
chaldeans
but
he
hearkened
not
to
him
so
irijah
took
jeremiah
and
brought
him
to
the
princes
37
15
wherefore
the
princes
were
wroth
with
jeremiah
and
smote
him
and
put
him
in
prison
in
the
house
of
jonathan
the
scribe
for
they
had
made
that
the
prison
37
16
when
jeremiah
was
entered
into
the
dungeon
and
into
the
cabins
and
jeremiah
had
remained
there
many
days
37
17
then
zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
took
him
out
and
the
king
asked
him
secretly
in
his
house
and
said
is
there
any
word
from
the
lord
and
jeremiah
said
there
is
for
said
he
thou
shalt
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
37
18
moreover
jeremiah
said
unto
king
zedekiah
what
have
i
offended
against
thee
or
against
thy
servants
or
against
this
people
that
ye
have
put
me
in
prison
37
19
where
are
now
your
prophets
which
prophesied
unto
you
saying
the
king
of
babylon
shall
not
come
against
you
nor
against
this
land
37
20
therefore
hear
now
i
pray
thee
o
my
lord
the
king
let
my
supplication
i
pray
thee
be
accepted
before
thee
that
thou
cause
me
not
to
return
to
the
house
of
jonathan
the
scribe
lest
i
die
there
37
21
then
zedekiah
the
king
commanded
that
they
should
commit
jeremiah
into
the
court
of
the
prison
and
that
they
should
give
him
daily
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
the
bakers’
street
until
all
the
bread
in
the
city
were
spent
thus
jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison
38
1
then
shephatiah
the
son
of
mattan
and
gedaliah
the
son
of
pashur
and
jucal
the
son
of
shelemiah
and
pashur
the
son
of
malchiah
heard
the
words
that
jeremiah
had
spoken
unto
all
the
people
saying
38
2
thus
saith
the
lord
he
that
remaineth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
but
he
that
goeth
forth
to
the
chaldeans
shall
live
for
he
shall
have
his
life
for
a
prey
and
shall
live
38
3
thus
saith
the
lord
this
city
shall
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon’s
army
which
shall
take
it
38
4
therefore
the
princes
said
unto
the
king
we
beseech
thee
let
this
man
be
put
to
death
for
thus
he
weakeneth
the
hands
of
the
men
of
war
that
remain
in
this
city
and
the
hands
of
all
the
people
in
speaking
such
words
unto
them
for
this
man
seeketh
not
the
welfare
of
this
people
but
the
hurt
38
5
then
zedekiah
the
king
said
behold
he
is
in
your
hand
for
the
king
is
not
he
that
can
do
any
thing
against
you
38
6
then
took
they
jeremiah
and
cast
him
into
the
dungeon
of
malchiah
the
son
of
hammelech
that
was
in
the
court
of
the
prison
and
they
let
down
jeremiah
with
cords
and
in
the
dungeon
there
was
no
water
but
mire
so
jeremiah
sunk
in
the
mire
38
7
now
when
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
one
of
the
eunuchs
which
was
in
the
king’s
house
heard
that
they
had
put
jeremiah
in
the
dungeon
the
king
then
sitting
in
the
gate
of
benjamin
38
8
ebedmelech
went
forth
out
of
the
king’s
house
and
spake
to
the
king
saying
38
9
my
lord
the
king
these
men
have
done
evil
in
all
that
they
have
done
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
whom
they
have
cast
into
the
dungeon
and
he
is
like
to
die
for
hunger
in
the
place
where
he
is
for
there
is
no
more
bread
in
the
city
38
10
then
the
king
commanded
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
saying
take
from
hence
thirty
men
with
thee
and
take
up
jeremiah
the
prophet
out
of
the
dungeon
before
he
die
38
11
so
ebedmelech
took
the
men
with
him
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
king
under
the
treasury
and
took
thence
old
cast
clouts
and
old
rotten
rags
and
let
them
down
by
cords
into
the
dungeon
to
jeremiah
38
12
and
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
said
unto
jeremiah
put
now
these
old
cast
clouts
and
rotten
rags
under
thine
armholes
under
the
cords
and
jeremiah
did
so
38
13
so
they
drew
up
jeremiah
with
cords
and
took
him
up
out
of
the
dungeon
and
jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison
38
14
then
zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
took
jeremiah
the
prophet
unto
him
into
the
third
entry
that
is
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king
said
unto
jeremiah
i
will
ask
thee
a
thing
hide
nothing
from
me
38
15
then
jeremiah
said
unto
zedekiah
if
i
declare
it
unto
thee
wilt
thou
not
surely
put
me
to
death
and
if
i
give
thee
counsel
wilt
thou
not
hearken
unto
me
38
16
so
zedekiah
the
king
sware
secretly
unto
jeremiah
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
that
made
us
this
soul
i
will
not
put
thee
to
death
neither
will
i
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
these
men
that
seek
thy
life
38
17
then
said
jeremiah
unto
zedekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
if
thou
wilt
assuredly
go
forth
unto
the
king
of
babylon’s
princes
then
thy
soul
shall
live
and
this
city
shall
not
be
burned
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
live
and
thine
house
38
18
but
if
thou
wilt
not
go
forth
to
the
king
of
babylon’s
princes
then
shall
this
city
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
and
they
shall
burn
it
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
38
19
and
zedekiah
the
king
said
unto
jeremiah
i
am
afraid
of
the
jews
that
are
fallen
to
the
chaldeans
lest
they
deliver
me
into
their
hand
and
they
mock
me
38
20
but
jeremiah
said
they
shall
not
deliver
thee
obey
i
beseech
thee
the
voice
of
the
lord
which
i
speak
unto
thee
so
it
shall
be
well
unto
thee
and
thy
soul
shall
live
38
21
but
if
thou
refuse
to
go
forth
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
38
22
and
behold
all
the
women
that
are
left
in
the
king
of
judah’s
house
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
king
of
babylon’s
princes
and
those
women
shall
say
thy
friends
have
set
thee
on
and
have
prevailed
against
thee
thy
feet
are
sunk
in
the
mire
and
they
are
turned
away
back
38
23
so
they
shall
bring
out
all
thy
wives
and
thy
children
to
the
chaldeans
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
but
shalt
be
taken
by
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
thou
shalt
cause
this
city
to
be
burned
with
fire
38
24
then
said
zedekiah
unto
jeremiah
let
no
man
know
of
these
words
and
thou
shalt
not
die
38
25
but
if
the
princes
hear
that
i
have
talked
with
thee
and
they
come
unto
thee
and
say
unto
thee
declare
unto
us
now
what
thou
hast
said
unto
the
king
hide
it
not
from
us
and
we
will
not
put
thee
to
death
also
what
the
king
said
unto
thee
38
26
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
i
presented
my
supplication
before
the
king
that
he
would
not
cause
me
to
return
to
jonathan’s
house
to
die
there
38
27
then
came
all
the
princes
unto
jeremiah
and
asked
him
and
he
told
them
according
to
all
these
words
that
the
king
had
commanded
so
they
left
off
speaking
with
him
for
the
matter
was
not
perceived
38
28
so
jeremiah
abode
in
the
court
of
the
prison
until
the
day
that
jerusalem
was
taken
and
he
was
there
when
jerusalem
was
taken
39
1
in
the
ninth
year
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
the
tenth
month
came
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
all
his
army
against
jerusalem
and
they
besieged
it
39
2
and
in
the
eleventh
year
of
zedekiah
in
the
fourth
month
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
city
was
broken
up
39
3
and
all
the
princes
of
the
king
of
babylon
came
in
and
sat
in
the
middle
gate
even
nergalsharezer
samgarnebo
sarsechim
rabsaris
nergalsharezer
rabmag
with
all
the
residue
of
the
princes
of
the
king
of
babylon
39
4
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
saw
them
and
all
the
men
of
war
then
they
fled
and
went
forth
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
king’s
garden
by
the
gate
betwixt
the
two
walls
and
he
went
out
the
way
of
the
plain
39
5
but
the
chaldeans’
army
pursued
after
them
and
overtook
zedekiah
in
the
plains
of
jericho
and
when
they
had
taken
him
they
brought
him
up
to
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
to
riblah
in
the
land
of
hamath
where
he
gave
judgment
upon
him
39
6
then
the
king
of
babylon
slew
the
sons
of
zedekiah
in
riblah
before
his
eyes
also
the
king
of
babylon
slew
all
the
nobles
of
judah
39
7
moreover
he
put
out
zedekiah’s
eyes
and
bound
him
with
chains
to
carry
him
to
babylon
39
8
and
the
chaldeans
burned
the
king’s
house
and
the
houses
of
the
people
with
fire
and
brake
down
the
walls
of
jerusalem
39
9
then
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
the
remnant
of
the
people
that
remained
in
the
city
and
those
that
fell
away
that
fell
to
him
with
the
rest
of
the
people
that
remained
39
10
but
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
left
of
the
poor
of
the
people
which
had
nothing
in
the
land
of
judah
and
gave
them
vineyards
and
fields
at
the
same
time
39
11
now
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
gave
charge
concerning
jeremiah
to
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
saying
39
12
take
him
and
look
well
to
him
and
do
him
no
harm
but
do
unto
him
even
as
he
shall
say
unto
thee
39
13
so
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
sent
and
nebushasban
rabsaris
and
nergalsharezer
rabmag
and
all
the
king
of
babylon’s
princes
39
14
even
they
sent
and
took
jeremiah
out
of
the
court
of
the
prison
and
committed
him
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
that
he
should
carry
him
home
so
he
dwelt
among
the
people
39
15
now
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
while
he
was
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
saying
39
16
go
and
speak
to
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
my
words
upon
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
they
shall
be
accomplished
in
that
day
before
thee
39
17
but
i
will
deliver
thee
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
and
thou
shalt
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
men
of
whom
thou
art
afraid
39
18
for
i
will
surely
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
fall
by
the
sword
but
thy
life
shall
be
for
a
prey
unto
thee
because
thou
hast
put
thy
trust
in
me
saith
the
lord
40
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
after
that
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
let
him
go
from
ramah
when
he
had
taken
him
being
bound
in
chains
among
all
that
were
carried
away
captive
of
jerusalem
and
judah
which
were
carried
away
captive
unto
babylon
40
2
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
took
jeremiah
and
said
unto
him
the
lord
thy
god
hath
pronounced
this
evil
upon
this
place
40
3
now
the
lord
hath
brought
it
and
done
according
as
he
hath
said
because
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
have
not
obeyed
his
voice
therefore
this
thing
is
come
upon
you
40
4
and
now
behold
i
loose
thee
this
day
from
the
chains
which
were
upon
thine
hand
if
it
seem
good
unto
thee
to
come
with
me
into
babylon
come
and
i
will
look
well
unto
thee
but
if
it
seem
ill
unto
thee
to
come
with
me
into
babylon
forbear
behold
all
the
land
is
before
thee
whither
it
seemeth
good
and
convenient
for
thee
to
go
thither
go
40
5
now
while
he
was
not
yet
gone
back
he
said
go
back
also
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
whom
the
king
of
babylon
hath
made
governor
over
the
cities
of
judah
and
dwell
with
him
among
the
people
or
go
wheresoever
it
seemeth
convenient
unto
thee
to
go
so
the
captain
of
the
guard
gave
him
victuals
and
a
reward
and
let
him
go
40
6
then
went
jeremiah
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
to
mizpah
and
dwelt
with
him
among
the
people
that
were
left
in
the
land
40
7
now
when
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
which
were
in
the
fields
even
they
and
their
men
heard
that
the
king
of
babylon
had
made
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
governor
in
the
land
and
had
committed
unto
him
men
and
women
and
children
and
of
the
poor
of
the
land
of
them
that
were
not
carried
away
captive
to
babylon
40
8
then
they
came
to
gedaliah
to
mizpah
even
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
johanan
and
jonathan
the
sons
of
kareah
and
seraiah
the
son
of
tanhumeth
and
the
sons
of
ephai
the
netophathite
and
jezaniah
the
son
of
a
maachathite
they
and
their
men
40
9
and
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
sware
unto
them
and
to
their
men
saying
fear
not
to
serve
the
chaldeans
dwell
in
the
land
and
serve
the
king
of
babylon
and
it
shall
be
well
with
you
40
10
as
for
me
behold
i
will
dwell
at
mizpah
to
serve
the
chaldeans
which
will
come
unto
us
but
ye
gather
ye
wine
and
summer
fruits
and
oil
and
put
them
in
your
vessels
and
dwell
in
your
cities
that
ye
have
taken
40
11
likewise
when
all
the
jews
that
were
in
moab
and
among
the
ammonites
and
in
edom
and
that
were
in
all
the
countries
heard
that
the
king
of
babylon
had
left
a
remnant
of
judah
and
that
he
had
set
over
them
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
40
12
even
all
the
jews
returned
out
of
all
places
whither
they
were
driven
and
came
to
the
land
of
judah
to
gedaliah
unto
mizpah
and
gathered
wine
and
summer
fruits
very
much
40
13
moreover
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
in
the
fields
came
to
gedaliah
to
mizpah
40
14
and
said
unto
him
dost
thou
certainly
know
that
baalis
the
king
of
the
ammonites
hath
sent
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
to
slay
thee
but
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
believed
them
not
40
15
then
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
spake
to
gedaliah
in
mizpah
secretly
saying
let
me
go
i
pray
thee
and
i
will
slay
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
no
man
shall
know
it
wherefore
should
he
slay
thee
that
all
the
jews
which
are
gathered
unto
thee
should
be
scattered
and
the
remnant
in
judah
perish
40
16
but
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
said
unto
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
thou
shalt
not
do
this
thing
for
thou
speakest
falsely
of
ishmael
41
1
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
month
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
the
son
of
elishama
of
the
seed
royal
and
the
princes
of
the
king
even
ten
men
with
him
came
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
to
mizpah
and
there
they
did
eat
bread
together
in
mizpah
41
2
then
arose
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
the
ten
men
that
were
with
him
and
smote
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
with
the
sword
and
slew
him
whom
the
king
of
babylon
had
made
governor
over
the
land
41
3
ishmael
also
slew
all
the
jews
that
were
with
him
even
with
gedaliah
at
mizpah
and
the
chaldeans
that
were
found
there
and
the
men
of
war
41
4
and
it
came
to
pass
the
second
day
after
he
had
slain
gedaliah
and
no
man
knew
it
41
5
that
there
came
certain
from
shechem
from
shiloh
and
from
samaria
even
fourscore
men
having
their
beards
shaven
and
their
clothes
rent
and
having
cut
themselves
with
offerings
and
incense
in
their
hand
to
bring
them
to
the
house
of
the
lord
41
6
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
went
forth
from
mizpah
to
meet
them
weeping
all
along
as
he
went
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
met
them
he
said
unto
them
come
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
41
7
and
it
was
so
when
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
city
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
slew
them
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
the
pit
he
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
41
8
but
ten
men
were
found
among
them
that
said
unto
ishmael
slay
us
not
for
we
have
treasures
in
the
field
of
wheat
and
of
barley
and
of
oil
and
of
honey
so
he
forbare
and
slew
them
not
among
their
brethren
41
9
now
the
pit
wherein
ishmael
had
cast
all
the
dead
bodies
of
the
men
whom
he
had
slain
because
of
gedaliah
was
it
which
asa
the
king
had
made
for
fear
of
baasha
king
of
israel
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
filled
it
with
them
that
were
slain
41
10
then
ishmael
carried
away
captive
all
the
residue
of
the
people
that
were
in
mizpah
even
the
king’s
daughters
and
all
the
people
that
remained
in
mizpah
whom
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
committed
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
carried
them
away
captive
and
departed
to
go
over
to
the
ammonites
41
11
but
when
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
heard
of
all
the
evil
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
had
done
41
12
then
they
took
all
the
men
and
went
to
fight
with
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
found
him
by
the
great
waters
that
are
in
gibeon
41
13
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
all
the
people
which
were
with
ishmael
saw
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
then
they
were
glad
41
14
so
all
the
people
that
ishmael
had
carried
away
captive
from
mizpah
cast
about
and
returned
and
went
unto
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
41
15
but
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
escaped
from
johanan
with
eight
men
and
went
to
the
ammonites
41
16
then
took
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
all
the
remnant
of
the
people
whom
he
had
recovered
from
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
from
mizpah
after
that
he
had
slain
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
even
mighty
men
of
war
and
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
eunuchs
whom
he
had
brought
again
from
gibeon
41
17
and
they
departed
and
dwelt
in
the
habitation
of
chimham
which
is
by
bethlehem
to
go
to
enter
into
egypt
41
18
because
of
the
chaldeans
for
they
were
afraid
of
them
because
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
had
slain
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
whom
the
king
of
babylon
made
governor
in
the
land
42
1
then
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
and
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
jezaniah
the
son
of
hoshaiah
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
came
near
42
2
and
said
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
let
we
beseech
thee
our
supplication
be
accepted
before
thee
and
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
thy
god
even
for
all
this
remnant
(for
we
are
left
but
a
few
of
many
as
thine
eyes
do
behold
us
)
42
3
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
shew
us
the
way
wherein
we
may
walk
and
the
thing
that
we
may
do
42
4
then
jeremiah
the
prophet
said
unto
them
i
have
heard
you
behold
i
will
pray
unto
the
lord
your
god
according
to
your
words
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whatsoever
thing
the
lord
shall
answer
you
i
will
declare
it
unto
you
i
will
keep
nothing
back
from
you
42
5
then
they
said
to
jeremiah
the
lord
be
a
true
and
faithful
witness
between
us
if
we
do
not
even
according
to
all
things
for
the
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
send
thee
to
us
42
6
whether
it
be
good
or
whether
it
be
evil
we
will
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
to
whom
we
send
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
us
when
we
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
42
7
and
it
came
to
pass
after
ten
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
42
8
then
called
he
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
which
were
with
him
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
to
the
greatest
42
9
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
unto
whom
ye
sent
me
to
present
your
supplication
before
him
42
10
if
ye
will
still
abide
in
this
land
then
will
i
build
you
and
not
pull
you
down
and
i
will
plant
you
and
not
pluck
you
up
for
i
repent
me
of
the
evil
that
i
have
done
unto
you
42
11
be
not
afraid
of
the
king
of
babylon
of
whom
ye
are
afraid
be
not
afraid
of
him
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
with
you
to
save
you
and
to
deliver
you
from
his
hand
42
12
and
i
will
shew
mercies
unto
you
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
you
and
cause
you
to
return
to
your
own
land
42
13
but
if
ye
say
we
will
not
dwell
in
this
land
neither
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
42
14
saying
no
but
we
will
go
into
the
land
of
egypt
where
we
shall
see
no
war
nor
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
nor
have
hunger
of
bread
and
there
will
we
dwell
42
15
and
now
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
remnant
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
if
ye
wholly
set
your
faces
to
enter
into
egypt
and
go
to
sojourn
there
42
16
then
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
sword
which
ye
feared
shall
overtake
you
there
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
famine
whereof
ye
were
afraid
shall
follow
close
after
you
there
in
egypt
and
there
ye
shall
die
42
17
so
shall
it
be
with
all
the
men
that
set
their
faces
to
go
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
they
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
and
none
of
them
shall
remain
or
escape
from
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
them
42
18
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
as
mine
anger
and
my
fury
hath
been
poured
forth
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
so
shall
my
fury
be
poured
forth
upon
you
when
ye
shall
enter
into
egypt
and
ye
shall
be
an
execration
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
and
a
reproach
and
ye
shall
see
this
place
no
more
42
19
the
lord
hath
said
concerning
you
o
ye
remnant
of
judah
go
ye
not
into
egypt
know
certainly
that
i
have
admonished
you
this
day
42
20
for
ye
dissembled
in
your
hearts
when
ye
sent
me
unto
the
lord
your
god
saying
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
our
god
and
according
unto
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
say
so
declare
unto
us
and
we
will
do
it
42
21
and
now
i
have
this
day
declared
it
to
you
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
nor
any
thing
for
the
which
he
hath
sent
me
unto
you
42
22
now
therefore
know
certainly
that
ye
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
in
the
place
whither
ye
desire
to
go
and
to
sojourn
43
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
all
the
people
all
the
words
of
the
lord
their
god
for
which
the
lord
their
god
had
sent
him
to
them
even
all
these
words
43
2
then
spake
azariah
the
son
of
hoshaiah
and
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
proud
men
saying
unto
jeremiah
thou
speakest
falsely
the
lord
our
god
hath
not
sent
thee
to
say
go
not
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
43
3
but
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
setteth
thee
on
against
us
for
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
that
they
might
put
us
to
death
and
carry
us
away
captives
into
babylon
43
4
so
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
and
all
the
people
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
judah
43
5
but
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
took
all
the
remnant
of
judah
that
were
returned
from
all
nations
whither
they
had
been
driven
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
judah
43
6
even
men
and
women
and
children
and
the
king’s
daughters
and
every
person
that
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
left
with
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
and
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
43
7
so
they
came
into
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
thus
came
they
even
to
tahpanhes
43
8
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
in
tahpanhes
saying
43
9
take
great
stones
in
thine
hand
and
hide
them
in
the
clay
in
the
brickkiln
which
is
at
the
entry
of
pharaoh’s
house
in
tahpanhes
in
the
sight
of
the
men
of
judah
43
10
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
send
and
take
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
set
his
throne
upon
these
stones
that
i
have
hid
and
he
shall
spread
his
royal
pavilion
over
them
43
11
and
when
he
cometh
he
shall
smite
the
land
of
egypt
and
deliver
such
as
are
for
death
to
death
and
such
as
are
for
captivity
to
captivity
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword
to
the
sword
43
12
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
egypt
and
he
shall
burn
them
and
carry
them
away
captives
and
he
shall
array
himself
with
the
land
of
egypt
as
a
shepherd
putteth
on
his
garment
and
he
shall
go
forth
from
thence
in
peace
43
13
he
shall
break
also
the
images
of
bethshemesh
that
is
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
the
egyptians
shall
he
burn
with
fire
44
1
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
all
the
jews
which
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
which
dwell
at
migdol
and
at
tahpanhes
and
at
noph
and
in
the
country
of
pathros
saying
44
2
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
ye
have
seen
all
the
evil
that
i
have
brought
upon
jerusalem
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
behold
this
day
they
are
a
desolation
and
no
man
dwelleth
therein
44
3
because
of
their
wickedness
which
they
have
committed
to
provoke
me
to
anger
in
that
they
went
to
burn
incense
and
to
serve
other
gods
whom
they
knew
not
neither
they
ye
nor
your
fathers
44
4
howbeit
i
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
saying
oh
do
not
this
abominable
thing
that
i
hate
44
5
but
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
to
turn
from
their
wickedness
to
burn
no
incense
unto
other
gods
44
6
wherefore
my
fury
and
mine
anger
was
poured
forth
and
was
kindled
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
they
are
wasted
and
desolate
as
at
this
day
44
7
therefore
now
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
wherefore
commit
ye
this
great
evil
against
your
souls
to
cut
off
from
you
man
and
woman
child
and
suckling
out
of
judah
to
leave
you
none
to
remain
44
8
in
that
ye
provoke
me
unto
wrath
with
the
works
of
your
hands
burning
incense
unto
other
gods
in
the
land
of
egypt
whither
ye
be
gone
to
dwell
that
ye
might
cut
yourselves
off
and
that
ye
might
be
a
curse
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
44
9
have
ye
forgotten
the
wickedness
of
your
fathers
and
the
wickedness
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
the
wickedness
of
their
wives
and
your
own
wickedness
and
the
wickedness
of
your
wives
which
they
have
committed
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
44
10
they
are
not
humbled
even
unto
this
day
neither
have
they
feared
nor
walked
in
my
law
nor
in
my
statutes
that
i
set
before
you
and
before
your
fathers
44
11
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
set
my
face
against
you
for
evil
and
to
cut
off
all
judah
44
12
and
i
will
take
the
remnant
of
judah
that
have
set
their
faces
to
go
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
and
they
shall
all
be
consumed
and
fall
in
the
land
of
egypt
they
shall
even
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
they
shall
die
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
they
shall
be
an
execration
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
and
a
reproach
44
13
for
i
will
punish
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
as
i
have
punished
jerusalem
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
44
14
so
that
none
of
the
remnant
of
judah
which
are
gone
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
shall
escape
or
remain
that
they
should
return
into
the
land
of
judah
to
the
which
they
have
a
desire
to
return
to
dwell
there
for
none
shall
return
but
such
as
shall
escape
44
15
then
all
the
men
which
knew
that
their
wives
had
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
and
all
the
women
that
stood
by
a
great
multitude
even
all
the
people
that
dwelt
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
pathros
answered
jeremiah
saying
44
16
as
for
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
we
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
44
17
but
we
will
certainly
do
whatsoever
thing
goeth
forth
out
of
our
own
mouth
to
burn
incense
unto
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
as
we
have
done
we
and
our
fathers
our
kings
and
our
princes
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
for
then
had
we
plenty
of
victuals
and
were
well
and
saw
no
evil
44
18
but
since
we
left
off
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
we
have
wanted
all
things
and
have
been
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
44
19
and
when
we
burned
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
did
we
make
her
cakes
to
worship
her
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
without
our
men
44
20
then
jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
to
the
men
and
to
the
women
and
to
all
the
people
which
had
given
him
that
answer
saying
44
21
the
incense
that
ye
burned
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
ye
and
your
fathers
your
kings
and
your
princes
and
the
people
of
the
land
did
not
the
lord
remember
them
and
came
it
not
into
his
mind
44
22
so
that
the
lord
could
no
longer
bear
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
and
because
of
the
abominations
which
ye
have
committed
therefore
is
your
land
a
desolation
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
without
an
inhabitant
as
at
this
day
44
23
because
ye
have
burned
incense
and
because
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
nor
walked
in
his
law
nor
in
his
statutes
nor
in
his
testimonies
therefore
this
evil
is
happened
unto
you
as
at
this
day
44
24
moreover
jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
and
to
all
the
women
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
all
judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
egypt
44
25
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
ye
and
your
wives
have
both
spoken
with
your
mouths
and
fulfilled
with
your
hand
saying
we
will
surely
perform
our
vows
that
we
have
vowed
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
ye
will
surely
accomplish
your
vows
and
surely
perform
your
vows
44
26
therefore
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
all
judah
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
behold
i
have
sworn
by
my
great
name
saith
the
lord
that
my
name
shall
no
more
be
named
in
the
mouth
of
any
man
of
judah
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
saying
the
lord
god
liveth
44
27
behold
i
will
watch
over
them
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
all
the
men
of
judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
egypt
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
until
there
be
an
end
of
them
44
28
yet
a
small
number
that
escape
the
sword
shall
return
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
into
the
land
of
judah
and
all
the
remnant
of
judah
that
are
gone
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
shall
know
whose
words
shall
stand
mine
or
theirs
44
29
and
this

ye
may
know

my
words
shall
surely
stand
against

thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
pharaohhophra
king
of
egypt
into
the
hand
of
his
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
his
life
as
i
gave

king
of
judah
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
his
enemy
and
that
sought
his

the
word
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
when
he
had
written
these
words
in
a
book
at

mouth
of
jeremiah
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of

saying
45

thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
unto
thee
o
baruch
45
3
thou
didst
say
woe
is
me
now
for
the
lord
hath
added
grief
to
my
sorrow
i
fainted
in
my
sighing
and
i
find
no
rest
45
4
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
him
the
lord
saith
thus
behold
that
which
i
have
built
will
i
break
down
and
that
which
i
have
planted
i
will
pluck
up
even
this
whole
land
45

and
seekest
thou
great
things
for
thyself
seek
them
not
for
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
all
flesh
saith
the
lord
but
thy
life
will
i
give
unto
thee
for
a
prey
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest

against

against
the
army
of

let

nor
the
mighty
man

they
shall
stumble
and
fall
toward

who
is
this
that
cometh
up
as
a
flood
whose

46

egypt
riseth
up
like
a
flood
and
his
waters
are
moved
like
the
rivers
and
he
saith
i
will
go
up
and

i
will
destroy

thereof
46

come
forth
the

for
this
is
the
day
of

god
of

a
day
of
vengeance
that

may
avenge
him
of

and
the

shall
devour
and
it
shall
be
satiate
and

go

o

the

in

shalt
thou
use
many
medicines
for
thou
shalt
not
be
cured
46
12
the
nations
have
heard
of
thy
shame
and
thy
cry
hath
filled
the
land
for
the
mighty
man
hath
stumbled
against
the
mighty
and
they
are
fallen
both
together
46
13
the
word
that
the
lord
spake
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
how
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
should
come
and
smite
the
land
of

declare
ye
in

say
ye
stand
fast
and
prepare
thee
for
the
sword
shall
devour
round
about
thee
46
15
why
are
thy
valiant
men
swept
away
they
stood
not
because
the
lord
did
drive
them
46
16
he
made
many
to
fall
yea
one
fell
upon
another
and
they
said
arise
and
let
us
go
again
to
our
own
people
and
to
the
land
of
our
nativity
from
the
oppressing
sword
46
17
they
did
cry
there
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
is
but
a
noise
he
hath
passed
the
time
appointed
46
18
as
i
live
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
surely
as
tabor
is
among
the
mountains
and
as
carmel
by
the
sea
so
shall
he
come
46
19
o
thou
daughter
dwelling
in
egypt
furnish
thyself
to
go
into
captivity
for
noph
shall
be
waste
and
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
46
20
egypt
is
like
a
very
fair
heifer
but
destruction
cometh
it
cometh
out
of
the
north
46
21
also
her
hired
men
are
in
the
midst
of
her
like
fatted
bullocks
for
they
also
are
turned
back
and
are
fled
away
together
they
did
not
stand
because
the
day
of
their
calamity
was
come
upon
them
and
the
time
of
their
visitation
46
22
the
voice
thereof
shall
go
like
a
serpent
for
they
shall
march
with
an
army
and
come
against
her
with
axes
as
hewers
of
wood
46
23
they
shall
cut
down
her
forest
saith
the
lord
though
it
cannot
be
searched
because
they
are
more
than
the
grasshoppers
and
are
innumerable
46
24
the
daughter
of
egypt
shall
be
confounded
she
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
north
46
25
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saith
behold
i
will
punish
the
multitude
of
no
and
pharaoh
and
egypt
with
their
gods
and
their
kings
even
pharaoh
and
all
them
that
trust
in
him
46
26
and
i
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
lives
and
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
afterward
it
shall
be
inhabited
as
in
the
days
of
old
saith
the
lord
46
27
but
fear
not
thou
o
my
servant
jacob
and
be
not
dismayed
o
israel
for
behold
i
will
save
thee
from
afar
off
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
and
jacob
shall
return
and
be
in
rest
and
at
ease
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid
46
28
fear
thou
not
o
jacob
my
servant
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
with
thee
for
i
will
make
a
full
end
of
all
the
nations
whither
i
have
driven
thee
but
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee
but
correct
thee
in
measure
yet
will
i
not
leave
thee
wholly
unpunished

the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
against
the
philistines
before
that
pharaoh
smote
gaza
47
2
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
waters
rise
up
out
of
the
north
and
shall
be
an
overflowing
flood
and
shall
overflow
the
land
and
all
that
is
therein
the
city
and
them
that
dwell
therein
then
the
men
shall
cry
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
howl
47
3
at
the
noise
of
the
stamping
of
the
hoofs
of
his
strong
horses
at
the
rushing
of
his
chariots
and
at
the
rumbling
of
his
wheels
the
fathers
shall
not
look
back
to
their
children
for
feebleness
of
hands
47

because
of
the
day
that
cometh
to
spoil
all
the
philistines
and
to
cut
off
from
tyrus
and
zidon
every
helper
that
remaineth
for
the

spoil
the
philistines
the
remnant
of

baldness
is
come
upon
gaza
ashkelon
is
cut
off
with
the
remnant
of

valley
how
long
wilt
thou
cut
thyself
47

o
thou
sword
of
the
lord
how
long
will
it
be
ere
thou
be
quiet
put
up
thyself
into
thy
scabbard
rest
and
be
still
47
7
how
can
it
be
quiet
seeing
the
lord
hath
given
it
a
charge
against
ashkelon
and
against
the
sea
shore
there
hath
he
appointed
it
48
1
against
moab
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
woe
unto
nebo
for
it
is
spoiled
kiriathaim
is
confounded
and
taken
misgab
is
confounded
and
dismayed
48

there
shall
be
no
more
praise
of
moab
in
heshbon
they
have
devised
evil
against
it
come
and
let
us
cut
it
off
from
being
a
nation
also
thou
shalt
be
cut
down
o
madmen
the
sword
shall
pursue
thee
48

a
voice
of
crying
shall
be
from
horonaim
spoiling
and
great
destruction
48
4
moab
is
destroyed
her
little
ones
have
caused
a
cry
to
be
heard
48
5
for
in
the
going
up
of
luhith
continual
weeping
shall
go
up
for
in
the
going
down
of
horonaim
the
enemies
have
heard
a
cry
of
destruction
48
6
flee
save
your
lives
and
be
like
the
heath
in
the
wilderness
48
7
for
because
thou
hast
trusted
in
thy
works
and
in
thy
treasures
thou
shalt
also
be
taken
and
chemosh
shall
go
forth
into
captivity
with
his
priests
and
his
princes
together
48
8
and
the
spoiler
shall
come
upon
every
city
and
no
city
shall
escape
the
valley
also
shall
perish
and
the
plain
shall
be
destroyed
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
48
9
give
wings
unto
moab
that
it
may
flee
and
get
away
for
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
desolate
without
any
to
dwell
therein
48
10
cursed
be
he
that
doeth
the
work
of
the
lord
deceitfully
and
cursed
be
he
that
keepeth
back
his
sword
from
blood
48
11
moab
hath
been
at
ease
from
his
youth
and
he
hath
settled
on
his
lees
and
hath
not
been
emptied
from
vessel
to
vessel
neither
hath
he
gone
into
captivity
therefore
his
taste
remained
in
him
and
his
scent
is
not
changed
48
12
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
send
unto
him
wanderers
that
shall
cause
him
to
wander
and
shall
empty
his
vessels
and
break
their
bottles
48
13
and
moab
shall
be
ashamed
of
chemosh
as
the
house
of
israel
was
ashamed
of
bethel
their
confidence
48
14
how
say
ye
we
are
mighty
and
strong
men
for
the
war
48
15
moab
is
spoiled
and
gone
up
out
of
her
cities
and
his
chosen
young
men
are
gone
down
to
the
slaughter
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
48
16
the
calamity
of
moab
is
near
to
come
and
his
affliction
hasteth
fast
48
17
all
ye
that
are
about
him
bemoan
him
and
all
ye
that
know
his
name
say
how
is
the
strong
staff
broken
and
the
beautiful
rod
48
18
thou
daughter
that
dost
inhabit
dibon
come
down
from
thy
glory
and
sit
in
thirst
for
the
spoiler
of
moab
shall
come
upon
thee
and
he
shall
destroy
thy
strong
holds
48
19
o
inhabitant
of
aroer
stand
by
the
way
and
espy
ask
him
that
fleeth
and
her
that
escapeth
and
say
what
is
done
48
20
moab
is
confounded
for
it
is
broken
down
howl
and
cry
tell
ye
it
in
arnon
that
moab
is
spoiled
48
21
and
judgment
is
come
upon
the
plain
country
upon
holon
and
upon
jahazah
and
upon
mephaath
48
22
and
upon
dibon
and
upon
nebo
and
upon
bethdiblathaim
48
23
and
upon
kiriathaim
and
upon
bethgamul
and
upon
bethmeon
48
24
and
upon
kerioth
and
upon
bozrah
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
the
land
of
moab
far
or
near
48
25
the
horn
of
moab
is
cut
off
and
his
arm
is
broken
saith
the
lord
48
26
make
ye
him
drunken
for
he
magnified
himself
against
the
lord
moab
also
shall
wallow
in
his
vomit
and
he
also
shall
be
in
derision
48
27
for
was
not
israel
a
derision
unto
thee
was
he
found
among
thieves
for
since
thou
spakest
of
him
thou
skippedst
for
joy
48
28
o
ye
that
dwell
in
moab
leave
the
cities
and
dwell
in
the
rock
and
be
like
the
dove
that
maketh
her
nest
in
the
sides
of
the
hole’s
mouth
48
29
we
have
heard
the
pride
of
moab
(he
is
exceeding
proud)
his
loftiness
and
his
arrogancy
and
his
pride
and
the
haughtiness
of
his
heart
48
30
i
know
his
wrath
saith
the
lord
but
it
shall
not
be
so
his
lies
shall
not
so
effect
it
48
31
therefore
will
i
howl
for
moab
and
i
will
cry
out
for
all
moab
mine
heart
shall
mourn
for
the
men
of
kirheres
48
32
o
vine
of
sibmah
i
will
weep
for
thee
with
the
weeping
of
jazer
thy
plants
are
gone
over
the
sea
they
reach
even
to
the
sea
of
jazer
the
spoiler
is
fallen
upon
thy
summer
fruits
and
upon
thy
vintage
48
33
and
joy
and
gladness
is
taken
from
the
plentiful
field
and
from
the
land
of
moab
and
i
have
caused
wine
to
fail
from
the
winepresses
none
shall
tread
with
shouting
their
shouting
shall
be
no
shouting
48
34
from
the
cry
of
heshbon
even
unto
elealeh
and
even
unto
jahaz
have
they
uttered
their
voice
from
zoar
even
unto
horonaim
as
an
heifer
of
three
years
old
for
the
waters
also
of
nimrim
shall
be
desolate
48
35
moreover
i
will
cause
to
cease
in
moab
saith
the
lord
him
that
offereth
in
the
high
places
and
him
that
burneth
incense
to
his
gods
48
36
therefore
mine
heart
shall
sound
for
moab
like
pipes
and
mine
heart
shall
sound
like
pipes
for
the
men
of
kirheres
because
the
riches
that
he
hath
gotten
are
perished
48
37
for
every
head
shall
be
bald
and
every
beard
clipped
upon
all
the
hands
shall
be
cuttings
and
upon
the
loins
sackcloth
48
38
there
shall
be
lamentation
generally
upon
all
the
housetops
of
moab
and
in
the
streets
thereof
for
i
have
broken
moab
like
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
saith
the
lord
48
39
they
shall
howl
saying
how
is
it
broken
down
how
hath
moab
turned
the
back
with
shame
so
shall
moab
be
a
derision
and
a
dismaying
to
all
them
about
him
48
40
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
he
shall
fly
as
an
eagle
and
shall
spread
his
wings
over
moab
48
41
kerioth
is
taken
and
the
strong
holds
are
surprised
and
the
mighty
men’s
hearts
in
moab
at
that
day
shall
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs
48
42
and
moab
shall
be
destroyed
from
being
a
people
because
he
hath
magnified
himself
against
the
lord
48
43
fear
and
the
pit
and
the
snare
shall
be
upon
thee
o
inhabitant
of
moab
saith
the
lord
48
44
he
that
fleeth
from
the
fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit
and
he
that
getteth
up
out
of
the
pit
shall
be
taken
in
the
snare
for
i
will
bring
upon
it
even
upon
moab
the
year
of
their
visitation
saith
the
lord
48
45
they
that
fled
stood
under
the
shadow
of
heshbon
because
of
the
force
but
a
fire
shall
come

woe

thee
o

48
47
yet
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
moab
in
the
latter
days
saith
the
lord
thus
far
is
the
judgment
of
moab
49
1
concerning
the
ammonites
thus
saith
the
lord
hath
israel
no
sons
hath
he
no
heir
why
then
doth
their
king
inherit
gad
and
his
people
dwell
in
his
cities
49
2
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
cause
an
alarm
of
war
to
be
heard
in
rabbah
of
the
ammonites
and
it
shall
be
a
desolate
heap
and
her
daughters
shall
be
burned
with
fire
then
shall
israel
be
heir
unto
them
that
were
his
heirs
saith
the
lord
49

howl
o

for
ai
is

cry
ye
daughters
of
rabbah
gird
you
with
sackcloth
lament
and
run
to
and
fro
by
the
hedges
for
their
king
shall
go
into
captivity
and
his
priests
and
his
princes
together
49

wherefore
gloriest
thou
in
the
valleys
thy
flowing
valley
o
backsliding
daughter
that
trusted
in
her
treasures
saying
who
shall
come
unto
me
49
5
behold
i
will
bring
a
fear
upon
thee
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
from
all
those
that
be
about
thee
and
ye
shall
be
driven
out
every
man
right
forth
and
none
shall
gather
up
him
that
wandereth
49
6
and
afterward
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
the
children
of
ammon
saith
the
lord
49
7
concerning
edom
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
is
wisdom
no
more
in
teman
is
counsel
perished
from
the
prudent
is
their
wisdom
vanished
49
8
flee
ye
turn
back
dwell
deep
o
inhabitants
of
dedan
for
i
will
bring
the
calamity
of
esau
upon
him
the
time
that
i
will
visit
him
49
9
if
grapegatherers
come
to
thee
would
they
not
leave
some
gleaning
grapes
if
thieves
by
night
they
will
destroy
till
they
have
enough
49
10
but
i
have
made
esau
bare
i
have
uncovered
his
secret
places
and
he
shall
not
be
able
to
hide
himself
his
seed
is
spoiled
and
his
brethren
and
his
neighbours
and
he
is
not
49
11
leave
thy
fatherless
children
i
will
preserve
them
alive
and
let
thy
widows
trust
in
me
49
12
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
they
whose
judgment
was
not
to
drink
of
the
cup
have
assuredly
drunken
and
art
thou
he
that
shall
altogether
go
unpunished
thou
shalt
not
go
unpunished
but
thou
shalt
surely
drink
of
it
49
13
for
i
have
sworn
by
myself
saith
the
lord
that
bozrah
shall
become
a
desolation
a
reproach
a
waste
and
a
curse
and
all
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
perpetual
wastes
49
14
i
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
lord
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
unto
the
heathen
saying
gather
ye
together
and
come
against
her
and
rise
up
to
the
battle
49
15
for
lo
i
will
make
thee
small
among
the
heathen
and
despised
among
men
49
16
thy
terribleness
hath
deceived
thee
and
the
pride
of
thine
heart
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
that
holdest
the
height
of
the
hill
though
thou
shouldest
make
thy
nest
as
high
as
the
eagle
i
will
bring
thee
down
from
thence
saith
the
lord
49
17
also
edom
shall
be
a
desolation
every
one
that
goeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished
and
shall
hiss
at
all
the
plagues
thereof
49
18
as
in
the
overthrow
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof
saith
the
lord
no
man
shall
abide
there
neither
shall
a
son
of
man
dwell
in
it
49
19
behold
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
jordan
against
the
habitation
of
the
strong
but
i
will
suddenly
make
him
run
away
from
her
and
who
is
a
chosen
man
that
i
may
appoint
over
her
for
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me
49
20
therefore
hear
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
he
hath
taken
against
edom
and
his
purposes
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
inhabitants
of
teman
surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitations
desolate
with
them
49
21
the
earth
is
moved
at
the
noise
of
their
fall
at
the
cry
the
noise
thereof
was
heard
in
the
red
sea
49
22
behold
he
shall
come
up
and
fly
as
the
eagle
and
spread
his
wings
over
bozrah
and
at
that
day
shall
the
heart
of
the
mighty
men
of
edom
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs
49
23
concerning
damascus
hamath
is
confounded
and
arpad
for
they
have
heard
evil
tidings
they
are
fainthearted
there
is
sorrow
on
the
sea
it
cannot
be
quiet
49
24
damascus
is
waxed
feeble
and
turneth
herself
to
flee
and
fear
hath
seized
on
her
anguish
and
sorrows
have
taken
her
as
a
woman
in
travail
49
25
how
is
the
city
of
praise
not
left
the
city
of
my
joy
49
26
therefore
her
young
men
shall
fall
in
her
streets
and
all
the
men
of
war
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
49
27
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
wall
of
damascus
and
it
shall
consume
the
palaces
of
benhadad
49
28
concerning
kedar
and
concerning
the
kingdoms
of
hazor
which
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
shall
smite
thus
saith
the
lord
arise
ye
go
up
to
kedar
and
spoil
the
men
of
the
east
49
29
their
tents
and
their
flocks
shall
they
take
away
they
shall
take
to
themselves
their
curtains
and
all
their
vessels
and
their
camels
and
they
shall
cry
unto
them
fear
is
on
every
side
49
30
flee
get
you
far
off
dwell
deep
o
ye
inhabitants
of
hazor
saith
the
lord
for
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
hath
taken
counsel
against
you
and
hath
conceived
a
purpose
against
you
49
31
arise

you
up
unto
the
wealthy
nation
that
dwelleth
without
care
saith
the
lord
which

neither
gates
nor
bars
which

alone
49
32
and
their
camels
shall
be
a
booty
and
the
multitude
of
their
cattle
a
spoil
and
i
will
scatter
into
all
winds
them
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners
and
i
will
bring
their
calamity
from
all
sides
thereof
saith
the
lord
49
33
and
hazor
shall
be
a
dwelling
for
dragons
and
a
desolation
for
ever
there
shall
no
man
abide
there
nor
any
son
of
man
dwell
in
it
49
34
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
against
elam
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
saying
49
35
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
break
the
bow
of
elam
the
chief
of
their
might
49
36
and
upon
elam
will
i
bring
the
four
winds
from
the
four
quarters
of
heaven
and
will
scatter
them
toward
all
those
winds
and
there
shall
be
no
nation
whither
the
outcasts
of
elam
shall
not
come
49
37
for
i
will
cause
elam
to
be
dismayed
before
their
enemies
and
before
them
that
seek
their
life
and
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
even
my
fierce
anger
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
send
the
sword
after
them
till
i
have
consumed
them
49
38
and
i
will
set
my
throne
in
elam
and
will
destroy
from
thence
the
king
and
the
princes
saith
the
lord
49
39
but
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
latter
days
that
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
elam
saith
the
lord
50
1
the
word
that
the
lord
spake
against
babylon
and
against
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
by
jeremiah
the
prophet
50

for
out
of
the
north
there
cometh
up
a
nation
against
her
which

make
her
land
desolate
and
none
shall
dwell
therein
they

50

in
those
days
and
in
that
time
saith
the
lord
the
children
of
israel
shall
come
they
and
the
children
of
judah
together
going
and
weeping
they
shall
go
and
seek
the
lord
their
god
50
5
they
shall
ask
the
way
to
zion
with
their
faces
thitherward
saying
come
and
let
us
join
ourselves
to
the
lord
in
a
perpetual
covenant

to
go
astray
they

turned
them
away
on

gone
from

forgotten
their
restingplace
50

all
that
found
them
have
devoured
them
and
their
adversaries
said
we

not
because
they
have
sinned
against
the

the
habitation
of
justice
even
the
lord
the

50

remove
out
of
the
midst
of
babylon
and
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
and
be
as
the
he
goats
before
the
flocks
50
9
for
lo
i
will
raise
and
cause
to
come
up
against
babylon
an
assembly
of
great
nations
from
the
north
country
and
they
shall
set
themselves
in
array
against
her
from
thence
she
shall
be
taken
their
arrows
shall
be
as
of
a
mighty
expert
man
none
shall
return
in
vain
50
10
and
chaldea
shall
be
a
spoil
all
that
spoil
her
shall
be
satisfied
saith
the
lord
50
11
because
ye
were
glad
because
ye
rejoiced
o
ye
destroyers
of
mine
heritage
because
ye
are
grown
fat
as
the
heifer
at

and

as
bulls
50
12
your
mother
shall
be
sore
confounded
she
that
bare
you
shall
be
ashamed
behold
the
hindermost
of
the
nations
shall
be
a
wilderness
a
dry
land
and
a
desert
50
13
because
of
the
wrath
of
the
lord
it
shall
not
be
inhabited
but
it
shall
be
wholly
desolate
every
one
that
goeth
by
babylon
shall
be
astonished
and
hiss
at
all
her
plagues
50
14
put
yourselves
in
array
against
babylon
round
about
all
ye
that

her
spare
no
arrows
for
she
hath

against
her
round

as
she
hath
done

unto
her
50
16
cut
off
the
sower
from
babylon
and
him
that
handleth
the
sickle
in
the
time
of
harvest
for
fear
of
the
oppressing
sword
they
shall
turn
every
one
to
his
people
and
they
shall
flee
every
one
to
his
own
land
50
17
israel
is
a
scattered
sheep
the
lions
have
driven
him
away
first
the
king
of
assyria
hath
devoured
him
and
last
this
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
hath
broken
his
bones
50
18
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
punish
the
king
of
babylon
and
his
land
as
i
have
punished
the
king
of
assyria
50
19
and
i
will
bring
israel
again
to
his
habitation
and
he
shall
feed
on
carmel
and
bashan
and
his
soul
shall
be
satisfied
upon
mount
ephraim
and
gilead
50
20
in
those
days
and
in
that
time
saith
the
lord
the
iniquity
of
israel
shall
be
sought
for
and
there
shall
be
none
and
the
sins
of
judah
and
they
shall
not
be
found
for
i
will
pardon
them
whom
i
reserve
50
21
go
up
against
the
land
of
merathaim
even
against
it
and
against
the
inhabitants
of
pekod
waste
and
utterly
destroy
after
them
saith
the
lord
and
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
50
22
a
sound
of
battle
is
in
the
land
and
of
great
destruction
50
23
how
is
the
hammer
of
the
whole
earth
cut
asunder
and
broken
how
is
babylon
become
a
desolation
among
the
nations
50
24
i
have
laid
a
snare
for
thee
and
thou
art
also
taken
o
babylon
and
thou
wast
not
aware
thou
art
found
and
also
caught
because
thou
hast
striven
against
the
lord
50
25
the
lord
hath
opened
his
armoury
and
hath
brought
forth
the
weapons
of
his
indignation
for
this
is
the
work
of
the
lord
god
of
hosts
in
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
50
26
come
against
her
from
the
utmost
border
open
her
storehouses
cast
her
up
as
heaps
and
destroy
her
utterly
let
nothing
of
her
be
left
50
27
slay
all
her
bullocks
let
them
go
down
to
the
slaughter
woe
unto
them
for
their
day
is
come
the
time
of
their
visitation
50
28
the
voice
of
them
that
flee
and
escape
out
of
the
land
of
babylon
to
declare
in
zion
the
vengeance
of
the
lord
our
god
the
vengeance
of
his
temple
50
29
call
together
the
archers
against
babylon
all
ye
that
bend
the
bow
camp
against
it
round
about
let
none
thereof
escape
recompense
her
according
to
her
work
according
to
all
that
she
hath
done
do
unto
her
for
she
hath
been
proud
against
the
lord
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
50
30
therefore
shall
her
young
men
fall
in
the
streets
and
all
her
men
of
war
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
50
31
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
thou
most
proud
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
thy
day
is
come
the
time
that
i
will
visit
thee
50
32
and
the
most
proud
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
none
shall
raise
him
up
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
his
cities
and
it
shall
devour
all
round
about
him
50
33
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
judah
were
oppressed
together
and
all
that
took
them
captives
held
them
fast
they
refused
to
let
them
go
50
34
their
redeemer
is
strong
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
he
shall
throughly
plead
their
cause
that
he
may
give
rest
to
the
land
and
disquiet
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
50
35
a
sword
is
upon
the
chaldeans
saith
the
lord
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
and
upon
her
princes
and
upon
her
wise
men
50
36
a
sword
is
upon
the
liars
and
they
shall
dote
a
sword
is
upon
her
mighty
men
and
they
shall
be
dismayed
50
37
a
sword
is
upon
their
horses
and
upon
their
chariots
and
upon
all
the
mingled
people
that
are
in
the
midst
of
her
and
they
shall
become
as
women
a
sword
is
upon
her
treasures
and
they
shall
be
robbed
50
38
a
drought
is
upon
her
waters
and
they
shall
be
dried
up
for
it
is
the
land
of
graven
images
and
they
are
mad
upon
their
idols
50
39
therefore
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
dwell
there
and
the
owls
shall
dwell
therein
and
it
shall
be
no
more
inhabited
for
ever
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
50
40
as
god
overthrew
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof
saith
the
lord
so
shall
no
man
abide
there
neither
shall
any
son
of
man
dwell
therein
50
41
behold
a
people
shall
come
from
the
north
and
a
great
nation
and
many
kings
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
50
42
they
shall
hold
the
bow
and
the
lance
they
are
cruel
and
will
not
shew
mercy
their
voice
shall
roar
like
the
sea
and
they
shall
ride
upon
horses
every
one
put
in
array
like
a
man
to
the
battle
against
thee
o
daughter
of
babylon
50
43
the
king
of
babylon
hath
heard
the
report
of
them
and
his
hands
waxed
feeble
anguish
took
hold
of
him
and
pangs
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
50
44
behold
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
jordan
unto
the
habitation
of
the
strong
but
i
will
make
them
suddenly
run
away
from
her
and
who
is
a
chosen
man
that
i
may
appoint
over
her
for
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me
50
45
therefore
hear
ye
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
he
hath
taken
against
babylon
and
his
purposes
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitation
desolate
with
them
50
46
at
the
noise
of
the
taking
of
babylon
the
earth
is
moved
and
the
cry
is
heard
among
the
nations
51
1
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
raise
up
against
babylon
and
against
them
that
dwell
in
the
midst
of
them
that
rise
up
against
me
a
destroying
wind
51
2
and
will
send
unto
babylon
fanners
that
shall
fan
her
and
shall
empty
her
land
for
in
the
day
of
trouble
they
shall
be
against
her
round
about
51
3
against
him
that
bendeth
let
the
archer
bend
his
bow
and
against
him
that
lifteth
himself
up
in
his
brigandine
and
spare
ye
not
her
young
men
destroy
ye
utterly
all
her
host
51
4
thus
the
slain
shall
fall
in
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
and
they
that
are
thrust
through
in
her
streets
51
5
for
israel
hath
not
been
forsaken
nor
judah
of
his
god
of
the
lord
of
hosts
though
their
land
was
filled
with
sin
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
51
6
flee
out
of
the
midst
of
babylon
and
deliver
every
man
his
soul
be
not
cut
off
in
her
iniquity
for
this
is
the
time
of
the
lord’s
vengeance
he
will
render
unto
her
a
recompence
51
7
babylon
hath
been
a
golden
cup
in
the
lord’s
hand
that
made
all
the
earth
drunken
the
nations
have
drunken
of
her
wine
therefore
the
nations
are
mad
51
8
babylon
is
suddenly
fallen
and
destroyed
howl
for
her
take
balm
for
her
pain
if
so
be
she
may
be
healed
51
9
we
would
have
healed
babylon
but
she
is
not
healed
forsake
her
and
let
us
go
every
one
into
his
own
country
for
her
judgment
reacheth
unto
heaven
and
is
lifted
up
even
to
the
skies
51
10
the
lord
hath
brought
forth
our
righteousness
come
and
let
us
declare
in
zion
the
work
of
the
lord
our
god
51
11
make
bright
the
arrows
gather
the
shields
the
lord
hath
raised
up
the
spirit
of
the
kings
of
the
medes
for
his
device
is
against
babylon
to
destroy
it
because
it
is
the
vengeance
of
the
lord
the
vengeance
of
his
temple
51
12
set
up
the
standard
upon
the
walls
of
babylon
make
the
watch
strong
set
up
the
watchmen
prepare
the
ambushes
for
the
lord
hath
both
devised
and
done
that
which
he
spake
against
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
51
13
o
thou
that
dwellest
upon
many
waters
abundant
in
treasures
thine
end
is
come
and
the
measure
of
thy
covetousness
51
14
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sworn
by
himself
saying
surely
i
will
fill
thee
with
men
as
with
caterpillers
and
they
shall
lift
up
a
shout
against
thee
51
15
he
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heaven
by
his
understanding
51
16
when
he
uttereth
his
voice
there
is
a
multitude
of
waters
in
the
heavens
and
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain
and
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures
51
17
every
man
is
brutish
by
his
knowledge
every
founder
is
confounded
by
the
graven
image
for
his
molten
image
is
falsehood
and
there
is
no
breath
in
them
51
18
they
are
vanity
the
work
of
errors
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
perish
51
19
the
portion
of
jacob
is
not
like
them
for
he
is
the
former
of
all
things
and
israel
is
the
rod
of
his
inheritance
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
51
20
thou
art
my
battle
axe
and

of
war
for
with
thee
will
i
break
in
pieces
the
nations
and

i
break
in
pieces
the

51
23
i
will
also
break
in
pieces
with
thee
the
shepherd
and
his
flock
and
with
thee
will
i
break
in
pieces
the
husbandman
and
his
yoke
of
oxen
and
with
thee
will
i
break
in
pieces
captains
and
rulers
51
24
and
i
will
render
unto
babylon
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
chaldea
all
their
evil
that
they
have
done
in
zion
in
your
sight
saith
the
lord
51
25
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
destroying
mountain
saith
the
lord
which
destroyest
all
the
earth
and
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
thee
and
roll
thee
down
from
the
rocks
and
will
make
thee
a
burnt
mountain
51
26
and
they
shall
not
take
of
thee
a
stone
for
a
corner
nor
a
stone
for
foundations
but
thou
shalt
be
desolate
for
ever
saith
the
lord
51
27
set
ye
up
a
standard
in
the
land
blow
the
trumpet
among
the
nations
prepare
the
nations
against
her
call
together
against
her
the
kingdoms
of
ararat
minni
and
ashchenaz
appoint
a
captain
against
her
cause
the
horses
to
come
up
as
the
rough
caterpillers
51
28
prepare
against
her
the
nations
with
the
kings
of
the
medes
the
captains
thereof
and
all
the
rulers
thereof
and
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
51
29
and
the
land
shall
tremble
and
sorrow
for
every
purpose
of
the
lord
shall
be
performed
against
babylon
to
make
the
land
of
babylon
a
desolation
without
an
inhabitant
51
30
the
mighty
men
of
babylon
have
forborn
to
fight
they
have
remained
in
their
holds
their
might
hath
failed
they
became
as
women
they
have
burned
her
dwellingplaces
her
bars
are
broken
51
31
one
post
shall
run
to
meet
another
and
one
messenger
to
meet
another
to
shew
the
king
of
babylon
that
his
city
is
taken
at
one
end
51
32
and
that
the
passages
are
stopped
and
the
reeds
they
have
burned
with
fire
and
the
men
of
war
are
affrighted
51
33
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
the
daughter
of
babylon
is
like
a
threshingfloor
it
is
time
to
thresh
her
yet
a
little
while
and
the
time
of
her
harvest
shall
come
51
34
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
hath
devoured
me
he
hath
crushed
me
he
hath
made
me
an
empty
vessel
he
hath
swallowed
me
up
like
a
dragon
he
hath
filled
his
belly
with
my
delicates
he
hath
cast
me
out
51
35
the
violence
done
to
me
and
to
my
flesh
be
upon
babylon
shall
the
inhabitant
of
zion
say
and
my
blood
upon
the
inhabitants
of
chaldea
shall
jerusalem
say
51
36
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
plead
thy
cause
and
take
vengeance
for
thee
and
i
will
dry
up
her
sea
and
make
her
springs
dry
51
37
and
babylon
shall
become
heaps
a
dwellingplace
for
dragons
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
without
an
inhabitant
51
38
they
shall
roar
together
like
lions
they
shall
yell
as
lions’
whelps
51
39
in
their
heat
i
will
make
their
feasts
and
i
will
make
them
drunken
that
they
may
rejoice
and
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep
and
not
wake
saith
the
lord
51
40
i
will
bring
them
down
like
lambs
to
the
slaughter
like
rams
with
he
goats
51
41
how
is
sheshach
taken
and
how
is
the
praise
of
the
whole
earth
surprised
how
is
babylon
become
an
astonishment
among
the
nations
51
42
the
sea
is
come
up
upon
babylon
she
is
covered
with
the
multitude
of
the
waves
thereof
51
43
her
cities
are
a
desolation
a
dry
land
and
a
wilderness
a
land
wherein
no
man
dwelleth
neither
doth
any
son
of
man
pass
thereby
51
44
and
i
will
punish
bel
in
babylon
and
i
will
bring
forth
out
of
his
mouth
that
which
he
hath
swallowed
up
and
the
nations
shall
not
flow
together
any
more
unto
him
yea
the
wall
of
babylon
shall
fall
51
45
my
people
go
ye
out
of
the
midst
of
her
and
deliver
ye
every
man
his
soul
from
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
51
46
and
lest
your
heart
faint
and
ye
fear
for
the
rumour
that
shall
be
heard
in
the
land
a
rumour
shall
both
come
one
year
and
after
that
in
another
year
shall
come
a
rumour
and
violence
in
the
land
ruler
against
ruler
51
47
therefore
behold
the
days
come
that
i
will
do
judgment
upon
the
graven
images
of
babylon
and
her
whole
land
shall
be
confounded
and
all
her
slain
shall
fall
in
the
midst
of
her
51
48
then
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
all
that
is
therein
shall
sing
for
babylon
for
the
spoilers
shall
come
unto
her
from
the
north
saith
the
lord
51
49
as
babylon
hath
caused
the
slain
of
israel
to
fall
so
at
babylon
shall
fall
the
slain
of
all
the
earth
51
50
ye
that
have
escaped
the
sword
go
away
stand
not
still
remember
the
lord
afar
off
and
let
jerusalem
come
into
your
mind
51
51
we
are
confounded
because
we
have
heard
reproach
shame
hath
covered
our
faces
for
strangers
are
come
into
the
sanctuaries
of
the
lord’s
house
51
52
wherefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
do
judgment
upon
her
graven
images
and
through
all
her
land
the
wounded
shall
groan
51
53
though
babylon
should
mount
up
to
heaven
and
though
she
should
fortify
the
height
of
her
strength
yet
from
me
shall
spoilers
come
unto
her
saith
the
lord
51
54
a
sound
of
a
cry
cometh
from
babylon
and
great
destruction
from
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
51
55
because
the
lord
hath
spoiled
babylon
and
destroyed
out
of
her
the
great
voice
when
her
waves
do
roar
like
great
waters
a
noise
of
their
voice
is
uttered
51
56
because
the
spoiler
is
come
upon
her
even
upon
babylon
and
her
mighty
men
are
taken
every
one
of
their
bows
is
broken
for
the
lord
god
of
recompences
shall
surely
requite
51
57
and
i
will
make
drunk
her
princes
and
her
wise
men
her
captains
and
her
rulers
and
her
mighty
men
and
they
shall
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep
and
not
wake
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
51
58
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
broad
walls
of
babylon
shall
be
utterly
broken
and
her
high
gates
shall
be
burned
with
fire
and
the
people
shall
labour
in
vain
and
the
folk
in
the
fire
and
they
shall
be
weary
51
59
the
word
which
jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
seraiah
the
son
of
neriah
the
son
of
maaseiah
when
he
went
with
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
into
babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
and
this
seraiah
was
a
quiet
prince
51
60
so
jeremiah
wrote
in
a
book
all
the
evil
that
should
come
upon
babylon
even
all
these
words
that
are
written
against
babylon
51
61
and
jeremiah
said
to
seraiah
when
thou
comest
to
babylon
and
shalt
see
and
shalt
read
all
these
words
51
62
then
shalt
thou
say
o
lord
thou
hast
spoken
against
this
place
to
cut
it
off
that
none
shall
remain
in
it
neither
man
nor
beast
but
that
it
shall
be
desolate
for
ever
51
63
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
reading
this
book
that
thou
shalt
bind
a
stone
to
it
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
euphrates
51
64
and
thou
shalt
say
thus
shall
babylon
sink
and
shall
not
rise
from
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
her
and
they
shall
be
weary
thus
far
are
the
words
of
jeremiah
52
1
zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother’s
name
was
hamutal
the
daughter
of
jeremiah
of
libnah
52
2
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
jehoiakim
had
done
52
3
for
through
the
anger
of
the
lord
it
came
to
pass
in
jerusalem
and
judah
till
he
had
cast
them
out
from
his
presence
that
zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of
babylon
52
4
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninth
year
of
his
reign
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
that
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
came
he
and
all
his
army
against
jerusalem
and
pitched
against
it
and
built
forts
against
it
round
about
52
5
so
the
city
was
besieged
unto
the
eleventh
year
of
king
zedekiah
52
6
and
in
the
fourth
month
in
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
city
so
that
there
was
no
bread
for
the
people
of
the
land
52
7
then
the
city
was
broken
up
and
all
the
men
of
war
fled
and
went
forth
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
gate
between
the
two
walls
which
was
by
the
king’s
garden
(now
the
chaldeans
were
by
the
city
round
about
)
and
they
went
by
the
way
of
the
plain
52
8
but
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
pursued
after
the
king
and
overtook
zedekiah
in
the
plains
of
jericho
and
all
his
army
was
scattered
from
him
52
9
then
they
took
the
king

of
her
miseries
all
her
pleasant
things
that
she

her
and

mock
at

sigheth
and
turneth
backward
1

her
filthiness
is
in
her
skirts

affliction
for
the
enemy
hath
magnified
himself
1
10
the
adversary
hath
spread
out
his
hand
upon
all
her
pleasant
things
for
she
hath
seen
that
the
heathen
entered
into
her
sanctuary
whom
thou
didst
command
that
they
should
not
enter
into
thy
congregation
1
11
all
her
people

seek
bread
they
have
given
their
pleasant
things
for
meat
to
relieve
the
soul

unto
me
wherewith

lord
hath
afflicted
me
in
the
day
of
his
fierce
anger
1
13
from

he
sent
fire
into
my
bones
and
it
prevaileth
against
them
he
hath
spread
a
net
for
my
feet
he
hath
turned
me
back
he
hath
made
me
desolate
and

delivered
me
into
their
hands
from

a
winepress
1
16
for
these
things
i

runneth
down
with
water
because
the
comforter
that

relieve
my
soul

desolate
because

how
hath
the
lord
covered
the
daughter
of
zion
with
a
cloud
in
his
anger
and
cast
down
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
the
beauty
of
israel
and

brought
them
down
to
the
ground

hath
polluted

hath
cut
off
in
his
fierce
anger
all
the
horn
of
israel
he
hath
drawn
back
his
right
hand
from
before
the
enemy
and
he
burned
against
jacob
like
a
flaming
fire
which
devoureth
round
about
2
4
he
hath
bent
his
bow
like
an
enemy
he
stood
with
his
right
hand
as
an
adversary
and
slew
all
that
were
pleasant
to
the
eye
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
daughter
of
zion

poured
out
his
fury
like

hath
destroyed
his
strong
holds
and
hath
increased
in
the
daughter
of

mourning
and
lamentation
2

hath
violently
taken
away
his
tabernacle
as
if

were
of
a
garden

hath
destroyed
his
places
of
the
assembly
the
lord
hath
caused
the
solemn
feasts
and
sabbaths
to
be
forgotten
in
zion
and
hath
despised
in
the
indignation
of
his
anger
the
king
and
the
priest
2
7
the
lord
hath
cast
off
his
altar
he
hath
abhorred
his
sanctuary
he
hath
given
up
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
the
walls
of
her
palaces
they
have
made
a
noise
in
the
house
of
the
lord
as
in
the
day
of
a
solemn
feast
2
8
the
lord
hath
purposed
to
destroy
the
wall
of
the
daughter
of
zion
he
hath
stretched
out
a
line
he
hath
not
withdrawn
his
hand
from
destroying
therefore
he
made
the
rampart
and
the
wall
to
lament
they
languished
together
2
9
her
gates
are
sunk
into
the
ground
he
hath
destroyed
and
broken
her
bars
her
king
and
her
princes
are
among
the
gentiles
the
law

2
10
the

sit
upon
the
ground
and
keep
silence
they
have
cast
up
dust
upon
their
heads
they
have
girded
themselves
with
sackcloth
the
virgins
of
jerusalem
hang
down
their
heads
to
the
ground
2
11
mine
eyes
do
fail
with
tears
my
bowels
are
troubled
my
liver
is
poured
upon
the
earth
for
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
because
the
children
and
the
sucklings
swoon
in
the
streets
of
the
city
2
12
they
say
to
their
mothers
where
is
corn
and
wine
when
they
swooned
as
the
wounded
in
the
streets
of
the
city
when
their
soul
was
poured
out
into
their
mothers’
bosom
2
13
what
thing
shall
i
take
to
witness
for
thee
what
thing
shall
i
liken
to
thee
o
daughter
of
jerusalem
what
shall
i
equal
to
thee
that
i
may
comfort
thee
o
virgin
daughter
of
zion
for
thy
breach
is
great
like
the
sea
who
can
heal
thee
2
14
thy
prophets
have
seen
vain
and
foolish
things
for
thee
and
they
have
not
discovered
thine
iniquity
to
turn
away
thy
captivity
but
have
seen
for
thee
false
burdens
and
causes
of
banishment
2
15
all
that
pass
by
clap
their
hands
at
thee
they
hiss
and
wag
their
head
at
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
saying
is
this
the
city
that
men
call
the
perfection
of
beauty
the
joy
of
the
whole
earth
2
16
all
thine
enemies
have
opened
their
mouth
against
thee
they
hiss
and
gnash
the
teeth
they
say
we
have
swallowed
her
up
certainly
this
is
the
day
that
we
looked
for
we
have
found
we
have
seen
it
2
17
the
lord
hath
done
that
which
he
had
devised
he
hath
fulfilled
his
word
that
he
had
commanded
in
the
days
of
old
he
hath
thrown
down
and
hath
not
pitied
and
he
hath
caused
thine
enemy
to
rejoice
over
thee
he
hath
set
up
the
horn
of
thine
adversaries
2
18
their
heart
cried
unto
the
lord
o
wall
of
the
daughter
of
zion
let
tears
run
down
like
a
river
day
and
night
give
thyself
no
rest
let
not
the
apple
of
thine
eye
cease
2
19
arise
cry
out
in
the
night
in
the
beginning
of
the
watches
pour
out
thine
heart
like
water
before
the
face
of
the
lord
lift
up
thy
hands
toward
him
for
the
life
of
thy
young
children
that
faint
for
hunger
in
the
top
of
every
street
2
20
behold
o
lord
and
consider
to
whom
thou
hast
done
this
shall
the
women
eat
their
fruit
and
children
of
a
span
long
shall
the
priest
and
the
prophet
be
slain
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
2
21
the
young
and
the
old
lie
on
the
ground
in
the
streets
my
virgins
and
my
young
men
are
fallen
by
the
sword
thou
hast
slain
them
in
the
day
of
thine
anger
thou
hast
killed
and
not
pitied
2
22
thou
hast
called
as
in
a
solemn
day
my
terrors
round
about
so
that
in
the
day
of
the
lord’s
anger
none
escaped
nor
remained
those
that
i
have
swaddled
and
brought
up
hath
mine
enemy
consumed
3
1
i
am
the
man
that
hath
seen
affliction
by
the
rod
of
his
wrath
3
2
he
hath
led
me
and
brought
me
into
darkness
but
not
into
light
3
3
surely
against
me
is
he
turned
he
turneth
his
hand
against
me
all
the
day
3
4
my
flesh
and
my
skin
hath
he
made
old
he
hath
broken
my
bones
3
5
he
hath
builded
against
me
and
compassed
me
with
gall
and
travail
3
6
he
hath
set
me
in
dark
places
as
they
that
be
dead
of
old
3
7
he
hath
hedged
me
about
that
i
cannot
get
out
he
hath
made
my
chain
heavy
3
8
also
when
i
cry
and
shout
he
shutteth
out
my
prayer
3
9
he
hath
inclosed
my
ways
with
hewn
stone
he
hath
made
my
paths
crooked
3
10
he
was
unto
me
as
a
bear
lying
in
wait
and
as
a
lion
in
secret
places
3
11
he
hath
turned
aside
my
ways
and
pulled
me
in
pieces
he
hath
made
me
desolate
3
12
he
hath
bent
his
bow
and
set
me
as
a
mark
for
the
arrow
3
13
he
hath
caused
the
arrows
of
his
quiver
to
enter
into
my
reins
3
14
i
was
a
derision
to
all
my
people
and
their
song
all
the
day
3
15
he
hath
filled
me
with
bitterness
he
hath
made
me
drunken
with
wormwood
3
16
he
hath
also
broken
my
teeth
with
gravel
stones
he
hath
covered
me
with
ashes
3
17
and
thou
hast
removed
my
soul
far
off
from
peace
i
forgat
prosperity
3
18
and
i
said
my
strength
and
my
hope
is
perished
from
the
lord
3
19
remembering
mine
affliction
and
my
misery
the
wormwood
and
the
gall
3
20
my
soul
hath
them
still
in
remembrance
and
is
humbled
in
me
3
21
this
i
recall
to
my
mind
therefore
have
i
hope
3
22
it
is
of
the
lord’s
mercies
that
we
are
not
consumed
because
his
compassions
fail
not
3
23
they
are
new
every
morning
great
is
thy
faithfulness
3
24
the
lord
is
my
portion
saith
my
soul
therefore
will
i
hope
in
him
3
25
the
lord
is
good
unto
them
that
wait
for
him
to
the
soul
that
seeketh
him
3
26
it
is
good
that
a
man
should
both
hope
and
quietly
wait
for
the
salvation
of
the
lord
3
27
it
is
good
for
a
man
that
he
bear
the
yoke
of
his
youth
3
28
he
sitteth
alone
and
keepeth
silence
because
he
hath
borne
it
upon
him
3
29
he
putteth
his
mouth
in
the
dust
if
so
be
there
may
be
hope
3
30
he
giveth
his
cheek
to
him
that
smiteth
him
he
is
filled
full
with
reproach
3
31
for
the
lord
will
not
cast
off
for
ever
3
32
but
though
he
cause
grief
yet
will
he
have
compassion
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
mercies
3
33
for
he
doth
not
afflict
willingly
nor
grieve
the
children
of
men
3
34
to
crush
under
his
feet
all
the
prisoners
of
the
earth
3
35
to
turn
aside
the
right
of
a
man
before
the
face
of
the
most
high
3
36
to
subvert
a
man
in
his
cause
the
lord
approveth
not
3
37
who
is
he
that
saith
and
it
cometh
to
pass
when
the
lord
commandeth
it
not
3
38
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
most
high
proceedeth
not
evil
and
good
3
39
wherefore
doth
a
living
man
complain
a
man
for
the
punishment
of
his
sins
3
40
let
us
search
and
try
our
ways
and
turn
again
to
the
lord
3
41
let
us
lift
up
our
heart
with
our
hands
unto
god
in
the
heavens
3
42
we
have
transgressed
and
have
rebelled
thou
hast
not
pardoned
3
43
thou
hast
covered
with
anger
and
persecuted
us
thou
hast
slain
thou
hast
not
pitied
3
44
thou
hast
covered
thyself
with
a
cloud
that
our
prayer
should
not
pass
through
3
45
thou
hast
made
us
as
the
offscouring
and
refuse
in
the
midst
of
the
people
3
46
all
our
enemies
have
opened
their
mouths
against
us
3
47
fear
and
a
snare
is
come
upon
us
desolation
and
destruction
3
48
mine
eye
runneth
down
with
rivers
of
water
for
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
3
49
mine
eye
trickleth
down
and
ceaseth
not
without
any
intermission
3
50
till
the
lord
look
down
and
behold
from
heaven
3
51
mine
eye
affecteth
mine
heart
because
of
all
the
daughters
of
my
city
3
52
mine
enemies
chased
me
sore
like
a
bird
without
cause
3
53
they
have
cut
off
my
life
in
the
dungeon
and
cast
a
stone
upon
me
3
54
waters
flowed
over
mine
head
then
i
said
i
am
cut
off
3
55
i
called
upon
thy
name
o
lord
out
of
the
low
dungeon
3
56
thou
hast
heard
my
voice
hide
not
thine
ear
at
my
breathing
at
my
cry
3
57
thou
drewest
near
in
the
day
that
i
called
upon
thee
thou
saidst
fear
not
3
58
o
lord
thou
hast
pleaded
the
causes
of
my
soul
thou
hast
redeemed
my
life
3
59
o
lord
thou
hast
seen
my
wrong
judge
thou
my
cause
3
60
thou
hast
seen
all
their
vengeance
and
all
their
imaginations
against
me
3
61
thou
hast
heard
their
reproach
o
lord
and
all
their
imaginations
against
me
3
62
the
lips
of
those
that
rose
up
against
me
and
their
device
against
me
all
the
day
3
63
behold
their
sitting
down
and
their
rising
up
i
am
their
musick
3
64
render
unto
them
a
recompence
o
lord
according
to
the
work
of
their
hands
3
65
give
them
sorrow
of
heart
thy
curse
unto
them
3
66
persecute
and
destroy
them
in
anger
from
under
the
heavens

most
fine
gold
changed

out

the

even
the
sea
monsters
draw
out
the
breast
they
give

to

ones
the
daughter
of

people
is
become
cruel
like
the
ostriches
in

wilderness

the
tongue
of
the
sucking
child

they
that
did

they
that

brought
up
in
scarlet
embrace
dunghills
4
6
for
the
punishment
of
the
iniquity
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
is
greater
than
the
punishment
of
the
sin
of
sodom
that
was
overthrown
as
in
a
moment
and
no
hands
stayed
on
her
4

her
nazarites
were
purer
than
snow
they
were
whiter

milk
they
were
more
ruddy
in
body
than
rubies
their
polishing
was
of
sapphire
4

their
visage
is
blacker
than
a
coal
they
are
not
known
in

streets
their
skin
cleaveth
to
their
bones
it
is
withered
it
is
become
like
a
stick
4

they
that
be
slain
with
the
sword
are
better
than
they
that
be
slain
with
hunger
for
these
pine
away
stricken
through
for
want
of
the
fruits
of
the
field
4

the
hands
of
the
pitiful
women
have
sodden
their
own
children
they
were
their
meat
in
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
4
11
the
lord
hath
accomplished
his
fury
he
hath
poured
out
his
fierce
anger
and
hath
kindled
a
fire
in
zion
and
it
hath
devoured
the
foundations
thereof
4
12
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
would
not
have
believed
that
the
adversary
and
the
enemy
should
have
entered
into
the
gates
of
jerusalem
4
13
for
the
sins
of
her
prophets
and
the
iniquities
of
her
priests
that
have
shed
the
blood
of
the
just
in
the
midst
of
her
4
14
they
have
wandered
as
blind
men
in
the
streets
they
have
polluted
themselves
with
blood
so
that
men
could
not
touch
their
garments
4

they
cried
unto
them
depart
ye
it
is
unclean
depart
depart
touch
not
when
they
fled
away
and
wandered
they
said
among
the
heathen
they
shall
no
more
sojourn
there
4
16
the
anger
of
the
lord
hath
divided
them
he
will
no
more
regard
them
they
respected
not
the
persons
of
the
priests
they
favoured
not
the
elders
4
17
as
for
us
our
eyes
as
yet
failed
for
our
vain
help
in
our
watching
we
have
watched
for
a
nation
that
could
not
save
us
4
18
they
hunt
our
steps
that
we
cannot
go
in
our
streets
our
end
is
near
our
days
are
fulfilled
for
our
end
is
come
4

our
persecutors
are
swifter
than
the
eagles
of

heaven
they
pursued
us
upon
the
mountains
they
laid
wait
for
us
in
the
wilderness
4
20
the
breath
of
our
nostrils
the
anointed
of
the
lord
was
taken
in

pits

under

shadow
we
shall
live

rejoice

the
punishment
of
thine
iniquity

will
no

thee

have
drunken
our
water

wood
is
sold
unto
us
5
5
our
necks
are
under
persecution
we
labour
and
have
no
rest
5

we
have
given
the
hand
to
the
egyptians
and
to
the
assyrians
to
be
satisfied
with
bread
5
7
our
fathers
have
sinned
and
are
not
and
we
have
borne
their
iniquities
5
8
servants
have
ruled
over
us
there
is
none
that
doth
deliver
us
out
of
their
hand
5
9
we
gat
our
bread
with
the
peril
of
our
lives
because
of
the
sword
of
the
wilderness
5
10
our
skin
was
black
like
an
oven
because
of
the
terrible
famine

11
they
ravished
the
women
in
zion
and
the
maids
in
the
cities
of
judah
5
12
princes
are
hanged
up
by
their
hand
the
faces
of

were
not
honoured
5

they
took
the
young
men
to
grind
and
the
children
fell
under
the
wood
5
14
the
elders
have
ceased
from
the
gate
the
young
men
from
their
musick
5
15
the
joy
of
our
heart
is
ceased
our
dance
is
turned
into
mourning

the
crown
is
fallen
from
our
head

unto
us
that
we
have
sinned
5
17
for
this
our
heart
is
faint
for
these
things
our
eyes
are
dim
5
18
because
of
the
mountain
of
zion
which
is
desolate
the
foxes
walk
upon
it
5
19
thou
o
lord
remainest
for
ever
thy
throne
from
generation
to
generation
5
20
wherefore
dost
thou
forget
us
for
ever
and
forsake
us
so
long
time
5
21
turn
thou
us
unto
thee
o
lord
and
we
shall
be
turned

our
days
as
of
old

thou
hast
utterly
rejected
us
thou
art
very
wroth
against
us
the
book

now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
in
the
fourth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
as
i
was
among
the
captives
by
the
river
of
chebar
that
the
heavens
were
opened
and
i
saw
visions
of
god
1
2
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
which
was
the
fifth
year
of
king
jehoiachin’s
captivity
1
3
the
word
of
the
lord
came
expressly
unto
ezekiel
the
priest
the
son
of
buzi
in
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
by
the
river
chebar
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
there
upon
him
1
4
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
whirlwind
came
out
of
the
north
a
great
cloud
and
a
fire
infolding
itself
and
a
brightness
was
about
it
and
out
of
the
midst
thereof
as
the
colour
of
amber
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
1
5
also
out
of
the
midst
thereof
came
the
likeness
of
four
living
creatures
and
this
was
their
appearance
they
had
the
likeness
of
a
man
1
6
and
every
one
had
four
faces
and
every
one
had
four
wings
1
7
and
their
feet
were
straight
feet
and
the
sole
of
their
feet
was
like
the
sole
of
a
calf’s
foot
and
they
sparkled
like
the
colour
of
burnished
brass
1
8
and
they
had
the
hands
of
a
man
under
their
wings
on
their
four
sides
and
they
four
had
their
faces
and
their
wings
1
9
their
wings
were
joined
one
to
another
they
turned
not
when
they
went
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
1
10
as
for
the
likeness
of
their
faces
they
four
had
the
face
of
a
man
and
the
face
of
a
lion
on
the
right
side
and
they
four
had
the
face
of
an
ox
on
the
left
side
they
four
also
had
the
face
of
an
eagle
1
11
thus
were
their
faces
and
their
wings
were
stretched
upward
two
wings
of
every
one
were
joined
one
to
another
and
two
covered
their
bodies
1
12
and
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
whither
the
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went
1
13
as
for
the
likeness
of
the
living
creatures
their
appearance
was
like
burning
coals
of
fire
and
like
the
appearance
of
lamps
it
went
up
and
down
among
the
living
creatures
and
the
fire
was
bright
and
out
of
the
fire
went
forth
lightning
1
14
and
the
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
as
the
appearance
of
a
flash
of
lightning
1
15
now
as
i
beheld
the
living
creatures
behold
one
wheel
upon
the
earth
by
the
living
creatures
with
his
four
faces
1
16
the
appearance
of
the
wheels
and
their
work
was
like
unto
the
colour
of
a
beryl
and
they
four
had
one
likeness
and
their
appearance
and
their
work
was
as
it
were
a
wheel
in
the
middle
of
a
wheel
1
17
when
they
went
they
went
upon
their
four
sides
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went
1
18
as
for
their
rings
they
were
so
high
that
they
were
dreadful
and
their
rings
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
them
four
1
19
and
when
the
living
creatures
went
the
wheels
went
by
them
and
when
the
living
creatures
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
1
20
whithersoever
the
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
thither
was
their
spirit
to
go
and
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels
1
21
when
those
went
these
went
and
when
those
stood
these
stood
and
when
those
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels
1
22
and
the
likeness
of
the
firmament
upon
the
heads
of
the
living
creature
was
as
the
colour
of
the
terrible
crystal
stretched
forth
over
their
heads
above
1
23
and
under
the
firmament
were
their
wings
straight
the
one
toward
the
other
every
one
had
two
which
covered
on
this
side
and
every
one
had
two
which
covered
on
that
side
their
bodies
1
24
and
when
they
went
i
heard
the
noise
of
their
wings
like
the
noise
of
great
waters
as
the
voice
of
the
almighty
the
voice
of
speech
as
the
noise
of
an
host
when
they
stood
they
let
down
their
wings
1
25
and
there
was
a
voice
from
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads
when
they
stood
and
had
let
down
their
wings
1
26
and
above
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads
was
the
likeness
of
a
throne
as
the
appearance
of
a
sapphire
stone
and
upon
the
likeness
of
the
throne
was
the
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
a
man
above
upon
it
1
27
and
i
saw
as
the
colour
of
amber
as
the
appearance
of
fire
round
about
within
it
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
upward
and
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward
i
saw
as
it
were
the
appearance
of
fire
and
it
had
brightness
round
about
1
28
as
the
appearance
of
the
bow
that
is
in
the
cloud
in
the
day
of
rain
so
was
the
appearance
of
the
brightness
round
about
this
was
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
when
i
saw
it
i
fell
upon
my
face
and
i
heard
a
voice
of
one
that
spake
2
1
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
stand
upon
thy
feet
and
i
will
speak
unto
thee
2
2
and
the
spirit
entered
into
me
when
he
spake
unto
me
and
set
me
upon
my
feet
that
i
heard
him
that
spake
unto
me
2
3
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
i
send
thee
to
the
children
of
israel
to
a
rebellious
nation
that
hath
rebelled
against
me
they
and
their
fathers
have
transgressed
against
me
even
unto
this
very
day
2
4
for
they
are
impudent
children
and
stiffhearted
i
do
send
thee
unto
them
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
2
5
and
they
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
(for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
)
yet
shall
know
that
there
hath
been
a
prophet
among
them
2
6
and
thou
son
of
man
be
not
afraid
of
them
neither
be
afraid
of
their
words
though
briers
and
thorns
be
with
thee
and
thou
dost
dwell
among
scorpions
be
not
afraid
of
their
words
nor
be
dismayed
at
their
looks
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
2
7
and
thou
shalt
speak
my
words
unto
them
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
for
they
are
most
rebellious
2
8
but
thou
son
of
man
hear
what
i
say
unto
thee
be
not
thou
rebellious
like
that
rebellious
house
open
thy
mouth
and
eat
that
i
give
thee
2
9
and
when
i
looked
behold
an
hand
was
sent
unto
me
and
lo
a
roll
of
a
book
was
therein
2
10
and
he
spread
it
before
me
and
it
was
written
within
and
without
and
there
was
written
therein
lamentations
and
mourning
and
woe
3
1
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
eat
that
thou
findest
eat
this
roll
and
go
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
3
2
so
i
opened
my
mouth
and
he
caused
me
to
eat
that
roll
3
3
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
cause
thy
belly
to
eat
and
fill
thy
bowels
with
this
roll
that
i
give
thee
then
did
i
eat
it
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
as
honey
for
sweetness
3
4
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
go
get
thee
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
speak
with
my
words
unto
them
3
5
for
thou
art
not
sent
to
a
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language
but
to
the
house
of
israel
3
6
not
to
many
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language
whose
words
thou
canst
not
understand
surely
had
i
sent
thee
to
them
they
would
have
hearkened
unto
thee
3
7
but
the
house
of
israel
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
for
they
will
not
hearken
unto
me
for
all
the
house
of
israel
are
impudent
and
hardhearted
3
8
behold
i
have
made
thy
face
strong
against
their
faces
and
thy
forehead
strong
against
their
foreheads
3
9
as
an
adamant
harder
than
flint
have
i
made
thy
forehead
fear
them
not
neither
be
dismayed
at
their
looks
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
3
10
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
all
my
words
that
i
shall
speak
unto
thee
receive
in
thine
heart
and
hear
with
thine
ears
3
11
and
go
get
thee
to
them
of
the
captivity
unto
the
children
of
thy
people
and
speak
unto
them
and
tell
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
3
12
then
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
i
heard
behind
me
a
voice
of
a
great
rushing
saying
blessed
be
the
glory
of
the
lord
from
his
place
3
13
i
heard
also
the
noise
of
the
wings
of
the
living
creatures
that
touched
one
another
and
the
noise
of
the
wheels
over
against
them
and
a
noise
of
a
great
rushing
3
14
so
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
and
took
me
away
and
i
went
in
bitterness
in
the
heat
of
my
spirit
but
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
strong
upon
me
3
15
then
i
came
to
them
of
the
captivity
at
telabib
that
dwelt
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
sat
where
they
sat
and
remained
there
astonished
among
them
seven
days
3
16
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
seven
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
3
17
son
of
man
i
have
made
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
israel
therefore
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth
and
give
them
warning
from
me
3
18
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
givest
him
not
warning
nor
speakest
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
wicked
way
to
save
his
life
the
same
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
3
19
yet
if
thou
warn
the
wicked
and
he
turn
not
from
his
wickedness
nor
from
his
wicked
way
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
3
20
again
when
a
righteous
man
doth
turn
from
his
righteousness
and
commit
iniquity
and
i
lay
a
stumbling-block
before
him
he
shall
die
because
thou
hast
not
given
him
warning
he
shall
die
in
his
sin
and
his
righteousness
which
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
remembered
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
3
21
nevertheless
if
thou
warn
the
righteous
man
that
the
righteous
sin
not
and
he
doth
not
sin
he
shall
surely
live
because
he
is
warned
also
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
3
22
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
there
upon
me
and
he
said
unto
me
arise
go
forth
into
the
plain
and
i
will
there
talk
with
thee
3
23
then
i
arose
and
went
forth
into
the
plain
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
stood
there
as
the
glory
which
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
fell
on
my
face
3
24
then
the
spirit
entered
into
me
and
set
me
upon
my
feet
and
spake
with
me
and
said
unto
me
go
shut
thyself
within
thine
house
3
25
but
thou
o
son
of
man
behold
they
shall
put
bands
upon
thee
and
shall
bind
thee
with
them
and
thou
shalt
not
go
out
among
them
3
26
and
i
will
make
thy
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
thy
mouth
that
thou
shalt
be
dumb
and
shalt
not
be
to
them
a
reprover
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
3
27
but
when
i
speak
with
thee
i
will
open
thy
mouth
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
he
that
heareth
let
him
hear
and
he
that
forbeareth
let
him
forbear
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
4
1
thou
also
son
of
man
take
thee
a
tile
and
lay
it
before
thee
and
pourtray
upon
it
the
city
even
jerusalem
4
2
and
lay
siege
against
it
and
build
a
fort
against
it
and
cast
a
mount
against
it
set
the
camp
also
against
it
and
set
battering
rams
against
it
round
about
4
3
moreover
take
thou
unto
thee
an
iron
pan
and
set
it
for
a
wall
of
iron
between
thee
and
the
city
and
set
thy
face
against
it
and
it
shall
be
besieged
and
thou
shalt
lay
siege
against
it
this
shall
be
a
sign
to
the
house
of
israel
4
4
lie
thou
also
upon
thy
left
side
and
lay
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
upon
it
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
it
thou
shalt
bear
their
iniquity
4
5
for
i
have
laid
upon
thee
the
years
of
their
iniquity
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
three
hundred
and
ninety
days
so
shalt
thou
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
4
6
and
when
thou
hast
accomplished
them
lie
again
on
thy
right
side
and
thou
shalt
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
judah
forty
days
i
have
appointed
thee
each
day
for
a
year
4
7
therefore
thou
shalt
set
thy
face
toward
the
siege
of
jerusalem
and
thine
arm
shall
be
uncovered
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
against
it
4
8
and
behold
i
will
lay
bands
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
turn
thee
from
one
side
to
another
till
thou
hast
ended
the
days
of
thy
siege
4
9
take
thou
also
unto
thee
wheat
and
barley
and
beans
and
lentiles
and
millet
and
fitches
and
put
them
in
one
vessel
and
make
thee
bread
thereof
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
thy
side
three
hundred
and
ninety
days
shalt
thou
eat
thereof
4
10
and
thy
meat
which
thou
shalt
eat
shall
be
by
weight
twenty
shekels
a
day
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
eat
it
4
11
thou
shalt
drink
also
water
by
measure
the
sixth
part
of
an
hin
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
drink
4
12
and
thou
shalt
eat
it
as
barley
cakes
and
thou
shalt
bake
it
with
dung
that
cometh
out
of
man
in
their
sight
4
13
and
the
lord
said
even
thus
shall
the
children
of
israel
eat
their
defiled
bread
among
the
gentiles
whither
i
will
drive
them
4
14
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
my
soul
hath
not
been
polluted
for
from
my
youth
up
even
till
now
have
i
not
eaten
of
that
which
dieth
of
itself
or
is
torn
in
pieces
neither
came
there
abominable
flesh
into
my
mouth
4
15
then
he
said
unto
me
lo
i
have
given
thee
cow’s
dung
for
man’s
dung
and
thou
shalt
prepare
thy
bread
therewith
4
16
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
behold
i
will
break
the
staff
of
bread
in
jerusalem
and
they
shall
eat
bread
by
weight
and
with
care
and
they
shall
drink
water
by
measure
and
with
astonishment
4
17
that
they
may
want
bread
and
water
and
be
astonied
one
with
another
and
consume
away
for
their
iniquity
5
1
and
thou
son
of
man
take
thee
a
sharp
knife
take
thee
a
barber’s
razor
and
cause
it
to
pass
upon
thine
head
and
upon
thy
beard
then
take
thee
balances
to
weigh
and
divide
the
hair
5
2
thou
shalt
burn
with
fire
a
third
part
in
the
midst
of
the
city
when
the
days
of
the
siege
are
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
take
a
third
part
and
smite
about
it
with
a
knife
and
a
third
part
thou
shalt
scatter
in
the
wind
and
i
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them
5
3
thou
shalt
also
take
thereof
a
few
in
number
and
bind
them
in
thy
skirts
5
4
then
take
of
them
again
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
burn
them
in
the
fire
for
thereof
shall
a
fire
come
forth
into
all
the
house
of
israel
5
5
thus
saith
the
lord
god
this
is
jerusalem
i
have
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
nations
and
countries
that
are
round
about
her
5
6
and
she
hath
changed
my
judgments
into
wickedness
more
than
the
nations
and
my
statutes
more
than
the
countries
that
are
round
about
her
for
they
have
refused
my
judgments
and
my
statutes
they
have
not
walked
in
them
5
7
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
multiplied
more
than
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you
and
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes
neither
have
kept
my
judgments
neither
have
done
according
to
the
judgments
of
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you
5
8
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
even
i
am
against
thee
and
will
execute
judgments
in
the
midst
of
thee
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
5
9
and
i
will
do
in
thee
that
which
i
have
not
done
and
whereunto
i
will
not
do
any
more
the
like
because
of
all
thine
abominations
5
10
therefore
the
fathers
shall
eat
the
sons
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
the
sons
shall
eat
their
fathers
and
i
will
execute
judgments
in
thee
and
the
whole
remnant
of
thee
will
i
scatter
into
all
the
winds
5
11
wherefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
because
thou
hast
defiled
my
sanctuary
with
all
thy
detestable
things
and
with
all
thine
abominations
therefore
will
i
also
diminish
thee
neither
shall
mine
eye
spare
neither
will
i
have
any
pity
5
12
a
third
part
of
thee
shall
die
with
the
pestilence
and
with
famine
shall
they
be
consumed
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
a
third
part
shall
fall
by
the
sword
round
about
thee
and
i
will
scatter
a
third
part
into
all
the
winds
and
i
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them
5
13
thus
shall
mine
anger
be
accomplished
and
i
will
cause
my
fury
to
rest
upon
them
and
i
will
be
comforted
and
they
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
in
my
zeal
when
i
have
accomplished
my
fury
in
them
5
14
moreover
i
will
make
thee
waste
and
a
reproach
among
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee
in
the
sight
of
all
that
pass
by
5
15
so
it
shall
be
a
reproach
and
a
taunt
an
instruction
and
an
astonishment
unto
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee
when
i
shall
execute
judgments
in
thee
in
anger
and
in
fury
and
in
furious
rebukes
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it

when
i
shall
send
upon
them
the
evil
arrows
of
famine
which
shall
be
for
their
destruction
and
which
i
will
send
to
destroy
you
and
i
will
increase
the
famine
upon
you
and
will
break
your
staff
of
bread
5
17
so
will
i
send
upon
you
famine
and
evil
beasts
and
they
shall
bereave
thee
and
pestilence
and
blood
shall
pass
through
thee
and
i
will
bring
the
sword
upon
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
6
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
6
2
son
of
man
set
thy
face
toward
the
mountains
of
israel
and
prophesy
against
them
6
3
and
say
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
valleys
behold
i
even
i
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you
and
i
will
destroy
your
high
places
6
4
and
your
altars
shall
be
desolate
and
your
images
shall
be
broken
and
i
will
cast
down
your
slain
men
before
your
idols
6
5
and
i
will
lay
the
dead
carcases
of
the
children
of
israel
before
their
idols
and
i
will
scatter
your
bones
round
about
your
altars
6
6
in
all
your
dwellingplaces
the
cities
shall
be
laid
waste
and
the
high
places
shall
be
desolate
that
your
altars
may
be
laid
waste
and
made
desolate
and
your
idols
may
be
broken
and
cease
and
your
images
may
be
cut
down
and
your
works
may
be
abolished
6
7
and
the
slain
shall
fall
in
the
midst
of
you
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
6
8
yet
will
i
leave
a
remnant
that
ye
may
have
some
that
shall
escape
the
sword
among
the
nations
when
ye
shall
be
scattered
through
the
countries
6
9
and
they
that
escape
of
you
shall
remember
me
among
the
nations
whither
they
shall
be
carried
captives
because
i
am
broken
with
their
whorish
heart
which
hath
departed
from
me
and
with
their
eyes
which
go
a
whoring
after
their
idols
and
they
shall
lothe
themselves
for
the
evils
which
they
have
committed
in
all
their
abominations
6
10
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
that
i
have
not
said
in
vain
that
i
would
do
this
evil
unto
them
6
11
thus
saith
the
lord
god
smite
with
thine
hand
and
stamp
with
thy
foot
and
say
alas
for
all
the
evil
abominations
of
the
house
of
israel
for
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
6
12
he
that
is
far
off
shall
die
of
the
pestilence
and
he
that
is
near
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
he
that
remaineth
and
is
besieged
shall
die
by
the
famine
thus
will
i
accomplish
my
fury
upon
them
6
13
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
their
slain
men
shall
be
among
their
idols
round
about
their
altars
upon
every
high
hill
in
all
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
under
every
green
tree
and
under
every
thick
oak
the
place
where
they
did
offer
sweet
savour
to
all
their
idols
6
14
so
will
i
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
them
and
make
the
land
desolate
yea
more
desolate
than
the
wilderness
toward
diblath
in
all
their
habitations
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
7
1
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
7
2
also
thou
son
of
man
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
the
land
of
israel
an
end
the
end
is
come
upon
the
four
corners
of
the
land
7
3
now
is
the
end
come
upon
thee
and
i
will
send
mine
anger
upon
thee
and
will
judge
thee
according
to
thy
ways
and
will
recompense
upon
thee
all
thine
abominations
7
4
and
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
thee
neither
will
i
have
pity
but
i
will
recompense
thy
ways
upon
thee
and
thine
abominations
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
7
5
thus
saith
the
lord
god
an
evil
an
only
evil
behold
is
come
7
6
an
end
is
come
the
end
is
come
it
watcheth
for
thee
behold
it
is
come
7
7
the
morning
is
come
unto
thee
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
land
the
time
is
come
the
day
of
trouble
is
near
and
not
the
sounding
again
of
the
mountains
7
8
now
will
i
shortly
pour
out
my
fury
upon
thee
and
accomplish
mine
anger
upon
thee
and
i
will
judge
thee
according
to
thy
ways
and
will
recompense
thee
for
all
thine
abominations
7
9
and
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
i
will
recompense
thee
according
to
thy
ways
and
thine
abominations
that
are
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
smiteth
7
10
behold
the
day
behold
it
is
come
the
morning
is
gone
forth
the
rod
hath
blossomed
pride
hath
budded
7
11
violence
is
risen
up
into
a
rod
of
wickedness
none
of
them
shall
remain
nor
of
their
multitude
nor
of
any
of
theirs
neither
shall
there
be
wailing
for
them
7
12
the
time
is
come
the
day
draweth
near
let
not
the
buyer
rejoice
nor
the
seller
mourn
for
wrath
is
upon
all
the
multitude
thereof
7
13
for
the
seller
shall
not
return
to
that
which
is
sold
although
they
were
yet
alive
for
the
vision
is
touching
the
whole
multitude
thereof
which
shall
not
return
neither
shall
any
strengthen
himself
in
the
iniquity
of
his
life
7
14
they
have
blown
the
trumpet
even
to
make
all
ready
but
none
goeth
to
the
battle
for
my
wrath
is
upon
all
the
multitude
thereof
7
15
the
sword
is
without
and
the
pestilence
and
the
famine
within
he
that
is
in
the
field
shall
die
with
the
sword
and
he
that
is
in
the
city
famine
and
pestilence
shall
devour
him
7
16
but
they
that
escape
of
them
shall
escape
and
shall
be
on
the
mountains
like
doves
of
the
valleys
all
of
them
mourning
every
one
for
his
iniquity
7
17
all
hands
shall
be
feeble
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as
water
7
18
they
shall
also
gird
themselves
with
sackcloth
and
horror
shall
cover
them
and
shame
shall
be
upon
all
faces
and
baldness
upon
all
their
heads
7
19
they
shall
cast
their
silver
in
the
streets
and
their
gold
shall
be
removed
their
silver
and
their
gold
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
them
in
the
day
of
the
wrath
of
the
lord
they
shall
not
satisfy
their
souls
neither
fill
their
bowels
because
it
is
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity
7
20
as
for
the
beauty
of
his
ornament
he
set
it
in
majesty
but
they
made
the
images
of
their
abominations
and
of
their
detestable
things
therein
therefore
have
i
set
it
far
from
them
7
21
and
i
will
give
it
into
the
hands
of
the
strangers
for
a
prey
and
to
the
wicked
of
the
earth
for
a
spoil
and
they
shall
pollute
it
7
22
my
face
will
i
turn
also
from
them
and
they
shall
pollute
my
secret
place
for
the
robbers
shall
enter
into
it
and
defile
it
7
23
make
a
chain
for
the
land
is
full
of
bloody
crimes
and
the
city
is
full
of
violence
7
24
wherefore
i
will
bring
the
worst
of
the
heathen
and
they
shall
possess
their
houses
i
will
also
make
the
pomp
of
the
strong
to
cease
and
their
holy
places
shall
be
defiled
7
25
destruction
cometh
and
they
shall
seek
peace
and
there
shall
be
none
7
26
mischief
shall
come
upon
mischief
and
rumour
shall
be
upon
rumour
then
shall
they
seek
a
vision
of
the
prophet
but
the
law
shall
perish
from
the
priest
and
counsel
from
the
ancients
7
27
the
king
shall
mourn
and
the
prince
shall
be
clothed
with
desolation
and
the
hands
of
the
people
of
the
land
shall
be
troubled
i
will
do
unto
them
after
their
way
and
according
to
their
deserts
will
i
judge
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
8
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year
in
the
sixth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
as
i
sat
in
mine
house
and
the
elders
of
judah
sat
before
me
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
god
fell
there
upon
me
8
2
then
i
beheld
and
lo
a
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
fire
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward
fire
and
from
his
loins
even
upward
as
the
appearance
of
brightness
as
the
colour
of
amber
8
3
and
he
put
forth
the
form
of
an
hand
and
took
me
by
a
lock
of
mine
head
and
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven
and
brought
me
in
the
visions
of
god
to
jerusalem
to
the
door
of
the
inner
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
north
where
was
the
seat
of
the
image
of
jealousy
which
provoketh
to
jealousy
8
4
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
there
according
to
the
vision
that
i
saw
in
the
plain
8
5
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
lift
up
thine
eyes
now
the
way
toward
the
north
so
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
the
way
toward
the
north
and
behold
northward
at
the
gate
of
the
altar
this
image
of
jealousy
in
the
entry
8
6
he
said
furthermore
unto
me
son
of
man
seest
thou
what
they
do
even
the
great
abominations
that
the
house
of
israel
committeth
here
that
i
should
go
far
off
from
my
sanctuary
but
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
8
7
and
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
court
and
when
i
looked
behold
a
hole
in
the
wall
8
8
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
dig
now
in
the
wall
and
when
i
had
digged
in
the
wall
behold
a
door
8
9
and
he
said
unto
me
go
in
and
behold
the
wicked
abominations
that
they
do
here
8
10
so
i
went
in
and
saw
and
behold
every
form
of
creeping
things
and
abominable
beasts
and
all
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall
round
about
8
11
and
there
stood
before
them
seventy
men
of
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
jaazaniah
the
son
of
shaphan
with
every
man
his
censer
in
his
hand
and
a
thick
cloud
of
incense
went
up
8
12
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
hast
thou
seen
what
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
do
in
the
dark
every
man
in
the
chambers
of
his
imagery
for
they
say
the
lord
seeth
us
not
the
lord
hath
forsaken
the
earth
8
13
he
said
also
unto
me
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
that
they
do
8
14
then
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
which
was
toward
the
north
and
behold
there
sat
women
weeping
for
tammuz
8
15
then
said
he
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
than
these
8
16
and
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
of
the
lord’s
house
and
behold
at
the
door
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
were
about
five
and
twenty
men
with
their
backs
toward
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
their
faces
toward
the
east
and
they
worshipped
the
sun
toward
the
east
8
17
then
he
said
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
is
it
a
light
thing
to
the
house
of
judah
that
they
commit
the
abominations
which
they
commit
here
for
they
have
filled
the
land
with
violence
and
have
returned
to
provoke
me
to
anger
and
lo
they
put
the
branch
to
their
nose
8
18
therefore
will
i
also
deal
in
fury
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
and
though
they
cry
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice
yet
will
i
not
hear
them
9
1
he
cried
also
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice
saying
cause
them
that
have
charge
over
the
city
to
draw
near
even
every
man
with
his
destroying
weapon
in
his
hand
9
2
and
behold
six
men
came
from
the
way
of
the
higher
gate
which
lieth
toward
the
north
and
every
man
a
slaughter
weapon
in
his
hand
and
one
man
among
them
was
clothed
with
linen
with
a
writer’s
inkhorn
by
his
side
and
they
went
in
and
stood
beside
the
brasen
altar
9
3
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
gone
up
from
the
cherub
whereupon
he
was
to
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
he
called
to
the
man
clothed
with
linen
which
had
the
writer’s
inkhorn
by
his
side
9
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
through
the
midst
of
the
city
through
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
set
a
mark
upon
the
foreheads
of
the
men
that
sigh
and
that
cry
for
all
the
abominations
that
be
done
in
the
midst
thereof
9
5
and
to
the
others
he
said
in
mine
hearing
go
ye
after
him
through
the
city
and
smite
let
not
your
eye
spare
neither
have
ye
pity
9
6
slay
utterly
old
and
young
both
maids
and
little
children
and
women
but
come
not
near
any
man
upon
whom
is
the
mark
and
begin
at
my
sanctuary
then
they
began
at
the
ancient
men
which
were
before
the
house
9
7
and
he
said
unto
them
defile
the
house
and
fill
the
courts
with
the
slain
go
ye
forth
and
they
went
forth
and
slew
in
the
city
9
8
and
it
came
to
pass
while
they
were
slaying
them
and
i
was
left
that
i
fell
upon
my
face
and
cried
and
said
ah
lord
god
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
residue
of
israel
in
thy
pouring
out
of
thy
fury
upon
jerusalem
9
9
then
said
he
unto
me
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
and
judah
is
exceeding
great
and
the
land
is
full
of
blood
and
the
city
full
of
perverseness
for
they
say
the
lord
hath
forsaken
the
earth
and
the
lord
seeth
not
9
10
and
as
for
me
also
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
but
i
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
head
9
11
and
behold
the
man
clothed
with
linen
which
had
the
inkhorn
by
his
side
reported
the
matter
saying
i
have
done
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
10
1
then
i
looked
and
behold
in
the
firmament
that
was
above
the
head
of
the
cherubims
there
appeared
over
them
as
it
were
a
sapphire
stone
as
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
a
throne
10
2
and
he
spake
unto
the
man
clothed
with
linen
and
said
go
in
between
the
wheels
even
under
the
cherub
and
fill
thine
hand
with
coals
of
fire
from
between
the
cherubims
and
scatter
them
over
the
city
and
he
went
in
in
my
sight
10
3
now
the
cherubims
stood
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
when
the
man
went
in
and
the
cloud
filled
the
inner
court
10
4
then
the
glory
of
the
lord
went
up
from
the
cherub
and
stood
over
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
cloud
and
the
court
was
full
of
the
brightness
of
the
lord’s
glory
10
5
and
the
sound
of
the
cherubims’
wings
was
heard
even
to
the
outer
court
as
the
voice
of
the
almighty
god
when
he
speaketh
10
6
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
commanded
the
man
clothed
with
linen
saying
take
fire
from
between
the
wheels
from
between
the
cherubims
then
he
went
in
and
stood
beside
the
wheels
10
7
and
one
cherub
stretched
forth
his
hand
from
between
the
cherubims
unto
the
fire
that
was
between
the
cherubims
and
took
thereof
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
him
that
was
clothed
with
linen
who
took
it
and
went
out
10
8
and
there
appeared
in
the
cherubims
the
form
of
a
man’s
hand
under
their
wings
10
9
and
when
i
looked
behold
the
four
wheels
by
the
cherubims
one
wheel
by
one
cherub
and
another
wheel
by
another
cherub
and
the
appearance
of
the
wheels
was
as
the
colour
of
a
beryl
stone
10
10
and
as
for
their
appearances
they
four
had
one
likeness
as
if
a
wheel
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
wheel
10
11
when
they
went
they
went
upon
their
four
sides
they
turned
not
as
they
went
but
to
the
place
whither
the
head
looked
they
followed
it
they
turned
not
as
they
went
10
12
and
their
whole
body
and
their
backs
and
their
hands
and
their
wings
and
the
wheels
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
even
the
wheels
that
they
four
had
10
13
as
for
the
wheels
it
was
cried
unto
them
in
my
hearing
o
wheel
10
14
and
every
one
had
four
faces
the
first
face
was
the
face
of
a
cherub
and
the
second
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
and
the
third
the
face
of
a
lion
and
the
fourth
the
face
of
an
eagle
10
15
and
the
cherubims
were
lifted
up
this
is
the
living
creature
that
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
10
16
and
when
the
cherubims
went
the
wheels
went
by
them
and
when
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings
to
mount
up
from
the
earth
the
same
wheels
also
turned
not
from
beside
them
10
17
when
they
stood
these
stood
and
when
they
were
lifted
up
these
lifted
up
themselves
also
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
them
10
18
then
the
glory
of
the
lord
departed
from
off
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
stood
over
the
cherubims
10
19
and
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings
and
mounted
up
from
the
earth
in
my
sight
when
they
went
out
the
wheels
also
were
beside
them
and
every
one
stood
at
the
door
of
the
east
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
over
them
above
10
20
this
is
the
living
creature
that
i
saw
under
the
god
of
israel
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
knew
that
they
were
the
cherubims
10
21
every
one
had
four
faces
apiece
and
every
one
four
wings
and
the
likeness
of
the
hands
of
a
man
was
under
their
wings
10
22
and
the
likeness
of
their
faces
was
the
same
faces
which
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
their
appearances
and
themselves
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
11
1
moreover
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
and
brought
me
unto
the
east
gate
of
the
lord’s
house
which
looketh
eastward
and
behold
at
the
door
of
the
gate
five
and
twenty
men
among
whom
i
saw
jaazaniah
the
son
of
azur
and
pelatiah
the
son
of
benaiah
princes
of
the
people
11
2
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
these
are
the
men
that
devise
mischief
and
give
wicked
counsel
in
this
city
11
3
which
say
it
is
not
near
let
us
build
houses
this
city
is
the
caldron
and
we
be
the
flesh
11
4
therefore
prophesy
against
them
prophesy
o
son
of
man
11
5
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
fell
upon
me
and
said
unto
me
speak
thus
saith
the
lord
thus
have
ye
said
o
house
of
israel
for
i
know
the
things
that
come
into
your
mind
every
one
of
them
11
6
ye
have
multiplied
your
slain
in
this
city
and
ye
have
filled
the
streets
thereof
with
the
slain
11
7
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
your
slain
whom
ye
have
laid
in
the
midst
of
it
they
are
the
flesh
and
this
city
is
the
caldron
but
i
will
bring
you
forth
out
of
the
midst
of
it
11
8
ye
have
feared
the
sword
and
i
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you
saith
the
lord
god
11
9
and
i
will
bring
you
out
of
the
midst
thereof
and
deliver
you
into
the
hands
of
strangers
and
will
execute
judgments
among
you
11
10
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword
i
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
11
11
this
city
shall
not
be
your
caldron
neither
shall
ye
be
the
flesh
in
the
midst
thereof
but
i
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
israel
11
12
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
ye
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes
neither
executed
my
judgments
but
have
done
after
the
manners
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you
11
13
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
prophesied
that
pelatiah
the
son
of
benaiah
died
then
fell
i
down
upon
my
face
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
ah
lord
god
wilt
thou
make
a
full
end
of
the
remnant
of
israel
11
14
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
11
15
son
of
man
thy
brethren
even
thy
brethren
the
men
of
thy
kindred
and
all
the
house
of
israel
wholly
are
they
unto
whom
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
have
said
get
you
far
from
the
lord
unto
us
is
this
land
given
in
possession
11
16
therefore
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
although
i
have
cast
them
far
off
among
the
heathen
and
although
i
have
scattered
them
among
the
countries
yet
will
i
be
to
them
as
a
little
sanctuary
in
the
countries
where
they
shall
come
11
17
therefore
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
gather
you
from
the
people
and
assemble
you
out
of
the
countries
where
ye
have
been
scattered
and
i
will
give
you
the
land
of
israel
11
18
and
they
shall
come
thither
and
they
shall
take
away
all
the
detestable
things
thereof
and
all
the
abominations
thereof
from
thence
11
19
and
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
i
will
put
a
new
spirit
within
you
and
i
will
take
the
stony
heart
out
of
their
flesh
and
will
give
them
an
heart
of
flesh
11
20
that
they
may
walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
mine
ordinances
and
do
them
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
11
21
but
as
for
them
whose
heart
walketh
after
the
heart
of
their
detestable
things
and
their
abominations
i
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
own
heads
saith
the
lord
god
11
22
then
did
the
cherubims
lift
up
their
wings
and
the
wheels
beside
them
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
over
them
above
11
23
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
went
up
from
the
midst
of
the
city
and
stood
upon
the
mountain
which
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
11
24
afterwards
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
brought
me
in
a
vision
by
the
spirit
of
god
into
chaldea
to
them
of
the
captivity
so
the
vision
that
i
had
seen
went
up
from
me
11
25
then
i
spake
unto
them
of
the
captivity
all
the
things
that
the
lord
had
shewed
me
12
1
the
word
of
the
lord
also
came
unto
me
saying
12
2
son
of
man
thou
dwellest
in
the
midst
of
a
rebellious
house
which
have
eyes
to
see
and
see
not
they
have
ears
to
hear
and
hear
not
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
12
3
therefore
thou
son
of
man
prepare
thee
stuff
for
removing
and
remove
by
day
in
their
sight
and
thou
shalt
remove
from
thy
place
to
another
place
in
their
sight
it
may
be
they
will
consider
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
12
4
then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
thy
stuff
by
day
in
their
sight
as
stuff
for
removing
and
thou
shalt
go
forth
at
even
in
their
sight
as
they
that
go
forth
into
captivity
12
5
dig
thou
through
the
wall
in
their
sight
and
carry
out
thereby
12
6
in
their
sight
shalt
thou
bear
it
upon
thy
shoulders
and
carry
it
forth
in
the
twilight
thou
shalt
cover
thy
face
that
thou
see
not
the
ground
for
i
have
set
thee
for
a
sign
unto
the
house
of
israel
12
7
and
i
did
so
as
i
was
commanded
i
brought
forth
my
stuff
by
day
as
stuff
for
captivity
and
in
the
even
i
digged
through
the
wall
with
mine
hand
i
brought
it
forth
in
the
twilight
and
i
bare
it
upon
my
shoulder
in
their
sight
12
8
and
in
the
morning
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
me
saying
12
9
son
of
man
hath
not
the
house
of
israel
the
rebellious
house
said
unto
thee
what
doest
thou
12
10
say
thou
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
this
burden
concerneth
the
prince
in
jerusalem
and
all
the
house
of
israel
that
are
among
them
12
11
say
i
am
your
sign
like
as
i
have
done
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
them
they
shall
remove
and
go
into
captivity
12
12
and
the
prince
that
is
among
them
shall
bear
upon
his
shoulder
in
the
twilight
and
shall
go
forth
they
shall
dig
through
the
wall
to
carry
out
thereby
he
shall
cover
his
face
that
he
see
not
the
ground
with
his
eyes
12
13
my
net
also
will
i
spread
upon
him
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare
and
i
will
bring
him
to
babylon
to
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
yet
shall
he
not
see
it
though
he
shall
die
there
12
14
and
i
will
scatter
toward
every
wind
all
that
are
about
him
to
help
him
and
all
his
bands
and
i
will
draw
out
the
sword
after
them
12
15
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
scatter
them
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
in
the
countries
12
16
but
i
will
leave
a
few
men
of
them
from
the
sword
from
the
famine
and
from
the
pestilence
that
they
may
declare
all
their
abominations
among
the
heathen
whither
they
come
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
12
17
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
12
18
son
of
man
eat
thy
bread
with
quaking
and
drink
thy
water
with
trembling
and
with
carefulness
12
19
and
say
unto
the
people
of
the
land
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
of
the
land
of
israel
they
shall
eat
their
bread
with
carefulness
and
drink
their
water
with
astonishment
that
her
land
may
be
desolate
from
all
that
is
therein
because
of
the
violence
of
all
them
that
dwell
therein
12
20
and
the
cities
that
are
inhabited
shall
be
laid
waste
and
the
land
shall
be
desolate
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
12
21
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
12
22
son
of
man
what
is
that
proverb
that
ye
have
in
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
days
are
prolonged
and
every
vision
faileth
12
23
tell
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
make
this
proverb
to
cease
and
they
shall
no
more
use
it
as
a
proverb
in
israel
but
say
unto
them
the
days
are
at
hand
and
the
effect
of
every
vision
12
24
for
there
shall
be
no
more
any
vain
vision
nor
flattering
divination
within
the
house
of
israel
12
25
for
i
am
the
lord
i
will
speak
and
the
word
that
i
shall
speak
shall
come
to
pass
it
shall
be
no
more
prolonged
for
in
your
days
o
rebellious
house
will
i
say
the
word
and
will
perform
it
saith
the
lord
god
12
26
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
12
27
son
of
man
behold
they
of
the
house
of
israel
say
the
vision
that
he
seeth
is
for
many
days
to
come
and
he
prophesieth
of
the
times
that
are
far
off
12
28
therefore
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
none
of
my
words
be
prolonged
any
more
but
the
word
which
i
have
spoken
shall
be
done
saith
the
lord
god
13
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
13
2
son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
prophets
of
israel
that
prophesy
and
say
thou
unto
them
that
prophesy
out
of
their
own
hearts
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
13
3
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
unto
the
foolish
prophets
that
follow
their
own
spirit
and
have
seen
nothing
13
4
o
israel
thy
prophets
are
like
the
foxes
in
the
deserts
13
5
ye
have
not
gone
up
into
the
gaps
neither
made
up
the
hedge
for
the
house
of
israel
to
stand
in
the
battle
in
the
day
of
the
lord
13
6
they
have
seen
vanity
and
lying
divination
saying
the
lord
saith
and
the
lord
hath
not
sent
them
and
they
have
made
others
to
hope
that
they
would
confirm
the
word
13
7
have
ye
not
seen
a
vain
vision
and
have
ye
not
spoken
a
lying
divination
whereas
ye
say
the
lord
saith
it
albeit
i
have
not
spoken
13
8
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
have
spoken
vanity
and
seen
lies
therefore
behold
i
am
against
you
saith
the
lord
god
13
9
and
mine
hand
shall
be
upon
the
prophets
that
see
vanity
and
that
divine
lies
they
shall
not
be
in
the
assembly
of
my
people
neither
shall
they
be
written
in
the
writing
of
the
house
of
israel
neither
shall
they
enter
into
the
land
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
13
10
because
even
because
they
have
seduced
my
people
saying
peace
and
there
was
no
peace
and
one
built
up
a
wall
and
lo
others
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter
13
11
say
unto
them
which
daub
it
with
untempered
morter
that
it
shall
fall
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower
and
ye
o
great
hailstones
shall
fall
and
a
stormy
wind
shall
rend
it
13
12
lo
when
the
wall
is
fallen
shall
it
not
be
said
unto
you
where
is
the
daubing
wherewith
ye
have
daubed
it
13
13
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
rend
it
with
a
stormy
wind
in
my
fury
and
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower
in
mine
anger
and
great
hailstones
in
my
fury
to
consume
it
13
14
so
will
i
break
down
the
wall
that
ye
have
daubed
with
untempered
morter
and
bring
it
down
to
the
ground
so
that
the
foundation
thereof
shall
be
discovered
and
it
shall
fall
and
ye
shall
be
consumed
in
the
midst
thereof
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
13
15
thus
will
i
accomplish
my
wrath
upon
the
wall
and
upon
them
that
have
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter
and
will
say
unto
you
the
wall
is
no
more
neither
they
that
daubed
it
13
16
to
wit
the
prophets
of
israel
which
prophesy
concerning
jerusalem
and
which
see
visions
of
peace
for
her
and
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
god
13
17
likewise
thou
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
the
daughters
of
thy
people
which
prophesy
out
of
their
own
heart
and
prophesy
thou
against
them
13
18
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
women
that
sew
pillows
to
all
armholes
and
make
kerchiefs
upon
the
head
of
every
stature
to
hunt
souls
will
ye
hunt
the
souls
of
my
people
and
will
ye
save
the
souls
alive
that
come
unto
you
13
19
and
will
ye
pollute
me
among
my
people
for
handfuls
of
barley
and
for
pieces
of
bread
to
slay
the
souls
that
should
not
die
and
to
save
the
souls
alive
that
should
not
live
by
your
lying
to
my
people
that
hear
your
lies
13
20
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
your
pillows
wherewith
ye
there
hunt
the
souls
to
make
them
fly
and
i
will
tear
them
from
your
arms
and
will
let
the
souls
go
even
the
souls
that
ye
hunt
to
make
them
fly
13
21
your
kerchiefs
also
will
i
tear
and
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand
and
they
shall
be
no
more
in
your
hand
to
be
hunted
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
13
22
because
with
lies
ye
have
made
the
heart
of
the
righteous
sad
whom
i
have
not
made
sad
and
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
wicked
that
he
should
not
return
from
his
wicked
way
by
promising
him
life
13
23
therefore
ye
shall
see
no
more
vanity
nor
divine
divinations
for
i
will
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
14
1
then
came
certain
of
the
elders
of
israel
unto
me
and
sat
before
me
14
2
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
14
3
son
of
man
these
men
have
set
up
their
idols
in
their
heart
and
put
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity
before
their
face
should
i
be
enquired
of
at
all
by
them
14
4
therefore
speak
unto
them
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
every
man
of
the
house
of
israel
that
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
to
the
prophet
i
the
lord
will
answer
him
that
cometh
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
idols
14
5
that
i
may
take
the
house
of
israel
in
their
own
heart
because
they
are
all
estranged
from
me
through
their
idols
14
6
therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
repent
and
turn
yourselves
from
your
idols
and
turn
away
your
faces
from
all
your
abominations
14
7
for
every
one
of
the
house
of
israel
or
of
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
in
israel
which
separateth
himself
from
me
and
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
to
a
prophet
to
enquire
of
him
concerning
me
i
the
lord
will
answer
him
by
myself
14
8
and
i
will
set
my
face
against
that
man
and
will
make
him
a
sign
and
a
proverb
and
i
will
cut
him
off
from
the
midst
of
my
people
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
14
9
and
if
the
prophet
be
deceived
when
he
hath
spoken
a
thing
i
the
lord
have
deceived
that
prophet
and
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
him
and
will
destroy
him
from
the
midst
of
my
people
israel
14
10
and
they
shall
bear
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity
the
punishment
of
the
prophet
shall
be
even
as
the
punishment
of
him
that
seeketh
unto
him
14
11
that
the
house
of
israel
may
go
no
more
astray
from
me
neither
be
polluted
any
more
with
all
their
transgressions
but
that
they
may
be
my
people
and
i
may
be
their
god
saith
the
lord
god
14
12
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
to
me
saying
14
13
son
of
man
when
the
land
sinneth
against
me
by
trespassing
grievously
then
will
i
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
it
and
will
break
the
staff
of
the
bread
thereof
and
will
send
famine
upon
it
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
14
14
though
these
three
men
noah
daniel
and
job
were
in
it
they
should
deliver
but
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness
saith
the
lord
god
14
15
if
i
cause
noisome
beasts
to
pass
through
the
land
and
they
spoil
it
so
that
it
be
desolate
that
no
man
may
pass
through
because
of
the
beasts
14
16
though
these
three
men
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters
they
only
shall
be
delivered
but
the
land
shall
be
desolate
14
17
or
if
i
bring
a
sword
upon
that
land
and
say
sword
go
through
the
land
so
that
i
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
14
18
though
these
three
men
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters
but
they
only
shall
be
delivered
themselves
14
19
or
if
i
send
a
pestilence
into
that
land
and
pour
out
my
fury
upon
it
in
blood
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast
14
20
though
noah
daniel
and
job
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
son
nor
daughter
they
shall
but
deliver
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness
14
21
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
how
much
more
when
i
send
my
four
sore
judgments
upon
jerusalem
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
noisome
beast
and
the
pestilence
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast
14
22
yet
behold
therein
shall
be
left
a
remnant
that
shall
be
brought
forth
both
sons
and
daughters
behold
they
shall
come
forth
unto
you
and
ye
shall
see
their
way
and
their
doings
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
concerning
the
evil
that
i
have
brought
upon
jerusalem
even
concerning
all
that
i
have
brought
upon
it
14
23
and
they
shall
comfort
you
when
ye
see
their
ways
and
their
doings
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
have
not
done
without
cause
all
that
i
have
done
in
it
saith
the
lord
god
15
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
15
2
son
of
man
what
is
the
vine
tree
more
than
any
tree
or
than
a
branch
which
is
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
15
3
shall
wood
be
taken
thereof
to
do
any
work
or
will
men
take
a
pin
of
it
to
hang
any
vessel
thereon
15
4
behold
it
is
cast
into
the
fire
for
fuel
the
fire
devoureth
both
the
ends
of
it
and
the
midst
of
it
is
burned
is
it
meet
for
any
work
15
5
behold
when
it
was
whole
it
was
meet
for
no
work
how
much
less
shall
it
be
meet
yet
for
any
work
when
the
fire
hath
devoured
it
and
it
is
burned
15
6
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
the
vine
tree
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
which
i
have
given
to
the
fire
for
fuel
so
will
i
give
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
15
7
and
i
will
set
my
face
against
them
they
shall
go
out
from
one
fire
and
another
fire
shall
devour
them
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
set
my
face
against
them
15
8
and
i
will
make
the
land
desolate
because
they
have
committed
a
trespass
saith
the
lord
god
16
1
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
16
2
son
of
man
cause
jerusalem
to
know
her
abominations
16
3
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
jerusalem
thy
birth
and
thy
nativity
is
of
the
land
of
canaan
thy
father
was
an
amorite
and
thy
mother
an
hittite
16
4
and
as
for
thy
nativity
in
the
day
thou
wast
born
thy
navel
was
not
cut
neither
wast
thou
washed
in
water
to
supple
thee
thou
wast
not
salted
at
all
nor
swaddled
at
all
16
5
none
eye
pitied
thee
to
do
any
of
these
unto
thee
to
have
compassion
upon
thee
but
thou
wast
cast
out
in
the
open
field
to
the
lothing
of
thy
person
in
the
day
that
thou
wast
born
16
6
and
when
i
passed
by
thee
and
saw
thee
polluted
in
thine
own
blood
i
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood
live
yea
i
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood
live
16
7
i
have
caused
thee
to
multiply
as
the
bud
of
the
field
and
thou
hast
increased
and
waxen
great
and
thou
art
come
to
excellent
ornaments
thy
breasts
are
fashioned
and
thine
hair
is
grown
whereas
thou
wast
naked
and
bare
16
8
now
when
i
passed
by
thee
and
looked
upon
thee
behold
thy
time
was
the
time
of
love
and
i
spread
my
skirt
over
thee
and
covered
thy
nakedness
yea
i
sware
unto
thee
and
entered
into
a
covenant
with
thee
saith
the
lord
god
and
thou
becamest
mine
16
9
then
washed
i
thee
with
water
yea
i
throughly
washed
away
thy
blood
from
thee
and
i
anointed
thee
with
oil
16
10
i
clothed
thee
also
with
broidered
work
and
shod
thee
with
badgers’
skin
and
i
girded
thee
about
with
fine
linen
and
i
covered
thee
with
silk
16
11
i
decked
thee
also
with
ornaments
and
i
put
bracelets
upon
thy
hands
and
a
chain
on
thy
neck
16
12
and
i
put
a
jewel
on
thy
forehead
and
earrings
in
thine
ears
and
a
beautiful
crown
upon
thine
head
16
13
thus
wast
thou
decked
with
gold
and
silver
and
thy
raiment
was
of
fine
linen
and
silk
and
broidered
work
thou
didst
eat
fine
flour
and
honey
and
oil
and
thou
wast
exceeding
beautiful
and
thou
didst
prosper
into
a
kingdom
16
14
and
thy
renown
went
forth
among
the
heathen
for
thy
beauty
for
it
was
perfect
through
my
comeliness
which
i
had
put
upon
thee
saith
the
lord
god
16
15
but
thou
didst
trust
in
thine
own
beauty
and
playedst
the
harlot
because
of
thy
renown
and
pouredst
out
thy
fornications
on
every
one
that
passed
by
his
it
was
16
16
and
of
thy
garments
thou
didst
take
and
deckedst
thy
high
places
with
divers
colours
and
playedst
the
harlot
thereupon
the
like
things
shall
not
come
neither
shall
it
be
so
16
17
thou
hast
also
taken
thy
fair
jewels
of
my
gold
and
of
my
silver
which
i
had
given
thee
and
madest
to
thyself
images
of
men
and
didst
commit
whoredom
with
them
16
18
and
tookest
thy
broidered
garments
and
coveredst
them
and
thou
hast
set
mine
oil
and
mine
incense
before
them
16
19
my
meat
also
which
i
gave
thee
fine
flour
and
oil
and
honey
wherewith
i
fed
thee
thou
hast
even
set
it
before
them
for
a
sweet
savour
and
thus
it
was
saith
the
lord
god
16
20
moreover
thou
hast
taken
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
whom
thou
hast
borne
unto
me
and
these
hast
thou
sacrificed
unto
them
to
be
devoured
is
this
of
thy
whoredoms
a
small
matter
16
21
that
thou
hast
slain
my
children
and
delivered
them
to
cause
them
to
pass
through
the
fire
for
them
16
22
and
in
all
thine
abominations
and
thy
whoredoms
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth
when
thou
wast
naked
and
bare
and
wast
polluted
in
thy
blood
16
23
and
it
came
to
pass
after
all
thy
wickedness
(woe
woe
unto
thee
saith
the
lord
god
)
16
24
that
thou
hast
also
built
unto
thee
an
eminent
place
and
hast
made
thee
an
high
place
in
every
street
16
25
thou
hast
built
thy
high
place
at
every
head
of
the
way
and
hast
made
thy
beauty
to
be
abhorred
and
hast
opened
thy
feet
to
every
one
that
passed
by
and
multiplied
thy
whoredoms
16
26
thou
hast
also
committed
fornication
with
the
egyptians
thy
neighbours
great
of
flesh
and
hast
increased
thy
whoredoms
to
provoke
me
to
anger
16
27
behold
therefore
i
have
stretched
out
my
hand
over
thee
and
have
diminished
thine
ordinary
food
and
delivered
thee
unto
the
will
of
them
that
hate
thee
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
which
are
ashamed
of
thy
lewd
way
16
28
thou
hast
played
the
whore
also
with
the
assyrians
because
thou
wast
unsatiable
yea
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
them
and
yet
couldest
not
be
satisfied
16
29
thou
hast
moreover
multiplied
thy
fornication
in
the
land
of
canaan
unto
chaldea
and
yet
thou
wast
not
satisfied
therewith
16
30
how
weak
is
thine
heart
saith
the
lord
god
seeing
thou
doest
all
these
things
the
work
of
an
imperious
whorish
woman
16
31
in
that
thou
buildest
thine
eminent
place
in
the
head
of
every
way
and
makest
thine
high
place
in
every
street
and
hast
not
been
as
an
harlot
in
that
thou
scornest
hire
16
32
but
as
a
wife
that
committeth
adultery
which
taketh
strangers
instead
of
her
husband
16
33
they
give
gifts
to
all
whores
but
thou
givest
thy
gifts
to
all
thy
lovers
and
hirest
them
that
they
may
come
unto
thee
on
every
side
for
thy
whoredom
16
34
and
the
contrary
is
in
thee
from
other
women
in
thy
whoredoms
whereas
none
followeth
thee
to
commit
whoredoms
and
in
that
thou
givest
a
reward
and
no
reward
is
given
unto
thee
therefore
thou
art
contrary
16
35
wherefore
o
harlot
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
16
36
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thy
filthiness
was
poured
out
and
thy
nakedness
discovered
through
thy
whoredoms
with
thy
lovers
and
with
all
the
idols
of
thy
abominations
and
by
the
blood
of
thy
children
which
thou
didst
give
unto
them
16
37
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
all
thy
lovers
with
whom
thou
hast
taken
pleasure
and
all
them
that
thou
hast
loved
with
all
them
that
thou
hast
hated
i
will
even
gather
them
round
about
against
thee
and
will
discover
thy
nakedness
unto
them
that
they
may
see
all
thy
nakedness
16
38
and
i
will
judge
thee
as
women
that
break
wedlock
and
shed
blood
are
judged
and
i
will
give
thee
blood
in
fury
and
jealousy
16
39
and
i
will
also
give
thee
into
their
hand
and
they
shall
throw
down
thine
eminent
place
and
shall
break
down
thy
high
places
they
shall
strip
thee
also
of
thy
clothes
and
shall
take
thy
fair
jewels
and
leave
thee
naked
and
bare
16
40
they
shall
also
bring
up
a
company
against
thee
and
they
shall
stone
thee
with
stones
and
thrust
thee
through
with
their
swords
16
41
and
they
shall
burn
thine
houses
with
fire
and
execute
judgments
upon
thee
in
the
sight
of
many
women
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
cease
from
playing
the
harlot
and
thou
also
shalt
give
no
hire
any
more
16
42
so
will
i
make
my
fury
toward
thee
to
rest
and
my
jealousy
shall
depart
from
thee
and
i
will
be
quiet
and
will
be
no
more
angry
16
43
because
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth
but
hast
fretted
me
in
all
these
things
behold
therefore
i
also
will
recompense
thy
way
upon
thine
head
saith
the
lord
god
and
thou
shalt
not
commit
this
lewdness
above
all
thine
abominations
16
44
behold
every
one
that
useth
proverbs
shall
use
this
proverb
against
thee
saying
as
is
the
mother
so
is
her
daughter
16
45
thou
art
thy
mother’s
daughter
that
lotheth
her
husband
and
her
children
and
thou
art
the
sister
of
thy
sisters
which
lothed
their
husbands
and
their
children
your
mother
was
an
hittite
and
your
father
an
amorite
16
46
and
thine
elder
sister
is
samaria
she
and
her
daughters
that
dwell
at
thy
left
hand
and
thy
younger
sister
that
dwelleth
at
thy
right
hand
is
sodom
and
her
daughters
16
47
yet
hast
thou
not
walked
after
their
ways
nor
done
after
their
abominations
but
as
if
that
were
a
very
little
thing
thou
wast
corrupted
more
than
they
in
all
thy
ways
16
48
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
sodom
thy
sister
hath
not
done
she
nor
her
daughters
as
thou
hast
done
thou
and
thy
daughters
16
49
behold
this
was
the
iniquity
of
thy
sister
sodom
pride
fulness
of
bread
and
abundance
of
idleness
was
in
her
and
in
her
daughters
neither
did
she
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
poor
and
needy
16
50
and
they
were
haughty
and
committed
abomination
before
me
therefore
i
took
them
away
as
i
saw
good
16
51
neither
hath
samaria
committed
half
of
thy
sins
but
thou
hast
multiplied
thine
abominations
more
than
they
and
hast
justified
thy
sisters
in
all
thine
abominations
which
thou
hast
done
16
52
thou
also
which
hast
judged
thy
sisters
bear
thine
own
shame
for
thy
sins
that
thou
hast
committed
more
abominable
than
they
they
are
more
righteous
than
thou
yea
be
thou
confounded
also
and
bear
thy
shame
in
that
thou
hast
justified
thy
sisters
16
53
when
i
shall
bring
again
their
captivity
the
captivity
of
sodom
and
her
daughters
and
the
captivity
of
samaria
and
her
daughters
then
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
thy
captives
in
the
midst
of
them
16
54
that
thou
mayest
bear
thine
own
shame
and
mayest
be
confounded
in
all
that
thou
hast
done
in
that
thou
art
a
comfort
unto
them
16
55
when
thy
sisters
sodom
and
her
daughters
shall
return
to
their
former
estate
and
samaria
and
her
daughters
shall
return
to
their
former
estate
then
thou
and
thy
daughters
shall
return
to
your
former
estate
16
56
for
thy
sister
sodom
was
not
mentioned
by
thy
mouth
in
the
day
of
thy
pride
16
57
before
thy
wickedness
was
discovered
as
at
the
time
of
thy
reproach
of
the
daughters
of
syria
and
all
that
are
round
about
her
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
which
despise
thee
round
about
16
58
thou
hast
borne
thy
lewdness
and
thine
abominations
saith
the
lord
16
59
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
deal
with
thee
as
thou
hast
done
which
hast
despised
the
oath
in
breaking
the
covenant
16
60
nevertheless
i
will
remember
my
covenant
with
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
and
i
will
establish
unto
thee
an
everlasting
covenant
16
61
then
thou
shalt
remember
thy
ways
and
be
ashamed
when
thou
shalt
receive
thy
sisters
thine
elder
and
thy
younger
and
i
will
give
them
unto
thee
for
daughters
but
not
by
thy
covenant
16
62
and
i
will
establish
my
covenant
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
16
63
that
thou
mayest
remember
and
be
confounded
and
never
open
thy
mouth
any
more
because
of
thy
shame
when
i
am
pacified
toward
thee
for
all
that
thou
hast
done
saith
the
lord
god
17
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
17
2
son
of
man
put
forth
a
riddle
and
speak
a
parable
unto
the
house
of
israel
17
3
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
a
great
eagle
with
great
wings
longwinged
full
of
feathers
which
had
divers
colours
came
unto
lebanon
and
took
the
highest
branch
of
the
cedar
17
4
he
cropped
off
the
top
of
his
young
twigs
and
carried
it
into
a
land
of
traffick
he
set
it
in
a
city
of
merchants
17
5
he
took
also
of
the
seed
of
the
land
and
planted
it
in
a
fruitful
field
he
placed
it
by
great
waters
and
set
it
as
a
willow
tree
17
6
and
it
grew
and
became
a
spreading
vine
of
low
stature
whose
branches
turned
toward
him
and
the
roots
thereof
were
under
him
so
it
became
a
vine
and
brought
forth
branches
and
shot
forth
sprigs
17
7
there
was
also
another
great
eagle
with
great
wings
and
many
feathers
and
behold
this
vine
did
bend
her
roots
toward
him
and
shot
forth
her
branches
toward
him
that
he
might
water
it
by
the
furrows
of
her
plantation
17
8
it
was
planted
in
a
good
soil
by
great
waters
that
it
might
bring
forth
branches
and
that
it
might
bear
fruit
that
it
might
be
a
goodly
vine
17
9
say
thou
thus
saith
the
lord
god
shall
it
prosper
shall
he
not
pull
up
the
roots
thereof
and
cut
off
the
fruit
thereof
that
it
wither
it
shall
wither
in
all
the
leaves
of
her
spring
even
without
great
power
or
many
people
to
pluck
it
up
by
the
roots
thereof
17
10
yea
behold
being
planted
shall
it
prosper
shall
it
not
utterly
wither
when
the
east
wind
toucheth
it
it
shall
wither
in
the
furrows
where
it
grew
17
11
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
17
12
say
now
to
the
rebellious
house
know
ye
not
what
these
things
mean
tell
them
behold
the
king
of
babylon
is
come
to
jerusalem
and
hath
taken
the
king
thereof
and
the
princes
thereof
and
led
them
with
him
to
babylon
17
13
and
hath
taken
of
the
king’s
seed
and
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
hath
taken
an
oath
of
him
he
hath
also
taken
the
mighty
of
the
land
17
14
that
the
kingdom
might
be
base
that
it
might
not
lift
itself
up
but
that
by
keeping
of
his
covenant
it
might
stand
17
15
but
he
rebelled
against
him
in
sending
his
ambassadors
into
egypt
that
they
might
give
him
horses
and
much
people
shall
he
prosper
shall
he
escape
that
doeth
such
things
or
shall
he
break
the
covenant
and
be
delivered
17
16
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
in
the
place
where
the
king
dwelleth
that
made
him
king
whose
oath
he
despised
and
whose
covenant
he
brake
even
with
him
in
the
midst
of
babylon
he
shall
die
17
17
neither
shall
pharaoh
with
his
mighty
army
and
great
company
make
for
him
in
the
war
by
casting
up
mounts
and
building
forts
to
cut
off
many
persons
17
18
seeing
he
despised
the
oath
by
breaking
the
covenant
when
lo
he
had
given
his
hand
and
hath
done
all
these
things
he
shall
not
escape
17
19
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
i
live
surely
mine
oath
that
he
hath
despised
and
my
covenant
that
he
hath
broken
even
it
will
i
recompense
upon
his
own
head
17
20
and
i
will
spread
my
net
upon
him
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare
and
i
will
bring
him
to
babylon
and
will
plead
with
him
there
for
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed
against
me
17
21
and
all
his
fugitives
with
all
his
bands
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
they
that
remain
shall
be
scattered
toward
all
winds
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
17
22
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
also
take
of
the
highest
branch
of
the
high
cedar
and
will
set
it
i
will
crop
off
from
the
top
of
his
young
twigs
a
tender
one
and
will
plant
it
upon
an
high
mountain
and
eminent
17
23
in
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
israel
will
i
plant
it
and
it
shall
bring
forth
boughs
and
bear
fruit
and
be
a
goodly
cedar
and
under
it
shall
dwell
all
fowl
of
every
wing
in
the
shadow
of
the
branches
thereof
shall
they
dwell
17
24
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
brought
down
the
high
tree
have
exalted
the
low
tree
have
dried
up
the
green
tree
and
have
made
the
dry
tree
to
flourish
i
the
lord
have
spoken
and
have
done
it
18
1
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
again
saying
18
2
what
mean
ye
that
ye
use
this
proverb
concerning
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children’s
teeth
are
set
on
edge
18
3
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
israel
18
4
behold
all
souls
are
mine
as
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
18
5
but
if
a
man
be
just
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
18
6
and
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
neither
hath
defiled
his
neighbour’s
wife
neither
hath
come
near
to
a
menstruous
woman
18
7
and
hath
not
oppressed
any
but
hath
restored
to
the
debtor
his
pledge
hath
spoiled
none
by
violence
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment
18
8
he
that
hath
not
given
forth
upon
usury
neither
hath
taken
any
increase
that
hath
withdrawn
his
hand
from
iniquity
hath
executed
true
judgment
between
man
and
man
18
9
hath
walked
in
my
statutes
and
hath
kept
my
judgments
to
deal
truly
he
is
just
he
shall
surely
live
saith
the
lord
god
18
10
if
he
beget
a
son
that
is
a
robber
a
shedder
of
blood
and
that
doeth
the
like
to
any
one
of
these
things
18
11
and
that
doeth
not
any
of
those
duties
but
even
hath
eaten
upon
the
mountains
and
defiled
his
neighbour’s
wife
18
12
hath
oppressed
the
poor
and
needy
hath
spoiled
by
violence
hath
not
restored
the
pledge
and
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
hath
committed
abomination
18
13
hath
given
forth
upon
usury
and
hath
taken
increase
shall
he
then
live
he
shall
not
live
he
hath
done
all
these
abominations
he
shall
surely
die
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him
18
14
now
lo
if
he
beget
a
son
that
seeth
all
his
father’s
sins
which
he
hath
done
and
considereth
and
doeth
not
such
like
18
15
that
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
hath
not
defiled
his
neighbour’s
wife
18
16
neither
hath
oppressed
any
hath
not
withholden
the
pledge
neither
hath
spoiled
by
violence
but
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment
18
17
that
hath
taken
off
his
hand
from
the
poor
that
hath
not
received
usury
nor
increase
hath
executed
my
judgments
hath
walked
in
my
statutes
he
shall
not
die
for
the
iniquity
of
his
father
he
shall
surely
live
18
18
as
for
his
father
because
he
cruelly
oppressed
spoiled
his
brother
by
violence
and
did
that
which
is
not
good
among
his
people
lo
even
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
18
19
yet
say
ye
why
doth
not
the
son
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father
when
the
son
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
and
hath
kept
all
my
statutes
and
hath
done
them
he
shall
surely
live
18
20
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
the
son
shall
not
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father
neither
shall
the
father
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
son
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
be
upon
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
shall
be
upon
him
18
21
but
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
and
keep
all
my
statutes
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
18
22
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
they
shall
not
be
mentioned
unto
him
in
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
he
shall
live
18
23
have
i
any
pleasure
at
all
that
the
wicked
should
die
saith
the
lord
god
and
not
that
he
should
return
from
his
ways
and
live
18
24
but
when
the
righteous
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
and
doeth
according
to
all
the
abominations
that
the
wicked
man
doeth
shall
he
live
all
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
mentioned
in
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed
and
in
his
sin
that
he
hath
sinned
in
them
shall
he
die
18
25
yet
ye
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
hear
now
o
house
of
israel
is
not
my
way
equal
are
not
your
ways
unequal
18
26
when
a
righteous
man
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
and
dieth
in
them
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
done
shall
he
die
18
27
again
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
his
wickedness
that
he
hath
committed
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
save
his
soul
alive
18
28
because
he
considereth
and
turneth
away
from
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
18
29
yet
saith
the
house
of
israel
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
o
house
of
israel
are
not
my
ways
equal
are
not
your
ways
unequal
18
30
therefore
i
will
judge
you
o
house
of
israel
every
one
according
to
his
ways
saith
the
lord
god
repent
and
turn
yourselves
from
all
your
transgressions
so
iniquity
shall
not
be
your
ruin
18
31
cast
away
from
you
all
your
transgressions
whereby
ye
have
transgressed
and
make
you
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
18
32
for
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
him
that
dieth
saith
the
lord
god
wherefore
turn
yourselves
and
live
ye
19

moreover
take
thou
up
a
lamentation
for
the
princes
of
israel
19
2
and
say
what
is
thy
mother
a
lioness
she
lay
down
among
lions
she
nourished
her
whelps
among
young
lions
19
3
and
she
brought
up
one
of
her
whelps
it
became
a
young
lion
and
it
learned
to
catch
the
prey
it
devoured
men
19
4
the
nations
also
heard
of
him
he
was
taken
in
their
pit
and
they
brought
him
with
chains
unto
the
land
of
egypt
19
5
now
when
she
saw
that
she
had
waited
and
her
hope
was
lost
then
she
took
another
of
her
whelps
and
made
him
a
young
lion
19
6
and
he
went
up
and
down
among
the
lions
he
became
a
young
lion
and
learned
to
catch
the
prey
and
devoured
men
19
7
and
he
knew
their
desolate
palaces
and
he
laid
waste
their
cities
and
the
land
was
desolate
and
the
fulness
thereof
by
the
noise
of
his
roaring
19
8
then
the
nations
set
against
him
on
every
side
from
the
provinces
and
spread
their
net
over
him
he
was
taken
in
their
pit
19
9
and
they
put
him
in
ward
in
chains
and
brought
him
to
the
king
of
babylon
they
brought
him
into
holds
that
his
voice
should
no
more
be
heard
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
19
10
thy
mother
is
like
a
vine
in
thy
blood
planted
by
the
waters
she
was
fruitful
and
full
of
branches
by
reason
of
many
waters
19
11
and
she
had
strong
rods
for
the
sceptres
of
them
that
bare
rule
and
her
stature
was
exalted
among
the
thick
branches
and
she
appeared
in
her
height
with
the
multitude
of
her
branches
19
12
but
she
was
plucked
up
in
fury
she
was
cast
down
to
the
ground
and
the
east
wind
dried
up
her
fruit
her
strong
rods
were
broken
and
withered
the
fire
consumed
them
19
13
and
now
she
is
planted
in
the
wilderness
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
ground
19
14
and
fire
is
gone
out
of
a
rod
of
her
branches
which
hath
devoured
her
fruit
so
that
she
hath
no
strong
rod
to
be
a
sceptre
to
rule
this
is
a
lamentation
and
shall
be
for
a
lamentation
20
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
in
the
fifth
month
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
that
certain
of
the
elders
of
israel
came
to
enquire
of
the
lord
and
sat
before
me
20
2
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
me
saying
20
3
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
elders
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
are
ye
come
to
enquire
of
me
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you
20
4
wilt
thou
judge
them
son
of
man
wilt
thou
judge
them
cause
them
to
know
the
abominations
of
their
fathers
20
5
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
when
i
chose
israel
and
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
the
seed
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
made
myself
known
unto
them
in
the
land
of
egypt
when
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
saying
i
am
the
lord
your
god
20
6
in
the
day
that
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
to
bring
them
forth
of
the
land
of
egypt
into
a
land
that
i
had
espied
for
them
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands
20
7
then
said
i
unto
them
cast
ye
away
every
man
the
abominations
of
his
eyes
and
defile
not
yourselves
with
the
idols
of
egypt
i
am
the
lord
your
god
20
8
but
they
rebelled
against
me
and
would
not
hearken
unto
me
they
did
not
every
man
cast
away
the
abominations
of
their
eyes
neither
did
they
forsake
the
idols
of
egypt
then
i
said
i
will
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
egypt
20
9
but
i
wrought
for
my
name’s
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen
among
whom
they
were
in
whose
sight
i
made
myself
known
unto
them
in
bringing
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
20
10
wherefore
i
caused
them
to
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
brought
them
into
the
wilderness
20
11
and
i
gave
them
my
statutes
and
shewed
them
my
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
20
12
moreover
also
i
gave
them
my
sabbaths
to
be
a
sign
between
me
and
them
that
they
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
sanctify
them
20
13
but
the
house
of
israel
rebelled
against
me
in
the
wilderness
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes
and
they
despised
my
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
and
my
sabbaths
they
greatly
polluted
then
i
said
i
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
in
the
wilderness
to
consume
them
20
14
but
i
wrought
for
my
name’s
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen
in
whose
sight
i
brought
them
out
20
15
yet
also
i
lifted
up
my
hand
unto
them
in
the
wilderness
that
i
would
not
bring
them
into
the
land
which
i
had
given
them
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands
20
16
because
they
despised
my
judgments
and
walked
not
in
my
statutes
but
polluted
my
sabbaths
for
their
heart
went
after
their
idols
20
17
nevertheless
mine
eye
spared
them
from
destroying
them
neither
did
i
make
an
end
of
them
in
the
wilderness
20
18
but
i
said
unto
their
children
in
the
wilderness
walk
ye
not
in
the
statutes
of
your
fathers
neither
observe
their
judgments
nor
defile
yourselves
with
their
idols
20
19
i
am
the
lord
your
god
walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
my
judgments
and
do
them
20
20
and
hallow
my
sabbaths
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
between
me
and
you
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
20
21
notwithstanding
the
children
rebelled
against
me
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes
neither
kept
my
judgments
to
do
them
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
they
polluted
my
sabbaths
then
i
said
i
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
wilderness
20
22
nevertheless
i
withdrew
mine
hand
and
wrought
for
my
name’s
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
in
whose
sight
i
brought
them
forth
20
23
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
also
in
the
wilderness
that
i
would
scatter
them
among
the
heathen
and
disperse
them
through
the
countries
20
24
because
they
had
not
executed
my
judgments
but
had
despised
my
statutes
and
had
polluted
my
sabbaths
and
their
eyes
were
after
their
fathers’
idols
20
25
wherefore
i
gave
them
also
statutes
that
were
not
good
and
judgments
whereby
they
should
not
live
20
26
and
i
polluted
them
in
their
own
gifts
in
that
they
caused
to
pass
through
the
fire
all
that
openeth
the
womb
that
i
might
make
them
desolate
to
the
end
that
they
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
20
27
therefore
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
yet
in
this
your
fathers
have
blasphemed
me
in
that
they
have
committed
a
trespass
against
me
20
28
for
when
i
had
brought
them
into
the
land
for
the
which
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
them
then
they
saw
every
high
hill
and
all
the
thick
trees
and
they
offered
there
their
sacrifices
and
there
they
presented
the
provocation
of
their
offering
there
also
they
made
their
sweet
savour
and
poured
out
there
their
drink
offerings
20
29
then
i
said
unto
them
what
is
the
high
place
whereunto
ye
go
and
the
name
whereof
is
called
bamah
unto
this
day
20
30
wherefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
are
ye
polluted
after
the
manner
of
your
fathers
and
commit
ye
whoredom
after
their
abominations
20
31
for
when
ye
offer
your
gifts
when
ye
make
your
sons
to
pass
through
the
fire
ye
pollute
yourselves
with
all
your
idols
even
unto
this
day
and
shall
i
be
enquired
of
by
you
o
house
of
israel
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you
20
32
and
that
which
cometh
into
your
mind
shall
not
be
at
all
that
ye
say
we
will
be
as
the
heathen
as
the
families
of
the
countries
to
serve
wood
and
stone
20
33
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
will
i
rule
over
you
20
34
and
i
will
bring
you
out
from
the
people
and
will
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
are
scattered
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
20
35
and
i
will
bring
you
into
the
wilderness
of
the
people
and
there
will
i
plead
with
you
face
to
face
20
36
like
as
i
pleaded
with
your
fathers
in
the
wilderness
of
the
land
of
egypt
so
will
i
plead
with
you
saith
the
lord
god
20
37
and
i
will
cause
you
to
pass
under
the
rod
and
i
will
bring
you
into
the
bond
of
the
covenant
20
38
and
i
will
purge
out
from
among
you
the
rebels
and
them
that
transgress
against
me
i
will
bring
them
forth
out
of
the
country
where
they
sojourn
and
they
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
20
39
as
for
you
o
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
go
ye
serve
ye
every
one
his
idols
and
hereafter
also
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
but
pollute
ye
my
holy
name
no
more
with
your
gifts
and
with
your
idols
20
40
for
in
mine
holy
mountain
in
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
all
the
house
of
israel
all
of
them
in
the
land
serve
me
there
will
i
accept
them
and
there
will
i
require
your
offerings
and
the
firstfruits
of
your
oblations
with
all
your
holy
things
20
41
i
will
accept
you
with
your
sweet
savour
when
i
bring
you
out
from
the
people
and
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
have
been
scattered
and
i
will
be
sanctified
in
you
before
the
heathen
20
42
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
bring
you
into
the
land
of
israel
into
the
country
for
the
which
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
your
fathers
20
43
and
there
shall
ye
remember
your
ways
and
all
your
doings
wherein
ye
have
been
defiled
and
ye
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
all
your
evils
that
ye
have
committed
20
44
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
wrought
with
you
for
my
name’s
sake
not
according
to
your
wicked
ways
nor
according
to
your
corrupt
doings
o
ye
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
20
45
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
20
46
son
of
man
set
thy
face
toward
the
south
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
south
and
prophesy
against
the
forest
of
the
south
field
20
47
and
say
to
the
forest
of
the
south
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
thee
and
it
shall
devour
every
green
tree
in
thee
and
every
dry
tree
the
flaming
flame
shall
not
be
quenched
and
all
faces
from
the
south
to
the
north
shall
be
burned
therein
20
48
and
all
flesh
shall
see
that
i
the
lord
have
kindled
it
it
shall
not
be
quenched
20
49
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
they
say
of
me
doth
he
not
speak
parables
21
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
21
2
son
of
man
set
thy
face
toward
jerusalem
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
holy
places
and
prophesy
against
the
land
of
israel
21
3
and
say
to
the
land
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
am
against
thee
and
will
draw
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath
and
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
21
4
seeing
then
that
i
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
therefore
shall
my
sword
go
forth
out
of
his
sheath
against
all
flesh
from
the
south
to
the
north
21
5
that
all
flesh
may
know
that
i
the
lord
have
drawn
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath
it
shall
not
return
any
more
21
6
sigh
therefore
thou
son
of
man
with
the
breaking
of
thy
loins
and
with
bitterness
sigh
before
their
eyes
21
7
and
it
shall
be
when
they
say
unto
thee
wherefore
sighest
thou
that
thou
shalt
answer
for
the
tidings
because
it
cometh
and
every
heart
shall
melt
and
all
hands
shall
be
feeble
and
every
spirit
shall
faint
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as
water
behold
it
cometh
and
shall
be
brought
to
pass
saith
the
lord
god
21
8
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
21
9
son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
say

sword

sword
is
sharpened
and
also

21
10
it
is
sharpened
to
make
a
sore
slaughter

is
furbished
that
it
may
glitter
should
we
then
make
mirth
it
contemneth
the
rod
of
my
son
as
every
tree
21
11
and
he
hath
given
it
to
be
furbished
that
it
may
be
handled
this
sword
is
sharpened
and
it
is
furbished
to
give
it
into
the
hand
of
the
slayer
21
12
cry
and
howl
son
of
man
for
it
shall
be
upon
my
people
it
shall
be
upon
all
the
princes
of
israel

by
reason
of
the
sword

be
upon
my
people

therefore
upon
thy
thigh
21
13
because
it
is
a
trial
and
what
if
the
sword
contemn
even
the
rod
it
shall
be
no
more
saith
the
lord
god
21
14
thou
therefore
son
of
man
prophesy
and
smite
thine
hands
together
and
let
the
sword
be
doubled
the
third
time
the
sword
of
the
slain

is
the
sword
of
the
great
men
that
are
slain
which
entereth
into
their
privy
chambers
21
15
i
have
set
the
point
of
the
sword
against
all
their
gates
that
their
heart
may
faint
and
their
ruins
be
multiplied
ah
it
is
made
bright
it
is
wrapped
up
for
the
slaughter
21
16

thee
one
way
or
other

on
the
right
hand
or
on
the
left

face

17
i

hands
together
and
i
will
cause
my
fury
to
rest
i
the
lord
have
said
it
21
18
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
again
saying
21
19
also
thou
son
of
man
appoint
thee
two
ways
that
the
sword
of
the
king
of
babylon
may
come
both
twain
shall
come
forth
out
of
one
land
and
choose
thou
a
place
choose
it
at
the
head
of
the
way
to
the
city
21
20
appoint
a
way
that
the
sword
may
come
to
rabbath
of
the
ammonites
and
to
judah
in
jerusalem
the
defenced
21
21
for
the
king
of
babylon
stood
at
the
parting
of
the
way
at
the
head
of
the
two
ways
to
use
divination
he
made
his
arrows
bright
he
consulted
with
images
he
looked
in
the
liver
21
22
at
his
right
hand
was
the
divination
for
jerusalem
to
appoint
captains
to
open
the
mouth
in
the
slaughter
to
lift
up
the
voice
with
shouting
to
appoint
battering
rams
against
the
gates
to
cast
a
mount
and
to
build
a
fort
21
23
and
it
shall
be
unto
them
as
a
false
divination
in
their
sight
to
them
that
have
sworn
oaths
but
he
will
call
to
remembrance
the
iniquity
that
they
may
be
taken
21
24
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
have
made
your
iniquity
to
be
remembered
in
that
your
transgressions
are
discovered
so
that
in
all
your
doings
your
sins
do
appear
because
i
say
that
ye
are
come
to
remembrance
ye
shall
be
taken
with
the
hand
21
25
and
thou
profane
wicked
prince
of
israel
whose
day
is
come
when
iniquity
shall
have
an
end
21
26
thus
saith
the
lord
god
remove
the
diadem
and
take
off
the
crown
this
shall
not
be
the
same
exalt
him
that
is
low
and
abase
him
that
is
high
21
27
i
will
overturn
overturn
overturn
it
and
it
shall
be
no
more
until
he
come
whose
right
it
is
and
i
will
give
it
him
21
28
and
thou
son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
concerning
the
ammonites
and
concerning
their
reproach
even
say
thou
the
sword
the
sword
is
drawn
for
the
slaughter
it
is
furbished
to
consume
because
of
the
glittering
21
29
whiles
they
see
vanity
unto
thee
whiles
they
divine
a
lie
unto
thee
to
bring
thee
upon
the
necks
of
them
that
are
slain
of
the
wicked
whose
day
is
come
when
their
iniquity
shall
have
an
end
21
30
shall
i
cause
it
to
return
into
his
sheath
i
will
judge
thee
in
the
place
where
thou
wast
created
in
the
land
of
thy
nativity
21
31
and
i
will
pour
out
mine
indignation
upon
thee
i
will
blow
against
thee
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath
and
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
brutish
men
and
skilful
to
destroy
21
32
thou
shalt
be
for
fuel
to
the
fire
thy
blood
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
land
thou
shalt
be
no
more
remembered
for
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
22
1
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
22
2
now
thou
son
of
man
wilt
thou
judge
wilt
thou
judge
the
bloody
city
yea
thou
shalt
shew
her
all
her
abominations
22
3
then
say
thou
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
city
sheddeth
blood
in
the
midst
of
it
that
her
time
may
come
and
maketh
idols
against
herself
to
defile
herself
22
4
thou
art
become
guilty
in
thy
blood
that
thou
hast
shed
and
hast
defiled
thyself
in
thine
idols
which
thou
hast
made
and
thou
hast
caused
thy
days
to
draw
near
and
art
come
even
unto
thy
years
therefore
have
i
made
thee
a
reproach
unto
the
heathen
and
a
mocking
to
all
countries
22
5
those
that
be
near
and
those
that
be
far
from
thee
shall
mock
thee
which
art
infamous
and
much
vexed
22
6
behold
the
princes
of
israel
every
one
were
in
thee
to
their
power
to
shed
blood
22
7
in
thee
have
they
set
light
by
father
and
mother
in
the
midst
of
thee
have
they
dealt
by
oppression
with
the
stranger
in
thee
have
they
vexed
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
22
8
thou
hast
despised
mine
holy
things
and
hast
profaned
my
sabbaths
22
9
in
thee
are
men
that
carry
tales
to
shed
blood
and
in
thee
they
eat
upon
the
mountains
in
the
midst
of
thee
they
commit
lewdness
22
10
in
thee
have
they
discovered
their
fathers’
nakedness
in
thee
have
they
humbled
her
that
was
set
apart
for
pollution
22
11
and
one
hath
committed
abomination
with
his
neighbour’s
wife
and
another
hath
lewdly
defiled
his
daughter
in
law
and
another
in
thee
hath
humbled
his
sister
his
father’s
daughter
22
12
in
thee
have
they
taken
gifts
to
shed
blood
thou
hast
taken
usury
and
increase
and
thou
hast
greedily
gained
of
thy
neighbours
by
extortion
and
hast
forgotten
me
saith
the
lord
god
22
13
behold
therefore
i
have
smitten
mine
hand
at
thy
dishonest
gain
which
thou
hast
made
and
at
thy
blood
which
hath
been
in
the
midst
of
thee
22
14
can
thine
heart
endure
or
can
thine
hands
be
strong
in
the
days
that
i
shall
deal
with
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
will
do
it
22
15
and
i
will
scatter
thee
among
the
heathen
and
disperse
thee
in
the
countries
and
will
consume
thy
filthiness
out
of
thee
22
16
and
thou
shalt
take
thine
inheritance
in
thyself
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
22
17
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
22
18
son
of
man
the
house
of
israel
is
to
me
become
dross
all
they
are
brass
and
tin
and
iron
and
lead
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace
they
are
even
the
dross
of
silver
22
19
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
are
all
become
dross
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
you
into
the
midst
of
jerusalem
22
20
as
they
gather
silver
and
brass
and
iron
and
lead
and
tin
into
the
midst
of
the
furnace
to
blow
the
fire
upon
it
to
melt
it
so
will
i
gather
you
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
i
will
leave
you
there
and
melt
you
22
21
yea
i
will
gather
you
and
blow
upon
you
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath
and
ye
shall
be
melted
in
the
midst
therof
22
22
as
silver
is
melted
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace
so
shall
ye
be
melted
in
the
midst
thereof
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
poured
out
my
fury
upon
you
22
23
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
22
24
son
of
man
say
unto
her
thou
art
the
land
that
is
not
cleansed
nor
rained
upon
in
the
day
of
indignation
22
25
there
is
a
conspiracy
of
her
prophets
in
the
midst
thereof
like
a
roaring
lion
ravening
the
prey
they
have
devoured
souls
they
have
taken
the
treasure
and
precious
things
they
have
made
her
many
widows
in
the
midst
thereof
22
26
her
priests
have
violated
my
law
and
have
profaned
mine
holy
things
they
have
put
no
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane
neither
have
they
shewed
difference
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean
and
have
hid
their
eyes
from
my
sabbaths
and
i
am
profaned
among
them
22
27
her
princes
in
the
midst
thereof
are
like
wolves
ravening
the
prey
to
shed
blood
and
to
destroy
souls
to
get
dishonest
gain
22
28
and
her
prophets
have
daubed
them
with
untempered
morter
seeing
vanity
and
divining
lies
unto
them
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
22
29
the
people
of
the
land
have
used
oppression
and
exercised
robbery
and
have
vexed
the
poor
and
needy
yea
they
have
oppressed
the
stranger
wrongfully
22
30
and
i
sought
for
a
man
among
them
that
should
make
up
the
hedge
and
stand
in
the
gap
before
me
for
the
land
that
i
should
not
destroy
it
but
i
found
none
22
31
therefore
have
i
poured
out
mine
indignation
upon
them
i
have
consumed
them
with
the
fire
of
my
wrath
their
own
way
have
i
recompensed
upon
their
heads
saith
the
lord
god
23
1
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
23
2
son
of
man
there
were
two
women
the
daughters
of
one
mother
23
3
and
they
committed
whoredoms
in
egypt
they
committed
whoredoms
in
their
youth
there
were
their
breasts
pressed
and
there
they
bruised
the
teats
of
their
virginity
23
4
and
the
names
of
them
were
aholah
the
elder
and
aholibah
her
sister
and
they
were
mine
and
they
bare
sons
and
daughters
thus
were
their
names
samaria
is
aholah
and
jerusalem
aholibah
23
5
and
aholah
played
the
harlot
when
she
was
mine
and
she
doted
on
her
lovers
on
the
assyrians
her
neighbours
23
6
which
were
clothed
with
blue
captains
and
rulers
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
23
7
thus
she
committed
her
whoredoms
with
them
with
all
them
that
were
the
chosen
men
of
assyria
and
with
all
on
whom
she
doted
with
all
their
idols
she
defiled
herself
23
8
neither
left
she
her
whoredoms
brought
from
egypt
for
in
her
youth
they
lay
with
her
and
they
bruised
the
breasts
of
her
virginity
and
poured
their
whoredom
upon
her
23
9
wherefore
i
have
delivered
her
into
the
hand
of
her
lovers
into
the
hand
of
the
assyrians
upon
whom
she
doted
23
10
these
discovered
her
nakedness
they
took
her
sons
and
her
daughters
and
slew
her
with
the
sword
and
she
became
famous
among
women
for
they
had
executed
judgment
upon
her
23
11
and
when
her
sister
aholibah
saw
this
she
was
more
corrupt
in
her
inordinate
love
than
she
and
in
her
whoredoms
more
than
her
sister
in
her
whoredoms
23
12
she
doted
upon
the
assyrians
her
neighbours
captains
and
rulers
clothed
most
gorgeously
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
23
13
then
i
saw
that
she
was
defiled
that
they
took
both
one
way
23
14
and
that
she
increased
her
whoredoms
for
when
she
saw
men
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall
the
images
of
the
chaldeans
pourtrayed
with
vermilion
23
15
girded
with
girdles
upon
their
loins
exceeding
in
dyed
attire
upon
their
heads
all
of
them
princes
to
look
to
after
the
manner
of
the
babylonians
of
chaldea
the
land
of
their
nativity
23
16
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
with
her
eyes
she
doted
upon
them
and
sent
messengers
unto
them
into
chaldea
23
17
and
the
babylonians
came
to
her
into
the
bed
of
love
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
whoredom
and
she
was
polluted
with
them
and
her
mind
was
alienated
from
them
23
18
so
she
discovered
her
whoredoms
and
discovered
her
nakedness
then
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her
like
as
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her
sister
23
19
yet
she
multiplied
her
whoredoms
in
calling
to
remembrance
the
days
of
her
youth
wherein
she
had
played
the
harlot
in
the
land
of
egypt
23
20
for
she
doted
upon
their
paramours
whose
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
asses
and
whose
issue
is
like
the
issue
of
horses
23
21
thus
thou
calledst
to
remembrance
the
lewdness
of
thy
youth
in
bruising
thy
teats
by
the
egyptians
for
the
paps
of
thy
youth
23
22
therefore
o
aholibah
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
raise
up
thy
lovers
against
thee
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated
and
i
will
bring
them
against
thee
on
every
side
23
23
the
babylonians
and
all
the
chaldeans
pekod
and
shoa
and
koa
and
all
the
assyrians
with
them
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
captains
and
rulers
great
lords
and
renowned
all
of
them
riding
upon
horses
23
24
and
they
shall
come
against
thee
with
chariots
wagons
and
wheels
and
with
an
assembly
of
people
which
shall
set
against
thee
buckler
and
shield
and
helmet
round
about
and
i
will
set
judgment
before
them
and
they
shall
judge
thee
according
to
their
judgments
23
25
and
i
will
set
my
jealousy
against
thee
and
they
shall
deal
furiously
with
thee
they
shall
take
away
thy
nose
and
thine
ears
and
thy
remnant
shall
fall
by
the
sword
they
shall
take
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
and
thy
residue
shall
be
devoured
by
the
fire
23
26
they
shall
also
strip
thee
out
of
thy
clothes
and
take
away
thy
fair
jewels
23
27
thus
will
i
make
thy
lewdness
to
cease
from
thee
and
thy
whoredom
brought
from
the
land
of
egypt
so
that
thou
shalt
not
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
them
nor
remember
egypt
any
more
23
28
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
whom
thou
hatest
into
the
hand
of
them
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated
23
29
and
they
shall
deal
with
thee
hatefully
and
shall
take
away
all
thy
labour
and
shall
leave
thee
naked
and
bare
and
the
nakedness
of
thy
whoredoms
shall
be
discovered
both
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
23
30
i
will
do
these
things
unto
thee
because
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
after
the
heathen
and
because
thou
art
polluted
with
their
idols
23
31
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
thy
sister
therefore
will
i
give
her
cup
into
thine
hand
23
32
thus
saith
the
lord
god
thou
shalt
drink
of
thy
sister’s
cup
deep
and
large
thou
shalt
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
had
in
derision
it
containeth
much
23
33
thou
shalt
be
filled
with
drunkenness
and
sorrow
with
the
cup
of
astonishment
and
desolation
with
the
cup
of
thy
sister
samaria
23
34
thou
shalt
even
drink
it
and
suck
it
out
and
thou
shalt
break
the
sherds
thereof
and
pluck
off
thine
own
breasts
for
i
have
spoken
it
saith
the
lord
god
23
35
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
forgotten
me
and
cast
me
behind
thy
back
therefore
bear
thou
also
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
23
36
the
lord
said
moreover
unto
me
son
of
man
wilt
thou
judge
aholah
and
aholibah
yea
declare
unto
them
their
abominations
23
37
that
they
have
committed
adultery
and
blood
is
in
their
hands
and
with
their
idols
have
they
committed
adultery
and
have
also
caused
their
sons
whom
they
bare
unto
me
to
pass
for
them
through
the
fire
to
devour
them
23
38
moreover
this
they
have
done
unto
me
they
have
defiled
my
sanctuary
in
the
same
day
and
have
profaned
my
sabbaths
23
39
for
when
they
had
slain
their
children
to
their
idols
then
they
came
the
same
day
into
my
sanctuary
to
profane
it
and
lo
thus
have
they
done
in
the
midst
of
mine
house
23
40
and
furthermore
that
ye
have
sent
for
men
to
come
from
far
unto
whom
a
messenger
was
sent
and
lo
they
came
for
whom
thou
didst
wash
thyself
paintedst
thy
eyes
and
deckedst
thyself
with
ornaments
23
41
and
satest
upon
a
stately
bed
and
a
table
prepared
before
it
whereupon
thou
hast
set
mine
incense
and
mine
oil
23
42
and
a
voice
of
a
multitude
being
at
ease
was
with
her
and
with
the
men
of
the
common
sort
were
brought
sabeans
from
the
wilderness
which
put
bracelets
upon
their
hands
and
beautiful
crowns
upon
their
heads
23
43
then
said
i
unto
her
that
was
old
in
adulteries
will
they
now
commit
whoredoms
with
her
and
she
with
them
23
44
yet
they
went
in
unto
her
as
they
go
in
unto
a
woman
that
playeth
the
harlot
so
went
they
in
unto
aholah
and
unto
aholibah
the
lewd
women
23
45
and
the
righteous
men
they
shall
judge
them
after
the
manner
of
adulteresses
and
after
the
manner
of
women
that
shed
blood
because
they
are
adulteresses
and
blood
is
in
their
hands
23
46
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
bring
up
a
company
upon
them
and
will
give
them
to
be
removed
and
spoiled
23
47
and
the
company
shall
stone
them
with
stones
and
dispatch
them
with
their
swords
they
shall
slay
their
sons
and
their
daughters
and
burn
up
their
houses
with
fire
23
48
thus
will
i
cause
lewdness
to
cease
out
of
the
land
that
all
women
may
be
taught
not
to
do
after
your
lewdness
23
49
and
they
shall
recompense
your
lewdness
upon
you
and
ye
shall
bear
the
sins
of
your
idols
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
24

again
in
the
ninth
year
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
24
2
son
of
man
write
thee
the
name
of
the
day
even
of
this
same
day
the
king
of
babylon
set
himself
against
jerusalem
this
same
day
24
3
and
utter
a
parable
unto
the
rebellious
house
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
set
on
a
pot
set
it
on
and
also
pour
water
into
it
24
4
gather
the
pieces
thereof
into
it
even
every
good
piece
the
thigh
and
the
shoulder
fill
it
with
the
choice
bones
24
5
take
the
choice
of
the
flock
and
burn
also
the
bones
under
it
and
make
it
boil
well
and
let
them
seethe
the
bones
of
it
therein
24
6
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
bloody
city
to
the
pot
whose
scum
is
therein
and
whose
scum
is
not
gone
out
of
it
bring
it
out
piece
by
piece
let
no
lot
fall
upon
it
24
7
for
her
blood
is
in
the
midst
of
her
she
set
it
upon
the
top
of
a
rock
she
poured
it
not
upon
the
ground
to
cover
it
with
dust
24
8
that
it
might
cause
fury
to
come
up
to
take
vengeance
i
have
set
her
blood
upon
the
top
of
a
rock
that
it
should
not
be
covered
24
9
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
bloody
city
i
will
even
make
the
pile
for
fire
great
24
10
heap
on
wood
kindle
the
fire
consume
the
flesh
and
spice
it
well
and
let
the
bones
be
burned
24
11
then
set
it
empty
upon
the
coals
thereof
that
the
brass
of
it
may
be
hot
and
may
burn
and
that
the
filthiness
of
it
may
be
molten
in
it
that
the
scum
of
it
may
be
consumed
24
12
she
hath
wearied
herself
with
lies
and
her
great
scum
went
not
forth
out
of
her
her
scum
shall
be
in
the
fire
24
13
in
thy
filthiness
is
lewdness
because
i
have
purged
thee
and
thou
wast
not
purged
thou
shalt
not
be
purged
from
thy
filthiness
any
more
till
i
have
caused
my
fury
to
rest
upon
thee
24
14
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
it
shall
come
to
pass
and
i
will
do
it
i
will
not
go
back
neither
will
i
spare
neither
will
i
repent
according
to
thy
ways
and
according
to
thy
doings
shall
they
judge
thee
saith
the
lord
god
24
15
also
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
24
16
son
of
man
behold
i
take
away
from
thee
the
desire
of
thine
eyes
with
a
stroke
yet
neither
shalt
thou
mourn
nor
weep
neither
shall
thy
tears
run
down
24
17
forbear
to
cry
make
no
mourning
for
the
dead
bind
the
tire
of
thine
head
upon
thee
and
put
on
thy
shoes
upon
thy
feet
and
cover
not
thy
lips
and
eat
not
the
bread
of
men
24
18
so
i
spake
unto
the
people
in
the
morning
and
at
even
my
wife
died
and
i
did
in
the
morning
as
i
was
commanded
24
19
and
the
people
said
unto
me
wilt
thou
not
tell
us
what
these
things
are
to
us
that
thou
doest
so
24
20
then
i
answered
them
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
24
21
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
profane
my
sanctuary
the
excellency
of
your
strength
the
desire
of
your
eyes
and
that
which
your
soul
pitieth
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
ye
have
left
shall
fall
by
the
sword
24
22
and
ye
shall
do
as
i
have
done
ye
shall
not
cover
your
lips
nor
eat
the
bread
of
men
24
23
and
your
tires
shall
be
upon
your
heads
and
your
shoes
upon
your
feet
ye
shall
not
mourn
nor
weep
but
ye
shall
pine
away
for
your
iniquities
and
mourn
one
toward
another
24
24
thus
ezekiel
is
unto
you
a
sign
according
to
all
that
he
hath
done
shall
ye
do
and
when
this
cometh
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
24
25
also
thou
son
of
man
shall
it
not
be
in
the
day
when
i
take
from
them
their
strength
the
joy
of
their
glory
the
desire
of
their
eyes
and
that
whereupon
they
set
their
minds
their
sons
and
their
daughters
24
26
that
he
that
escapeth
in
that
day
shall
come
unto
thee
to
cause
thee
to
hear
it
with
thine
ears
24
27
in
that
day
shall
thy
mouth
be
opened
to
him
which
is
escaped
and
thou
shalt
speak
and
be
no
more
dumb
and
thou
shalt
be
a
sign
unto
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
25
1
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
25
2
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
the
ammonites
and
prophesy
against
them
25
3
and
say
unto
the
ammonites
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
saidst
aha
against
my
sanctuary
when
it
was
profaned
and
against
the
land
of
israel
when
it
was
desolate
and
against
the
house
of
judah
when
they
went
into
captivity
25
4
behold
therefore
i
will
deliver
thee
to
the
men
of
the
east
for
a
possession
and
they
shall
set
their
palaces
in
thee
and
make
their
dwellings
in
thee
they
shall
eat
thy
fruit
and
they
shall
drink
thy
milk
25
5
and
i
will
make
rabbah
a
stable
for
camels
and
the
ammonites
a
couching
place
for
flocks
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
25
6
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
clapped
thine
hands
and
stamped
with
the
feet
and
rejoiced
in
heart
with
all
thy
despite
against
the
land
of
israel
25
7
behold
therefore
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
thee
and
will
deliver
thee
for
a
spoil
to
the
heathen
and
i
will
cut
thee
off
from
the
people
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
perish
out
of
the
countries
i
will
destroy
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
25
8
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
that
moab
and
seir
do
say
behold
the
house
of
judah
is
like
unto
all
the
heathen
25
9
therefore
behold
i
will
open
the
side
of
moab
from
the
cities
from
his
cities
which
are
on
his
frontiers
the
glory
of
the
country
bethjeshimoth
baalmeon
and
kiriathaim
25
10
unto
the
men
of
the
east
with
the
ammonites
and
will
give
them
in
possession
that
the
ammonites
may
not
be
remembered
among
the
nations
25
11
and
i
will
execute
judgments
upon
moab
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
25
12
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
that
edom
hath
dealt
against
the
house
of
judah
by
taking
vengeance
and
hath
greatly
offended
and
revenged
himself
upon
them
25
13
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
also
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
edom
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
and
i
will
make
it
desolate
from
teman
and
they
of
dedan
shall
fall
by
the
sword
25
14
and
i
will
lay
my
vengeance
upon
edom
by
the
hand
of
my
people
israel
and
they
shall
do
in
edom
according
to
mine
anger
and
according
to
my
fury
and
they
shall
know
my
vengeance
saith
the
lord
god
25
15
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
the
philistines
have
dealt
by
revenge
and
have
taken
vengeance
with
a
despiteful
heart
to
destroy
it
for
the
old
hatred
25
16
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
the
philistines
and
i
will
cut
off
the
cherethims
and
destroy
the
remnant
of
the
sea
coast
25
17
and
i
will
execute
great
vengeance
upon
them
with
furious
rebukes
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
lay
my
vengeance
upon
them
26
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
26
2
son
of
man
because
that
tyrus
hath
said
against
jerusalem
aha
she
is
broken
that
was
the
gates
of
the
people
she
is
turned
unto
me
i
shall
be
replenished
now
she
is
laid
waste
26
3
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
tyrus
and
will
cause
many
nations
to
come
up
against
thee
as
the
sea
causeth
his
waves
to
come
up
26
4
and
they
shall
destroy
the
walls
of
tyrus
and
break
down
her
towers
i
will
also
scrape
her
dust
from
her
and
make
her
like
the
top
of
a
rock
26
5
it
shall
be
a
place
for
the
spreading
of
nets
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
for
i
have
spoken
it
saith
the
lord
god
and
it
shall
become
a
spoil
to
the
nations
26
6
and
her
daughters
which
are
in
the
field
shall
be
slain
by
the
sword
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
26
7
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
bring
upon
tyrus
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
a
king
of
kings
from
the
north
with
horses
and
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
and
companies
and
much
people
26
8
he
shall
slay
with
the
sword
thy
daughters
in
the
field
and
he
shall
make
a
fort
against
thee
and
cast
a
mount
against
thee
and
lift
up
the
buckler
against
thee
26
9
and
he
shall
set
engines
of
war
against
thy
walls
and
with
his
axes
he
shall
break
down
thy
towers
26
10
by
reason
of
the
abundance
of
his
horses
their
dust
shall
cover
thee
thy
walls
shall
shake
at
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
and
of
the
wheels
and
of
the
chariots
when
he
shall
enter
into
thy
gates
as
men
enter
into
a
city
wherein
is
made
a
breach
26
11
with
the
hoofs
of
his
horses
shall
he
tread
down
all
thy
streets
he
shall
slay
thy
people
by
the
sword
and
thy
strong
garrisons
shall
go
down
to
the
ground
26
12
and
they
shall
make
a
spoil
of
thy
riches
and
make
a
prey
of
thy
merchandise
and
they
shall
break
down
thy
walls
and
destroy
thy
pleasant
houses
and
they
shall
lay
thy
stones
and
thy
timber
and
thy
dust
in
the
midst
of
the
water
26
13
and
i
will
cause
the
noise
of
thy
songs
to
cease
and
the
sound
of
thy
harps
shall
be
no
more
heard
26
14
and
i
will
make
thee
like
the
top
of
a
rock
thou
shalt
be
a
place
to
spread
nets
upon
thou
shalt
be
built
no
more
for
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
saith
the
lord
god
26
15
thus
saith
the
lord
god
to
tyrus
shall
not
the
isles
shake
at
the
sound
of
thy
fall
when
the
wounded
cry
when
the
slaughter
is
made
in
the
midst
of
thee
26
16
then
all
the
princes
of
the
sea
shall
come
down
from
their
thrones
and
lay
away
their
robes
and
put
off
their
broidered
garments
they
shall
clothe
themselves
with
trembling
they
shall
sit
upon
the
ground
and
shall
tremble
at
every
moment
and
be
astonished
at
thee
26
17
and
they
shall
take
up
a
lamentation
for
thee
and
say
to
thee
how
art
thou
destroyed
that
wast
inhabited
of
seafaring
men
the
renowned
city
which
wast
strong
in
the
sea
she
and
her
inhabitants
which
cause
their
terror
to
be
on
all
that
haunt
it
26
18
now
shall
the
isles
tremble
in
the
day
of
thy
fall
yea
the
isles
that
are
in
the
sea
shall
be
troubled
at
thy
departure
26
19
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
i
shall
make
thee
a
desolate
city
like
the
cities
that
are
not
inhabited
when
i
shall
bring
up
the
deep
upon
thee
and
great
waters
shall
cover
thee
26
20
when
i
shall
bring
thee
down
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit
with
the
people
of
old
time
and
shall
set
thee
in
the
low
parts
of
the
earth
in
places
desolate
of
old
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
that
thou
be
not
inhabited
and
i
shall
set
glory
in
the
land
of
the
living
26
21
i
will
make
thee
a
terror
and
thou
shalt
be
no
more
though
thou
be
sought
for
yet
shalt
thou
never
be
found
again
saith
the
lord
god
27
1
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
27
2
now
thou
son
of
man
take
up
a
lamentation
for
tyrus
27
3
and
say
unto
tyrus
o
thou
that
art
situate
at
the
entry
of
the
sea
which
art
a
merchant
of
the
people
for
many
isles
thus
saith
the
lord
god
o
tyrus
thou
hast
said
i
am
of
perfect
beauty
27
4
thy
borders
are
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
thy
builders
have
perfected
thy
beauty
27
5
they
have
made
all
thy
ship
boards
of
fir
trees
of
senir
they
have
taken
cedars
from
lebanon
to
make
masts
for
thee
27
6
of
the
oaks
of
bashan
have
they
made
thine
oars
the
company
of
the
ashurites
have
made
thy
benches
of
ivory
brought
out
of
the
isles
of
chittim
27
7
fine
linen
with
broidered
work
from
egypt
was
that
which
thou
spreadest
forth
to
be
thy
sail
blue
and
purple
from
the
isles
of
elishah
was
that
which
covered
thee
27
8
the
inhabitants
of
zidon
and
arvad
were
thy
mariners
thy
wise
men
o
tyrus
that
were
in
thee
were
thy
pilots
27
9
the
ancients
of
gebal
and
the
wise
men
thereof
were
in
thee

the
word
of
the

came
again
unto
me
saying
28
2
son
of
man
say
unto
the
prince
of
tyrus
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thine
heart
is
lifted
up
and
thou
hast
said
i
am
a
god
i
sit
in
the
seat
of
god
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
yet
thou
art
a
man
and
not
god
though
thou
set
thine
heart
as
the
heart
of
god
28
3
behold
thou
art
wiser
than
daniel
there
is
no
secret
that
they
can
hide
from
thee
28
4
with
thy
wisdom
and
with
thine
understanding
thou
hast
gotten
thee
riches
and
hast
gotten
gold
and
silver
into
thy
treasures
28
5
by
thy
great
wisdom
and
by
thy
traffick
hast
thou
increased
thy
riches
and
thine
heart
is
lifted
up
because
of
thy
riches
28
6
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
set
thine
heart
as
the
heart
of
god
28
7
behold
therefore
i
will
bring
strangers
upon
thee
the
terrible
of
the
nations
and
they
shall
draw
their
swords
against
the
beauty
of
thy
wisdom
and
they
shall
defile
thy
brightness
28
8
they
shall
bring
thee
down
to
the
pit
and
thou
shalt
die
the
deaths
of
them
that
are
slain
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
28
9
wilt
thou
yet
say
before
him
that
slayeth
thee
i
am
god
but
thou
shalt
be
a
man
and
no
god
in
the
hand
of
him
that
slayeth
thee
28
10
thou
shalt
die
the
deaths
of
the
uncircumcised
by
the
hand
of
strangers
for
i
have
spoken
it
saith
the
lord
god
28
11
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
28
12
son
of
man
take
up
a
lamentation
upon
the
king
of
tyrus
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
thou
sealest
up
the
sum
full
of
wisdom
and
perfect
in
beauty
28
13
thou
hast
been
in
eden
the
garden
of

was
thy
covering
the
sardius
topaz
and
the
diamond
the
beryl
the

and
the
jasper
the
sapphire
the
emerald
and
the
carbuncle
and
gold
the
workmanship
of
thy
tabrets
and
of
thy
pipes
was
prepared
in
thee
in
the
day
that
thou
wast
created
28
14
thou
art
the
anointed
cherub
that
covereth
and
i
have
set
thee
so
thou
wast
upon
the
holy
mountain
of
god
thou
hast
walked
up
and
down
in
the
midst
of
the
stones
of
fire
28
15
thou
wast
perfect
in
thy
ways
from
the
day
that
thou
wast
created
till
iniquity
was
found
in
thee
28
16
by
the
multitude
of
thy
merchandise
they
have
filled
the
midst
of
thee
with
violence
and
thou
hast
sinned
therefore
i
will
cast
thee
as
profane
out
of
the
mountain
of
god
and
i
will
destroy
thee
o
covering
cherub
from
the
midst
of
the
stones
of
fire
28
17
thine
heart
was
lifted
up
because
of
thy
beauty
thou
hast
corrupted
thy
wisdom
by
reason
of
thy
brightness
i
will
cast
thee
to
the
ground
i
will
lay
thee
before
kings
that
they
may
behold
thee
28
18
thou
hast
defiled
thy
sanctuaries
by
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquities
by
the
iniquity
of
thy
traffick
therefore
will
i
bring
forth
a
fire
from
the
midst
of
thee
it
shall
devour
thee
and
i
will
bring
thee
to
ashes
upon
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
behold
thee
28
19
all
they
that
know
thee
among
the
people
shall
be
astonished
at
thee
thou
shalt
be
a
terror
and
never
shalt
thou
be
any
more
28
20
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
28
21
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
zidon
and
prophesy
against
it
28
22
and
say
thus
saith
the

and
i
will
be
glorified
in

and
they

i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
have
executed
judgments
in

and
shall
be
sanctified
in
her
28
23
for
i
will
send
into
her
pestilence
and
blood
into
her
streets
and
the
wounded
shall
be
judged
in
the
midst
of
her
by
the
sword
upon
her
on
every
side
and
they
shall

28
24
and
there
shall
be
no
more
a
pricking
brier
unto
the
house
of
israel
nor
any
grieving
thorn
of
all
that
are
round
about
them
that
despised
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
28
25
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
i
shall
have
gathered
the
house
of
israel
from
the
people
among
whom
they
are
scattered
and
shall
be
sanctified
in
them
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
then
shall
they
dwell
in
their
land
that
i
have
given
to
my
servant
jacob
28
26
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
therein
and

29
1
in
the
tenth
year
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
twelfth
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
29
2
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
prophesy
against
him
and
against
all
egypt
29
3
speak
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
thee
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
the
great
dragon
that
lieth
in
the
midst
of
his
rivers
which
hath
said
my
river
is
mine
own
and
i
have
made
it
for
myself
29
4
but
i
will
put
hooks
in
thy
jaws
and
i
will
cause
the
fish
of
thy
rivers
to
stick
unto
thy
scales
and
i
will
bring
thee
up
out
of
the
midst
of
thy
rivers
and
all
the
fish
of
thy
rivers
shall
stick
unto
thy
scales
29
5
and
i
will
leave
thee
thrown
into
the
wilderness
thee
and
all
the
fish
of
thy
rivers
thou
shalt
fall
upon
the
open
fields
thou
shalt
not
be
brought
together
nor
gathered
i
have
given
thee
for
meat
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
to
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
29
6
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
egypt
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
because
they
have
been
a
staff
of
reed
to
the
house
of
israel
29
7
when
they
took
hold
of
thee
by
thy
hand
thou
didst
break
and
rend
all
their
shoulder
and
when
they
leaned
upon
thee
thou
brakest
and
madest
all
their
loins
to
be
at
a
stand
29
8
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
bring
a
sword
upon
thee
and
cut
off
man
and
beast
out
of
thee
29
9
and
the
land
of
egypt
shall
be
desolate
and
waste
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
because
he
hath
said
the
river
is
mine
and
i
have
made
it
29
10
behold
therefore
i
am
against
thee
and
against
thy
rivers
and
i
will
make
the
land
of
egypt
utterly
waste
and
desolate
from
the
tower
of
syene
even
unto
the
border
of
ethiopia
29
11
no
foot
of
man
shall
pass
through
it
nor
foot
of
beast
shall
pass
through
it
neither
shall
it
be
inhabited
forty
years
29
12
and
i
will
make
the
land
of
egypt
desolate
in
the
midst
of
the
countries
that
are
desolate
and
her
cities
among
the
cities
that
are
laid
waste
shall
be
desolate
forty
years
and
i
will
scatter
the
egyptians
among
the
nations
and
will
disperse
them
through
the
countries
29
13
yet
thus
saith
the
lord
god
at
the
end
of
forty
years
will
i
gather
the
egyptians
from
the
people
whither
they
were
scattered
29
14
and
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
egypt
and
will
cause
them
to
return
into
the
land
of
pathros
into
the
land
of
their
habitation
and
they
shall
be
there
a
base
kingdom
29
15
it
shall
be
the
basest
of
the
kingdoms
neither
shall
it
exalt
itself
any
more
above
the
nations
for
i
will
diminish
them
that
they
shall
no
more
rule
over
the
nations
29
16
and
it
shall
be
no
more
the
confidence
of
the
house
of
israel
which
bringeth
their
iniquity
to
remembrance
when
they
shall
look
after
them
but
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
29
17
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seven
and
twentieth
year
in
the
first
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
29
18
son
of

nebuchadrezzar

of
babylon
caused
his
army
to
serve
a
great
service
against
tyrus
every
head
was
made
bald
and
every
shoulder
was
peeled
yet
had
he
no
wages
nor
his
army
for
tyrus
for
the
service
that
he
had
served
against
it
29
19
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
give
the
land
of
egypt
unto
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take
her
multitude
and
take
her
spoil
and
take
her
prey
and
it
shall
be
the
wages
for
his
army
29
20
i
have
given
him
the
land
of
egypt
for
his
labour
wherewith
he
served
against
it
because
they
wrought
for
me
saith
the
lord
god
29
21
in
that
day
will
i
cause
the
horn
of
the
house
of
israel
to
bud
forth
and
i
will
give
thee
the
opening
of
the
mouth
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
30
1
the
word
of
the

came
again
unto
me
saying
30

thus
saith

near
a
cloudy
day
it
shall
be
the
time
of
the
heathen
30
4
and
the
sword
shall
come
upon
egypt
and
great
pain
shall
be
in
ethiopia
when
the
slain
shall
fall
in
egypt
and
they
shall
take
away
her
multitude
and
her
foundations
shall
be
broken
down
30

ethiopia
and
libya
and
lydia
and
all
the
mingled
people
and
chub
and
the
men
of
the
land
that
is
in
league
shall
fall
with
them
by
the
sword
30

thus
saith
the
lord
they
also
that
uphold
egypt
shall
fall
and
the
pride
of
her
power
shall
come
down
from
the
tower
of
syene

they
fall
in
it
by
the
sword
saith
the
lord
god
30
7
and
they
shall
be
desolate
in
the
midst
of
the
countries
that
are
desolate
and
her
cities
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
the
cities
that
are
wasted
30
8
and
they
shall

30
13
thus

lord
god
i

18
at

be
darkened
when

shall
break
there
the
yokes
of

a
cloud

30
19
thus
will
i
execute
judgments
in
egypt
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
30
20
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
first
month
in
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
30
21
son
of
man
i
have
broken
the
arm
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
lo
it
shall
not
be
bound
up
to
be
healed
to
put
a
roller
to
bind
it
to
make
it
strong
to
hold
the
sword
30
22
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
will
break
his
arms
the
strong
and
that
which
was
broken
and
i
will
cause
the
sword
to
fall
out
of
his
hand
30
23
and
i
will
scatter
the
egyptians
among
the
nations
and
will
disperse
them
through
the
countries
30
24
and
i
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
put
my
sword
in
his
hand
but
i
will
break
pharaoh’s
arms
and
he
shall
groan
before
him
with
the
groanings
of
a
deadly
wounded
man
30
25
but
i
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
the
arms
of
pharaoh
shall
fall
down
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
put
my
sword
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
stretch
it
out
upon
the
land
of
egypt
30
26
and
i
will
scatter
the
egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
countries
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
31
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
third
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
31
2
son
of
man
speak
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
to
his
multitude
whom
art
thou
like
in
thy
greatness
31
3
behold
the
assyrian
was
a
cedar
in
lebanon
with
fair
branches
and
with
a
shadowing
shroud
and
of
an
high
stature
and
his
top
was
among
the
thick
boughs
31
4
the
waters
made
him
great
the
deep
set
him
up
on
high
with
her
rivers
running
round
about
his
plants
and
sent
her
little
rivers
unto
all
the
trees
of
the
field
31
5
therefore
his
height
was
exalted
above
all
the
trees
of
the
field
and
his
boughs
were
multiplied
and
his
branches
became
long
because
of
the
multitude
of
waters
when
he
shot
forth
31
6
all
the
fowls
of
heaven
made
their
nests
in
his
boughs
and
under
his
branches
did
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
bring
forth
their
young
and
under
his
shadow
dwelt
all
great
nations
31
7
thus
was
he
fair
in
his
greatness
in
the
length
of
his
branches
for
his
root
was
by
great
waters
31
8
the
cedars
in
the
garden
of
god
could
not
hide
him
the
fir
trees
were
not
like
his
boughs
and
the
chestnut
trees
were
not
like
his
branches
nor
any
tree
in
the
garden
of
god
was
like
unto
him
in
his
beauty
31
9
i
have
made
him
fair
by
the
multitude
of
his
branches
so
that
all
the
trees
of
eden
that
were
in
the
garden
of
god
envied
him
31
10
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
lifted
up
thyself
in
height
and
he
hath
shot
up
his
top
among
the
thick
boughs
and
his
heart
is
lifted
up
in
his
height
31
11
i
have
therefore
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
mighty
one
of
the
heathen
he
shall
surely
deal
with
him
i
have
driven
him
out
for
his
wickedness
31
12
and
strangers
the
terrible
of
the
nations
have
cut
him
off
and
have
left
him
upon
the
mountains
and
in
all
the
valleys
his
branches
are
fallen
and
his
boughs
are
broken
by
all
the
rivers
of
the
land
and
all
the
people
of
the
earth
are
gone
down
from
his
shadow
and
have
left
him
31
13
upon
his
ruin
shall
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
remain
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
upon
his
branches
31
14
to
the
end
that
none
of
all
the
trees
by
the
waters
exalt
themselves
for
their
height
neither
shoot
up
their
top
among
the
thick
boughs
neither
their
trees
stand
up
in
their
height
all
that
drink
water
for
they
are
all
delivered
unto
death
to
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
men
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
31
15
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
when
he
went
down
to
the
grave
i
caused
a
mourning
i
covered
the
deep
for
him
and
i
restrained
the
floods
thereof
and
the
great
waters
were
stayed
and
i
caused
lebanon
to
mourn
for
him
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
fainted
for
him
31
16
i
made
the
nations
to
shake
at
the
sound
of
his
fall
when
i
cast
him
down
to
hell
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit
and
all
the
trees
of
eden
the
choice
and
best
of
lebanon
all
that
drink
water
shall
be
comforted
in
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
31
17
they
also
went
down
into
hell
with
him
unto
them
that
be
slain
with
the
sword
and
they
that
were
his
arm
that
dwelt
under
his
shadow
in
the
midst
of
the
heathen
31
18
to
whom
art
thou
thus
like
in
glory
and
in
greatness
among
the
trees
of
eden
yet
shalt
thou
be
brought
down
with
the
trees
of
eden
unto
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword
this
is
pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude
saith
the
lord
god
32
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
in
the
twelfth
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
32
2
son
of
man
take
up
a
lamentation
for
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
say
unto
him
thou
art
like
a
young
lion
of
the
nations
and
thou
art
as
a
whale
in
the
seas
and
thou
camest
forth
with
thy
rivers
and
troubledst
the
waters
with
thy
feet
and
fouledst
their
rivers
32
3
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
therefore
spread
out
my
net
over
thee
with
a
company
of
many
people
and
they
shall
bring
thee
up
in
my
net
32
4
then
will
i
leave
thee
upon
the
land
i
will
cast
thee
forth
upon
the
open
field
and
will
cause
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
to
remain
upon
thee
and
i
will
fill
the
beasts
of
the
whole
earth
with
thee
32
5
and
i
will
lay
thy
flesh
upon
the
mountains
and
fill
the
valleys
with
thy
height
32
6
i
will
also
water
with
thy
blood
the
land
wherein
thou
swimmest
even
to
the
mountains
and
the
rivers
shall
be
full
of
thee
32
7
and
when
i
shall
put
thee
out
i
will
cover
the
heaven
and
make
the
stars
thereof
dark
i
will
cover
the
sun
with
a
cloud
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
32
8
all
the
bright
lights
of
heaven
will
i
make
dark
over
thee
and
set
darkness
upon
thy
land
saith
the
lord
god
32
9
i
will
also
vex
the
hearts
of
many
people
when
i
shall
bring
thy
destruction
among
the
nations
into
the
countries
which
thou
hast
not
known
32
10
yea
i
will
make
many
people
amazed
at
thee
and
their
kings
shall
be
horribly
afraid
for
thee
when
i
shall
brandish
my
sword
before
them
and
they
shall
tremble
at
every
moment
every
man
for
his
own
life
in
the
day
of
thy
fall
32
11
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
sword
of
the
king
of
babylon
shall
come
upon
thee
32
12
by
the
swords
of
the
mighty
will
i
cause
thy
multitude
to
fall
the
terrible
of
the
nations
all
of
them
and
they
shall
spoil
the
pomp
of
egypt
and
all
the
multitude
thereof
shall
be
destroyed
32
13
i
will
destroy
also
all
the
beasts
thereof
from
beside
the
great
waters
neither
shall
the
foot
of
man
trouble
them
any
more
nor
the
hoofs
of
beasts
trouble
them
32
14
then
will
i
make
their
waters
deep
and
cause
their
rivers
to
run
like
oil
saith
the
lord
god
32
15
when
i
shall
make
the
land
of
egypt
desolate
and
the
country
shall
be
destitute
of
that
whereof
it
was
full
when
i
shall
smite
all
them
that
dwell
therein
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
32
16
this
is
the
lamentation
wherewith
they
shall
lament
her
the
daughters
of
the
nations
shall
lament
her
they
shall
lament
for
her
even
for
egypt
and
for
all
her
multitude
saith
the
lord
god

again
the

speak

say
unto

when

take
a
man
of

if
when

come
upon

he
blow
the

33
4
then
whosoever

not
warning
if

him
away
his

33
5
he
heard
the

not
warning
his

he
that
taketh
warning
shall

but

the
watchman
see
the
sword
come
and
blow
not
the
trumpet
and
the
people
be
not
warned
if
the
sword
come
and
take
any
person
from
among
them
he
is
taken
away
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
the
watchman’s
hand
33
7
so
thou
o
son
of
man
i
have
set
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
israel
therefore
thou
shalt
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth
and
warn
them
from
me
33
8
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
o
wicked
man
thou
shalt
surely
die
if
thou
dost
not
speak
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
way
that
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
33
9
nevertheless
if
thou
warn
the
wicked
of
his
way
to
turn
from
it
if
he
do
not
turn
from
his
way
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
33
10
therefore
o
thou
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
ye
speak
saying
if
our
transgressions
and
our
sins
be
upon
us
and
we
pine
away
in
them
how
should
we
then
live
33
11
say
unto
them
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
the
wicked
but
that
the
wicked
turn
from
his
way
and
live
turn
ye
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
33
12
therefore
thou
son
of
man
say
unto
the
children
of
thy
people
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
not
deliver
him
in
the
day
of
his
transgression
as
for
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
he
shall
not
fall
thereby
in
the
day
that
he
turneth
from
his
wickedness
neither
shall
the
righteous
be
able
to
live
for
his
righteousness
in
the
day
that
he
sinneth
33
13
when
i
shall
say
to
the
righteous
that
he
shall
surely
live
if
he
trust
to
his
own
righteousness
and
commit
iniquity
all
his
righteousnesses
shall
not
be
remembered
but
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
committed
he
shall
die
for
it
33
14
again
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
thou
shalt
surely
die
if
he
turn
from
his
sin
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
33
15
if
the
wicked
restore
the
pledge
give
again
that
he
had
robbed
walk
in
the
statutes
of
life
without
committing
iniquity
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
33
16
none
of
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
shall
be
mentioned
unto
him
he
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
surely
live
33
17
yet
the
children
of
thy
people
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
but
as
for
them
their
way
is
not
equal
33
18
when
the
righteous
turneth
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
he
shall
even
die
thereby
33
19
but
if
the
wicked
turn
from
his
wickedness
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
live
thereby
33
20
yet
ye
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
o
ye
house
of
israel
i
will
judge
you
every
one
after
his
ways
33
21
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
of
our
captivity
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
that
one
that
had
escaped
out
of
jerusalem
came
unto
me
saying
the
city
is
smitten
33
22
now
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
upon
me
in
the
evening
afore
he
that
was
escaped
came
and
had
opened
my
mouth
until
he
came
to
me
in
the
morning
and
my
mouth
was
opened
and
i
was
no
more
dumb
33
23
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
33
24
son
of
man
they
that
inhabit
those
wastes
of
the
land
of
israel
speak
saying
abraham
was
one
and
he
inherited
the
land
but
we
are
many
the
land
is
given
us
for
inheritance
33
25
wherefore
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
ye
eat
with
the
blood
and
lift
up
your
eyes
toward
your
idols
and
shed
blood
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land
33
26
ye
stand
upon
your
sword
ye
work
abomination
and
ye
defile
every
one
his
neighbour’s
wife
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land
33
27
say
thou
thus
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
i
live
surely
they
that
are
in
the
wastes
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
him
that
is
in
the
open
field
will
i
give
to
the
beasts
to
be
devoured
and
they
that
be
in
the
forts
and
in
the
caves
shall
die
of
the
pestilence
33
28
for
i
will
lay
the
land
most
desolate
and
the
pomp
of
her
strength
shall
cease
and
the
mountains
of
israel
shall
be
desolate
that
none
shall
pass
through
33
29
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
laid
the
land
most
desolate
because
of
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
33
30
also
thou
son
of
man
the
children
of
thy
people
still
are
talking
against
thee
by
the
walls
and
in
the
doors
of
the
houses
and
speak
one
to
another
every
one
to
his
brother
saying
come
i
pray
you
and
hear
what
is
the
word
that
cometh
forth
from
the
lord
33
31
and
they
come
unto
thee
as
the
people
cometh
and
they
sit
before
thee
as
my
people
and
they
hear
thy
words
but
they
will
not
do
them
for
with
their
mouth
they
shew
much
love
but
their
heart
goeth
after
their
covetousness
33
32
and
lo
thou
art
unto
them
as
a
very
lovely
song
of
one
that
hath
a
pleasant
voice
and
can
play
well
on
an
instrument
for
they
hear
thy
words
but
they
do
them
not
33
33
and
when
this
cometh
to
pass
(lo
it
will
come
)
then
shall
they
know
that
a
prophet
hath
been
among
them
34
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
34
2
son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
of
israel
prophesy
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
the
shepherds
woe
be
to
the
shepherds
of
israel
that
do
feed
themselves
should
not
the
shepherds
feed
the
flocks
34
3
ye
eat
the
fat
and
ye
clothe
you
with
the
wool
ye
kill
them
that
are
fed
but
ye
feed
not
the
flock
34
4
the
diseased
have
ye
not
strengthened
neither
have
ye
healed
that
which
was
sick
neither
have
ye
bound
up
that
which
was
broken
neither
have
ye
brought
again
that
which
was
driven
away
neither
have
ye
sought
that
which
was
lost
but
with
force
and
with
cruelty
have
ye
ruled
them
34
5
and
they
were
scattered
because
there
is
no
shepherd
and
they
became
meat
to
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
when
they
were
scattered
34
6
my
sheep
wandered
through
all
the
mountains
and
upon
every
high
hill
yea
my
flock
was
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
none
did
search
or
seek
after
them
34
7
therefore
ye
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
34
8
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
because
my
flock
became
a
prey
and
my
flock
became
meat
to
every
beast
of
the
field
because
there
was
no
shepherd
neither
did
my
shepherds
search
for
my
flock
but
the
shepherds
fed
themselves
and
fed
not
my
flock
34
9
therefore
o
ye
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
34
10
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
the
shepherds
and
i
will
require
my
flock
at
their
hand
and
cause
them
to
cease
from
feeding
the
flock
neither
shall
the
shepherds
feed
themselves
any
more
for
i
will
deliver
my
flock
from
their
mouth
that
they
may
not
be
meat
for
them
34
11
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
even
i
will
both
search
my
sheep
and
seek
them
out
34
12
as
a
shepherd
seeketh
out
his
flock
in
the
day
that
he
is
among
his
sheep
that
are
scattered
so
will
i
seek
out
my
sheep
and
will
deliver
them
out
of
all
places
where
they
have
been
scattered
in
the
cloudy
and
dark
day
34
13
and
i
will
bring
them
out
from
the
people
and
gather
them
from
the
countries
and
will
bring
them
to
their
own
land
and
feed
them
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
by
the
rivers
and
in
all
the
inhabited
places
of
the
country
34
14
i
will
feed
them
in
a
good
pasture
and
upon
the
high
mountains
of
israel
shall
their
fold
be
there
shall
they
lie
in
a
good
fold
and
in
a
fat
pasture
shall
they
feed
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
34
15
i
will
feed
my
flock
and
i
will
cause
them
to
lie
down
saith
the
lord
god
34
16
i
will
seek
that
which
was
lost
and
bring
again
that
which
was
driven
away
and
will
bind
up
that
which
was
broken
and
will
strengthen
that
which
was
sick
but
i
will
destroy
the
fat
and
the
strong
i
will
feed
them
with
judgment
34
17
and
as
for
you
o
my
flock
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle
between
the
rams
and
the
he
goats
34
18
seemeth
it
a
small
thing
unto
you
to
have
eaten
up
the
good
pasture
but
ye
must
tread
down
with
your
feet
the
residue
of
your
pastures
and
to
have
drunk
of
the
deep
waters
but
ye
must
foul
the
residue
with
your
feet
34
19
and
as
for
my
flock
they
eat
that
which
ye
have
trodden
with
your
feet
and
they
drink
that
which
ye
have
fouled
with
your
feet
34
20
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
them
behold
i
even
i
will
judge
between
the
fat
cattle
and
between
the
lean
cattle
34
21
because
ye
have
thrust
with
side
and
with
shoulder
and
pushed
all
the
diseased
with
your
horns
till
ye
have
scattered
them
abroad
34
22
therefore
will
i
save
my
flock
and
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey
and
i
will
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle
34
23
and
i
will
set
up
one
shepherd
over
them
and
he
shall
feed
them
even
my
servant
david
he
shall
feed
them
and
he
shall
be
their
shepherd
34
24
and
i
the
lord
will
be
their
god
and
my
servant
david
a
prince
among
them
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
34
25
and
i
will
make
with
them
a
covenant
of
peace
and
will
cause
the
evil
beasts
to
cease
out
of
the
land
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
wilderness
and
sleep
in
the
woods
34
26
and
i
will
make
them
and
the
places
round
about
my
hill
a
blessing
and
i
will
cause
the
shower
to
come
down
in
his
season
there
shall
be
showers
of
blessing
34
27
and
the
tree
of
the
field
shall
yield
her
fruit
and
the
earth
shall
yield
her
increase
and
they
shall
be
safe
in
their
land
and
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
broken
the
bands
of
their
yoke
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
served
themselves
of
them
34
28
and
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey
to
the
heathen
neither
shall
the
beast
of
the
land
devour
them
but
they
shall
dwell
safely
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
34
29
and
i
will
raise
up
for
them
a
plant
of
renown
and
they
shall
be
no
more
consumed
with
hunger
in
the
land
neither
bear
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more
34
30
thus
shall
they
know
that
i
the
lord
their
god
am
with
them
and
that
they
even
the
house
of
israel
are
my
people
saith
the
lord
god
34
31
and
ye
my
flock
the
flock
of
my
pasture
are
men
and
i
am
your
god
saith
the
lord
god
35
1
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
35
2
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
mount
seir
and
prophesy
against
it
35
3
and
say
unto
it
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
o
mount
seir
i
am
against
thee
and
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
against
thee
and
i
will
make
thee
most
desolate
35
4
i
will
lay
thy
cities
waste
and
thou
shalt
be
desolate
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
35
5
because
thou
hast
had
a
perpetual
hatred
and
hast
shed
the
blood
of
the
children
of
israel
by
the
force
of
the
sword
in
the
time
of
their
calamity
in
the
time
that
their
iniquity
had
an
end
35
6
therefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
prepare
thee
unto
blood
and
blood
shall
pursue
thee
sith
thou
hast
not
hated
blood
even
blood
shall
pursue
thee
35
7
thus
will
i
make
mount
seir
most
desolate
and
cut
off
from
it
him
that
passeth
out
and
him
that
returneth
35
8
and
i
will
fill
his
mountains
with
his
slain
men
in
thy
hills
and
in
thy
valleys
and
in
all
thy
rivers
shall
they
fall
that
are
slain
with
the
sword
35
9
i
will
make
thee
perpetual
desolations
and
thy
cities
shall
not
return
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
35
10
because
thou
hast
said
these
two
nations
and
these
two
countries
shall
be
mine
and
we
will
possess
it
whereas
the
lord
was
there
35
11
therefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
do
according
to
thine
anger
and
according
to
thine
envy
which
thou
hast
used
out
of
thy
hatred
against
them
and
i
will
make
myself
known
among
them
when
i
have
judged
thee
35
12
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
that
i
have
heard
all
thy
blasphemies
which
thou
hast
spoken
against
the
mountains
of
israel
saying
they
are
laid
desolate
they
are
given
us
to
consume
35
13
thus
with
your
mouth
ye
have
boasted
against
me
and
have
multiplied
your
words
against
me
i
have
heard
them
35
14
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
whole
earth
rejoiceth
i
will
make
thee
desolate
35
15
as
thou
didst
rejoice
at
the
inheritance
of
the
house
of
israel
because
it
was
desolate
so
will
i
do
unto
thee
thou
shalt
be
desolate
o
mount
seir
and
all
idumea
even
all
of
it
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
36
1
also
thou
son
of
man
prophesy
unto
the
mountains
of
israel
and
say
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
36
2
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
the
enemy
hath
said
against
you
aha
even
the
ancient
high
places
are
ours
in
possession
36
3
therefore
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
they
have
made
you
desolate
and
swallowed
you
up
on
every
side
that
ye
might
be
a
possession
unto
the
residue
of
the
heathen
and
ye
are
taken
up
in
the
lips
of
talkers
and
are
an
infamy
of
the
people
36
4
therefore
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
valleys
to
the
desolate
wastes
and
to
the
cities
that
are
forsaken
which
became
a
prey
and
derision
to
the
residue
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
surely
in
the
fire
of
my
jealousy
have
i
spoken
against
the
residue
of
the
heathen
and
against
all
idumea
which
have
appointed
my
land
into
their
possession
with
the
joy
of
all
their
heart
with
despiteful
minds
to
cast
it
out
for
a
prey
36
6
prophesy
therefore
concerning
the
land
of
israel
and
say
unto
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
valleys
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
have
spoken
in
my
jealousy
and
in
my
fury
because
ye
have
borne
the
shame
of
the
heathen
36
7
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
have
lifted
up
mine
hand
surely
the
heathen
that
are
about
you
they
shall
bear
their
shame
36
8
but
ye
o
mountains
of
israel
ye
shall
shoot
forth
your
branches
and
yield
your
fruit
to
my
people
of
israel
for
they
are
at
hand
to
come
36
9
for
behold
i
am
for
you
and
i
will
turn
unto
you
and
ye
shall
be
tilled
and
sown
36
10
and
i
will
multiply
men
upon
you
all
the
house
of
israel
even
all
of
it
and
the
cities
shall
be
inhabited
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded
36
11
and
i
will
multiply
upon
you
man
and
beast
and
they
shall
increase
and
bring
fruit
and
i
will
settle
you
after
your
old
estates
and
will
do
better
unto
you
than
at
your
beginnings
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
36
12
yea
i
will
cause
men
to
walk
upon
you
even
my
people
israel
and
they
shall
possess
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
their
inheritance
and
thou
shalt
no
more
henceforth
bereave
them
of
men
36
13
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
they
say
unto
you
thou
land
devourest
up
men
and
hast
bereaved
thy
nations
36
14
therefore
thou
shalt
devour
men
no
more
neither
bereave
thy
nations
any
more
saith
the
lord
god
36
15
neither
will
i
cause
men
to
hear
in
thee
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more
neither
shalt
thou
bear
the
reproach
of
the
people
any
more
neither
shalt
thou
cause
thy
nations
to
fall
any
more
saith
the
lord
god
36
16
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
36
17
son
of
man
when
the
house
of
israel
dwelt
in
their
own
land
they
defiled
it
by
their
own
way
and
by
their
doings
their
way
was
before
me
as
the
uncleanness
of
a
removed
woman
36
18
wherefore
i
poured
my
fury
upon
them
for
the
blood
that
they
had
shed
upon
the
land
and
for
their
idols
wherewith
they
had
polluted
it
36
19
and
i
scattered
them
among
the
heathen
and
they
were
dispersed
through
the
countries
according
to
their
way
and
according
to
their
doings
i
judged
them
36
20
and
when
they
entered
unto
the
heathen
whither
they
went
they
profaned
my
holy
name
when
they
said
to
them
these
are
the
people
of
the
lord
and
are
gone
forth
out
of
his
land
36
21
but
i
had
pity
for
mine
holy
name
which
the
house
of
israel
had
profaned
among
the
heathen
whither
they
went
36
22
therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
do
not
this
for
your
sakes
o
house
of
israel
but
for
mine
holy
name’s
sake
which
ye
have
profaned
among
the
heathen
whither
ye
went
36
23
and
i
will
sanctify
my
great
name
which
was
profaned
among
the
heathen
which
ye
have
profaned
in
the
midst
of
them
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
saith
the
lord
god
when
i
shall
be
sanctified
in
you
before
their
eyes
36
24
for
i
will
take
you
from
among
the
heathen
and
gather
you
out
of
all
countries
and
will
bring
you
into
your
own
land
36
25
then
will
i
sprinkle
clean
water
upon
you
and
ye
shall
be
clean
from
all
your
filthiness
and
from
all
your
idols
will
i
cleanse
you
36
26
a
new
heart
also
will
i
give
you
and
a
new
spirit
will
i
put
within
you
and
i
will
take
away
the
stony
heart
out
of
your
flesh
and
i
will
give
you
an
heart
of
flesh
36
27
and
i
will
put
my
spirit
within
you
and
cause
you
to
walk
in
my
statutes
and
ye
shall
keep
my
judgments
and
do
them
36
28
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
that
i
gave
to
your
fathers
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
36
29
i
will
also
save
you
from
all
your
uncleannesses
and
i
will
call
for
the
corn
and
will
increase
it
and
lay
no
famine
upon
you
36
30
and
i
will
multiply
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
the
increase
of
the
field
that
ye
shall
receive
no
more
reproach
of
famine
among
the
heathen
36
31
then
shall
ye
remember
your
own
evil
ways
and
your
doings
that
were
not
good
and
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
your
iniquities
and
for
your
abominations
36
32
not
for
your
sakes
do
i
this
saith
the
lord
god
be
it
known
unto
you
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
your
own
ways
o
house
of
israel
36
33
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
that
i
shall
have
cleansed
you
from
all
your
iniquities
i
will
also
cause
you
to
dwell
in
the
cities
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded
36
34
and
the
desolate
land
shall
be
tilled
whereas
it
lay
desolate
in
the
sight
of
all
that
passed
by
36
35
and
they
shall
say
this
land
that
was
desolate
is
become
like
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
waste
and
desolate
and
ruined
cities
are
become
fenced
and
are
inhabited
36
36
then
the
heathen
that
are
left
round
about
you
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
build
the
ruined
places
and
plant
that
that
was
desolate
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
i
will
do
it
36
37
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
yet
for
this
be
enquired
of
by
the
house
of
israel
to
do
it
for
them
i
will
increase
them
with
men
like
a
flock
36
38
as
the
holy
flock
as
the
flock
of
jerusalem
in
her
solemn
feasts
so
shall
the
waste
cities
be
filled
with
flocks
of
men
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
37
1
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
upon
me
and
carried
me
out
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
set
me
down
in
the
midst
of
the
valley
which
was
full
of
bones
37
2
and
caused
me
to
pass
by
them
round
about
and
behold
there
were
very
many
in
the
open
valley
and
lo
they
were
very
dry
37
3
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
can
these
bones
live
and
i
answered
o
lord
god
thou
knowest
37
4
again
he
said
unto
me
prophesy
upon
these
bones
and
say
unto
them
o
ye
dry
bones
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
37
5
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
these
bones
behold
i
will
cause
breath
to
enter
into
you
and
ye
shall
live
37
6
and
i
will
lay
sinews
upon
you
and
will
bring
up
flesh
upon
you
and
cover
you
with
skin
and
put
breath
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
37
7
so
i
prophesied
as
i
was
commanded
and
as
i
prophesied
there
was
a
noise
and
behold
a
shaking
and
the
bones
came
together
bone
to
his
bone
37
8
and
when
i
beheld
lo
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
came
up
upon
them
and
the
skin
covered
them
above
but
there
was
no
breath
in
them
37
9
then
said
he
unto
me
prophesy
unto
the
wind
prophesy
son
of
man
and
say
to
the
wind
thus
saith
the
lord
god
come
from
the
four
winds
o
breath
and
breathe
upon
these
slain
that
they
may
live
37
10
so
i
prophesied
as
he
commanded
me
and
the
breath
came
into
them
and
they
lived
and
stood
up
upon
their
feet
an
exceeding
great
army
37
11
then
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
these
bones
are
the
whole
house
of
israel
behold
they
say
our
bones
are
dried
and
our
hope
is
lost
we
are
cut
off
for
our
parts
37
12
therefore
prophesy
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
o
my
people
i
will
open
your
graves
and
cause
you
to
come
up
out
of
your
graves
and
bring
you
into
the
land
of
israel
37
13
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
opened
your
graves
o
my
people
and
brought
you
up
out
of
your
graves
37
14
and
shall
put
my
spirit
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
i
shall
place
you
in
your
own
land
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
performed
it
saith
the
lord
37
15
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
37
16
moreover
thou
son
of
man
take
thee
one
stick
and
write
upon
it
for
judah
and
for
the
children
of
israel
his
companions
then
take
another
stick
and
write
upon
it
for
joseph
the
stick
of
ephraim
and
for
all
the
house
of
israel
his
companions
37
17
and
join
them
one
to
another
into
one
stick
and
they
shall
become
one
in
thine
hand
37
18
and
when
the
children
of
thy
people
shall
speak
unto
thee
saying
wilt
thou
not
shew
us
what
thou
meanest
by
these
37
19
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
take
the
stick
of
joseph
which
is
in
the
hand
of
ephraim
and
the
tribes
of
israel
his
fellows
and
will
put
them
with
him
even
with
the
stick
of
judah
and
make
them
one
stick
and
they
shall
be
one
in
mine
hand
37
20
and
the
sticks
whereon
thou
writest
shall
be
in
thine
hand
before
their
eyes
37
21
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
take
the
children
of
israel
from
among
the
heathen
whither
they
be
gone
and
will
gather
them
on
every
side
and
bring
them
into
their
own
land
37
22
and
i
will
make
them
one
nation
in
the
land
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
and
one
king
shall
be
king
to
them
all
and
they
shall
be
no
more
two
nations
neither
shall
they
be
divided
into
two
kingdoms
any
more
at
all
37
23
neither
shall
they
defile
themselves
any
more
with
their
idols
nor
with
their
detestable
things
nor
with
any
of
their
transgressions
but
i
will
save
them
out
of
all
their
dwellingplaces
wherein
they
have
sinned
and
will
cleanse
them
so
shall
they
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
37
24
and
david
my
servant
shall
be
king
over
them
and
they
all
shall
have
one
shepherd
they
shall
also
walk
in
my
judgments
and
observe
my
statutes
and
do
them
37
25
and
they
shall
dwell
in
the
land
that
i
have
given
unto
jacob
my
servant
wherein
your
fathers
have
dwelt
and
they
shall
dwell
therein
even
they
and
their
children
and
their
children’s
children
for
ever
and
my
servant
david
shall
be
their
prince
for
ever
37
26
moreover
i
will
make
a
covenant
of
peace
with
them
it
shall
be
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them
and
i
will
place
them
and
multiply
them
and
will
set
my
sanctuary
in
the
midst
of
them
for
evermore
37
27
my
tabernacle
also
shall
be
with
them
yea
i
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
37
28
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
do
sanctify
israel
when
my
sanctuary
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
them
for
evermore
38
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
38
2

of
man
set
thy
face
against
gog
the
land
of

the
chief
prince
of

38
3
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against

o

the
chief
prince
of
meshech
and
tubal
38
4
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
and
put
hooks
into
thy
jaws
and
i
will
bring
thee
forth
and
all
thine
army

38
7
be
thou
prepared
and

for
thyself
thou
and
all
thy
company
that
are
assembled
unto
thee
and
be
thou
a
guard
unto
them
38
8
after
many
days
thou
shalt
be
visited
in
the
latter
years
thou
shalt
come
into
the
land
that
is
brought
back
from
the
sword
and
is
gathered
out
of
many
people
against
the
mountains
of
israel
which
have
been
always
waste
but
it
is
brought
forth
out
of
the
nations
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
all
of
them
38
9
thou
shalt
ascend
and
come
like
a
storm
thou
shalt
be
like
a
cloud
to
cover
the
land
thou
and
all
thy
bands
and

people
with

38
10
thus
saith
the
lord
god
it
shall
also
come
to
pass
that
at
the
same
time
shall
things
come
into
thy
mind
and
thou
shalt
think
an
evil
thought
38
11
and
thou
shalt
say
i
will
go
up
to
the
land
of
unwalled
villages
i
will
go
to
them
that
are
at
rest
that

38
12
to
take
a
spoil
and
to
take
a
prey
to
turn
thine
hand
upon
the
desolate
places
that
are
now
inhabited
and
upon
the
people
that
are
gathered
out
of
the
nations
which
have
gotten
cattle
and
goods
that

in
the
midst
of
the
land
38
13
sheba
and
dedan
and
the
merchants
of
tarshish
with
all
the
young
lions
thereof
shall

unto
thee

to
carry
away
silver
and
gold
to
take
away
cattle
and

to
take
a
great
spoil
38
14
therefore
son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
unto
gog
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
that
day
when
my
people
of
israel
dwelleth
safely
shalt
thou
not

it
38
15
and
thou
shalt
come
from
thy
place
out
of
the
north
parts
thou
and
many
people
with
thee
all
of
them
riding
upon
horses
a
great
company
and
a
mighty
army
38
16
and
thou
shalt
come
up
against
my
people
of
israel
as
a
cloud
to
cover
the
land
it
shall
be
in
the
latter
days
and
i
will
bring
thee
against
my
land
that
the
heathen
may
know
me
when
i
shall
be
sanctified
in
thee
o
gog
before
their
eyes
38
17
thus
saith
the
lord
god
art
thou
he
of
whom
i
have
spoken
in
old
time
by
my
servants
the
prophets
of
israel
which
prophesied
in
those
days

saith

assemble

ye

39
20
thus
ye
shall
be
filled
at

with
horses
and
chariots
with
mighty
men
and
with
all
men
of

saith
the
lord
god
39
21
and
i
will
set
my
glory
among
the
heathen
and
all
the
heathen
shall
see
my
judgment
that
i
have
executed
and
my
hand
that
i
have
laid
upon
them
39
22
so
the
house
of
israel
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god
from
that
day
and
forward
39
23
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
the
house
of
israel
went
into
captivity
for
their
iniquity
because
they
trespassed
against
me
therefore
hid
i
my
face
from
them
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
so
fell
they
all
by
the
sword
39
24
according
to
their
uncleanness
and
according
to
their
transgressions
have
i
done
unto
them
and
hid
my
face
from
them
39
25
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
now
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
jacob
and
have
mercy
upon
the
whole
house
of
israel
and
will
be
jealous
for
my
holy
name
39
26
after
that
they
have
borne
their
shame
and
all
their
trespasses
whereby
they
have
trespassed
against
me
when
they
dwelt
safely
in
their
land
and
none
made
them
afraid
39
27
when
i
have
brought
them
again
from
the
people
and
gathered
them
out
of
their
enemies’
lands
and
am
sanctified
in
them
in
the
sight
of
many
nations
39
28
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god
which
caused
them
to
be
led
into
captivity
among
the
heathen
but
i
have
gathered
them
unto
their
own
land
and
have
left
none
of
them
any
more
there
39
29
neither
will
i
hide
my
face
any
more
from
them
for
i
have
poured
out
my
spirit
upon
the
house
of
israel

and
without
the
inner

were
the
chambers
of
the
singers
in
the
inner
court
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
north
gate
and
their
prospect
was
toward
the
south
one
at
the
side
of
the
east
gate
having
the
prospect
toward
the
north
40
45
and
he
said
unto
me
this
chamber
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
south
is
for
the
priests
the
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the

40
46
and
the

these
are
the

of
zadok
among
the
sons
of
levi
which
come
near
to
the
lord
to
minister
unto
him
40
47
so
he
measured
the
court
an
hundred
cubits
long
and
an
hundred
cubits
broad
foursquare
and
the
altar
that
was
before
the
house
40
48
and
he
brought
me
to
the
porch
of
the
house
and
measured
each
post
of
the
porch
five
cubits
on
this
side
and
five

on
that
side
and
the
breadth
of
the

was
three
cubits
on
this

and
three

on
that
side
40
49
the
length
of
the
porch
was
twenty
cubits
and
the
breadth
eleven
cubits
and
he
brought
me
by
the
steps
whereby
they
went
up
to
it
and
there
were
pillars
by
the
posts
one
on
this
side
and
another
on
that
side
41
1
afterward
he
brought
me
to
the
temple
and
measured
the
posts
six
cubits
broad
on
the
one
side
and
six
cubits
broad
on
the
other
side
which
was
the
breadth
of
the
tabernacle
41
2
and
the
breadth
of
the
door
was
ten
cubits
and
the
sides
of
the
door
were
five
cubits
on
the
one
side
and
five
cubits
on
the
other
side
and
he
measured
the
length
thereof
forty
cubits
and
the
breadth
twenty
cubits
41
3
then
went
he
inward
and
measured
the
post
of
the
door
two
cubits
and
the

six
cubits
and
the
breadth
of
the

seven
cubits
41
4
so
he
measured
the
length
thereof
twenty
cubits
and
the
breadth
twenty
cubits
before
the
temple
and
he
said
unto
me
this
is
the
most
holy
place
41
5
after
he
measured
the
wall
of
the
house
six
cubits
and
the
breadth
of
every
side
chamber
four
cubits
round
about
the
house
on
every
side
41
6
and
the
side
chambers
were
three
one
over
another
and
thirty
in
order
and
they
entered
into
the
wall
which
was
of
the
house
for
the
side
chambers
round
about
that
they
might
have
hold
but
they
had
not
hold
in
the
wall
of
the
house
41
7
and
there
was
an
enlarging
and
a
winding
about
still
upward
to
the
side
chambers
for
the
winding
about
of
the
house
went
still
upward
round
about
the
house
therefore
the
breadth
of
the
house
was
still
upward
and
so
increased
from
the
lowest
chamber
to
the
highest
by
the
midst
41
8
i
saw
also
the
height
of
the
house
round
about
the
foundations
of
the
side
chambers
were
a
full
reed
of
six
great
cubits
41
9
the
thickness
of
the
wall
which
was
for
the
side
chamber
without
was
five
cubits
and
that
which
was
left
was
the
place
of
the
side
chambers
that
were
within
41
10
and
between
the
chambers
was
the
wideness
of
twenty
cubits
round
about
the
house
on
every
side
41
11
and
the
doors
of
the
side
chambers
were
toward
the
place
that
was
left
one
door
toward
the
north
and
another
door
toward
the
south
and
the
breadth
of
the
place
that
was
left
was
five
cubits
round
about
41
12
now
the
building
that
was
before
the
separate
place
at
the
end
toward
the
west
was
seventy
cubits
broad
and
the
wall
of
the
building
was
five
cubits
thick
round
about
and
the
length
thereof
ninety
cubits
41
13
so
he
measured
the
house
an
hundred
cubits
long
and
the
separate
place
and
the
building
with
the
walls
thereof
an
hundred
cubits
long
41
14
also
the
breadth
of
the
face
of
the
house
and
of
the
separate
place
toward
the
east
an
hundred
cubits
41
15
and
he
measured
the
length
of
the
building
over
against
the
separate
place
which
was
behind
it
and
the
galleries
thereof
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
an
hundred
cubits
with
the
inner
temple
and
the
porches
of
the
court
41
16
the
door
posts
and
the
narrow
windows
and
the
galleries
round
about
on
their
three
stories
over
against
the
door
cieled
with
wood
round
about
and
from
the
ground
up
to
the
windows
and
the
windows
were
covered
41
17
to
that
above
the
door
even
unto
the
inner
house
and
without
and
by
all
the
wall
round
about
within
and
without
by
measure
41
18
and
it
was
made
with
cherubims
and
palm
trees
so
that
a
palm
tree
was
between
a
cherub
and
a
cherub
and
every
cherub
had
two
faces
41
19
so
that
the
face
of
a
man
was
toward
the
palm
tree
on
the
one
side
and
the
face
of
a
young
lion
toward
the
palm
tree
on
the
other
side
it
was
made
through
all
the
house
round
about
41
20
from
the
ground
unto
above
the
door
were
cherubims
and
palm
trees
made
and
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
41
21
the
posts
of
the
temple
were
squared
and
the
face
of
the
sanctuary
the
appearance
of
the
one
as
the
appearance
of
the
other
41
22
the
altar
of
wood
was
three
cubits
high
and
the
length
thereof
two
cubits
and
the
corners
thereof
and
the
length
thereof
and
the
walls
thereof
were
of
wood
and
he
said
unto
me
this
is
the
table
that
is
before
the
lord
41
23
and
the
temple
and
the
sanctuary
had
two
doors
41
24
and
the
doors
had
two
leaves
apiece
two
turning
leaves
two
leaves
for
the
one
door
and
two
leaves
for
the
other
door
41
25
and
there
were
made
on
them
on
the
doors
of
the
temple
cherubims
and
palm
trees
like
as
were
made
upon
the
walls
and
there
were
thick
planks
upon
the
face
of
the
porch
without
41
26
and
there
were
narrow
windows
and
palm
trees
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
on
the
sides
of
the
porch
and
upon
the
side
chambers
of
the
house
and
thick
planks
42
1
then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court
the
way
toward
the
north
and
he
brought
me
into
the
chamber
that
was
over
against
the
separate
place
and
which
was
before
the
building
toward
the
north
42
2
before
the
length
of
an
hundred
cubits
was
the
north
door
and
the
breadth
was
fifty
cubits
42
3
over
against
the
twenty
cubits
which
were
for
the
inner
court
and
over
against
the
pavement
which
was
for
the
utter
court
was
gallery
against
gallery
in
three
stories
42
4
and
before
the
chambers
was
a
walk
to
ten
cubits
breadth
inward
a
way
of
one
cubit
and
their
doors
toward
the
north
42
5
now
the
upper
chambers
were
shorter
for
the
galleries
were
higher
than
these
than
the
lower
and
than
the
middlemost
of
the
building
42
6
for
they
were
in
three
stories
but
had
not
pillars
as
the
pillars
of
the
courts
therefore
the
building
was
straitened
more
than
the
lowest
and
the
middlemost
from
the
ground
42
7
and
the
wall
that
was
without
over
against
the
chambers
toward
the
utter
court
on
the
forepart
of
the
chambers
the
length
thereof
was
fifty
cubits
42
8
for
the
length
of
the
chambers
that
were
in
the
utter
court
was
fifty
cubits
and
lo
before
the
temple
were
an
hundred
cubits
42
9
and
from
under
these
chambers
was
the
entry
on
the
east
side
as
one
goeth
into
them
from
the
utter
court
42
10
the
chambers
were
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
of
the
court
toward
the
east
over
against
the
separate
place
and
over
against
the
building
42
11
and
the
way
before
them
was
like
the
appearance
of
the
chambers
which
were
toward
the
north
as
long
as
they
and
as
broad
as
they
and
all
their
goings
out
were
both
according
to
their
fashions
and
according
to
their
doors
42
12
and
according
to
the
doors
of
the
chambers
that
were
toward
the
south
was
a
door
in
the
head
of
the
way
even
the
way
directly
before
the
wall
toward
the
east
as
one
entereth
into
them
42
13
then
said
he
unto
me
the
north
chambers
and
the
south
chambers
which
are
before
the
separate
place
they
be
holy
chambers
where
the
priests
that
approach
unto
the
lord
shall
eat
the
most
holy
things
there
shall
they
lay
the
most
holy
things
and
the
meat
offering
and
the
sin
offering
and
the
trespass
offering
for
the
place
is
holy
42
14
when
the
priests
enter
therein
then
shall
they
not
go
out
of
the
holy
place
into
the
utter
court
but
there
they
shall
lay
their
garments
wherein
they
minister
for
they
are
holy
and
shall
put
on
other
garments
and
shall
approach
to
those
things
which
are
for
the
people
42
15
now
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
measuring
the
inner
house
he
brought
me
forth
toward
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east
and
measured
it
round
about
42
16
he
measured
the
east
side
with
the
measuring
reed
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
round
about
42
17
he
measured
the
north
side
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
round
about
42
18
he
measured
the
south
side
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
42
19
he
turned
about
to
the
west
side
and
measured
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
42
20
he
measured
it
by
the
four
sides
it
had
a
wall
round
about
five
hundred
reeds
long
and
five
hundred
broad
to
make
a
separation
between
the
sanctuary
and
the
profane
place
43
1
afterward
he
brought
me
to
the
gate
even
the
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
east
43
2
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
came
from
the
way
of
the
east
and
his
voice
was
like
a
noise
of
many
waters
and
the
earth
shined
with
his
glory
43
3
and
it
was
according
to
the
appearance
of
the
vision
which
i
saw
even
according
to
the
vision
that
i
saw
when
i
came
to
destroy
the
city
and
the
visions
were
like
the
vision
that
i
saw
by
the
river
chebar
and
i
fell
upon
my
face
43
4
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
came
into
the
house
by
the
way
of
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east
43
5
so
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
house
43
6
and
i
heard
him
speaking
unto
me
out
of
the
house
and
the
man
stood
by
me
43
7
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
the
place
of
my
throne
and
the
place
of
the
soles
of
my
feet
where
i
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
israel
for
ever
and
my
holy
name
shall
the
house
of
israel
no
more
defile
neither
they
nor
their
kings
by
their
whoredom
nor
by
the
carcases
of
their
kings
in
their
high
places
43
8
in
their
setting
of
their
threshold
by
my
thresholds
and
their
post
by
my
posts
and
the
wall
between
me
and
them
they
have
even
defiled
my
holy
name
by
their
abominations
that
they
have
committed
wherefore
i
have
consumed
them
in
mine
anger
43
9
now
let
them
put
away
their
whoredom
and
the
carcases
of
their
kings
far
from
me
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
them
for
ever
43
10
thou
son
of
man
shew
the
house
to
the
house
of
israel
that
they
may
be
ashamed
of
their
iniquities
and
let
them
measure
the
pattern
43
11
and
if
they
be
ashamed
of
all
that
they
have
done
shew
them
the
form
of
the
house
and
the
fashion
thereof
and
the

12
this
is
the

43
13
and

then
he
brought
me
back

way
of
the
gate
of
the
outward
sanctuary
which
looketh
toward
the
east
and
it
was
shut
44

then
said
the
lord
unto
me
this
gate
shall
be
shut
it
shall
not
be
opened
and
no
man
shall
enter
in
by
it
because
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
hath
entered
in
by
it
therefore
it
shall
be
shut
44
3
it
is
for
the
prince
the
prince
he
shall
sit
in
it
to
eat
bread
before
the
lord
he
shall
enter
by
the
way
of
the
porch
of
that
gate
and
shall
go
out
by
the
way
of
the
same
44

then
brought
he
me
the
way
of
the
north
gate
before
the
house
and
i
looked
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
and
i
fell
upon
my
face
44
5
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
son
of
man
mark
well
and
behold
with
thine
eyes
and
hear
with
thine
ears
all
that
i
say
unto
thee
concerning
all
the
ordinances
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
laws
thereof
and
mark
well
the
entering
in
of
the
house
with
every
going
forth
of
the
sanctuary
44
6
and
thou
shalt
say
to
the
rebellious
even
to
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
o
ye
house
of
israel
let
it
suffice
you
of
all
your
abominations
44
7
in
that
ye
have
brought
into
my
sanctuary
strangers
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
uncircumcised
in
flesh
to
be
in
my
sanctuary
to
pollute
it
even
my
house
when
ye
offer
my
bread
the
fat
and
the
blood
and
they
have
broken
my
covenant
because
of
all
your
abominations
44
8
and
ye
have
not
kept
the
charge
of
mine
holy
things
but
ye
have
set
keepers
of
my
charge
in
my
sanctuary
for
yourselves
44
9
thus
saith
the
lord
god
no
stranger
uncircumcised
in
heart
nor
uncircumcised
in
flesh
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary
of
any
stranger
that
is
among
the
children
of
israel
44
10
and
the
levites
that
are
gone
away
far
from
me
when
israel
went
astray
which

astray
away
from
me
after
their
idols
they
shall
even
bear
their
iniquity

offering
and
the
sacrifice
for
the
people
and
they
shall
stand
before
them
to
minister
unto
them
44
12
because
they
ministered
unto
them
before
their
idols
and
caused
the
house
of
israel
to
fall
into
iniquity
therefore
have
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
against
them
saith
the
lord
god
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
44
13
and
they
shall
not
come
near
unto
me
to
do
the
office
of
a
priest
unto
me
nor
to
come
near
to
any
of
my
holy
things
in
the
most
holy
place
but
they
shall
bear
their
shame
and
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
44
14
but
i
will
make
them
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
house
for
all
the
service
thereof
and
for
all
that
shall
be
done
therein
44
15
but
the
priests
the
levites
the
sons
of
zadok
that
kept
the
charge
of
my
sanctuary
when
the
children
of
israel
went
astray
from
me
they
shall
come
near
to
me
to

me
to
offer
unto
me
the
fat
and
the
blood
saith

lord
god
44
16
they
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary
and
they
shall
come
near
to
my
table
to
minister
unto
me
and
they
shall
keep
my
charge
44
17
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when

court
to
the
people
they
shall
put
off
their
garments
wherein
they
ministered
and
lay
them
in
the
holy
chambers
and
they
shall
put
on
other

and
they
shall
not
sanctify
the

44
20
neither

they
shave
their

nor
suffer
their

and
they
shall
teach
my
people
the
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane
and
cause
them
to
discern
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean
44
24
and
in
controversy
they
shall
stand
in
judgment
and
they
shall
judge
it
according
to
my
judgments
and
they
shall
keep
my
laws

46
13
thou
shalt
daily
prepare
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
of
a
lamb
of
the
first
year
without
blemish
thou
shalt
prepare
it
every

46
14
and
thou
shalt
prepare
a

offering
for

every

the
sixth
part

to
temper
with
the
fine

a
meat
offering
continually
by
a
perpetual
ordinance
unto
the

46
15
thus
shall
they
prepare
the
lamb
and
the
meat
offering
and
the
oil
every
morning
for
a
continual
burnt
offering
46
16
thus
saith
the
lord
god
if
the
prince
give
a
gift
unto
any
of
his
sons
the
inheritance
thereof
shall
be
his
sons’
it
shall
be
their
possession
by
inheritance
46
17
but
if
he
give
a
gift
of
his
inheritance
to
one
of
his
servants
then
it
shall
be
his
to
the
year
of
liberty
after
it
shall
return
to
the
prince
but
his
inheritance
shall
be
his
sons’
for
them
46
18
moreover
the
prince
shall
not
take
of
the
people’s
inheritance
by
oppression
to
thrust
them
out
of
their
possession
but
he
shall
give
his
sons
inheritance
out
of
his
own
possession
that
my
people
be
not
scattered
every
man
from
his
possession
46
19
after
he
brought
me
through
the
entry
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
gate
into
the
holy
chambers
of
the
priests
which
looked
toward
the
north
and
behold
there
was
a
place
on
the
two
sides
westward
46
20
then
said
he
unto
me
this
is
the
place
where
the
priests
shall
boil
the
trespass
offering
and
the
sin
offering
where
they
shall
bake
the
meat
offering
that
they
bear
them
not
out
into
the
utter
court
to
sanctify
the
people
46
21
then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court
and
caused
me
to
pass
by
the
four
corners
of
the
court
and
behold
in
every
corner
of
the
court
there
was
a
court
46
22
in
the
four
corners
of
the
court
there
were
courts
joined
of
forty
cubits
long
and
thirty
broad
these
four
corners
were
of
one
measure
46
23
and
there
was
a
row
of
building
round
about
in
them
round
about
them
four
and
it
was
made
with
boiling
places
under
the
rows
round
about
46
24
then
said
he
unto
me
these
are
the
places
of
them
that
boil
where
the
ministers
of
the
house
shall
boil
the
sacrifice
of
the
people
47
1
afterward
he
brought
me
again
unto
the
door
of
the
house
and
behold
waters
issued
out
from
under
the
threshold
of
the
house
eastward
for
the
forefront
of
the
house
stood
toward
the
east
and
the
waters
came
down
from
under
from
the
right
side
of
the
house
at
the
south
side
of
the
altar
47
2
then
brought
he
me
out
of
the
way
of
the
gate
northward
and
led
me
about
the
way
without
unto
the
utter
gate
by
the
way
that
looketh
eastward
and
behold
there
ran
out
waters
on
the
right
side
47
3
and
when
the
man
that
had
the
line
in
his
hand
went
forth
eastward
he
measured
a
thousand
cubits
and
he
brought
me
through
the
waters
the
waters
were
to
the
ankles
47
4
again
he
measured
a
thousand
and
brought
me
through
the
waters
the
waters
were
to
the
knees
again
he
measured
a
thousand
and
brought
me
through
the
waters
were
to
the
loins
47
5
afterward
he
measured
a
thousand
and
it
was
a
river
that
i
could
not
pass
over
for
the
waters
were
risen
waters
to
swim
in
a
river
that
could
not
be
passed
over
47
6
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
hast
thou
seen
this
then
he
brought
me
and
caused
me
to
return
to
the
brink
of
the
river
47
7
now
when
i
had
returned
behold
at
the
bank
of
the
river
were
very
many
trees
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
47
8
then
said
he
unto
me
these
waters
issue
out
toward
the
east
country
and
go
down
into
the
desert
and
go
into
the
sea
which
being
brought
forth
into
the
sea
the
waters
shall
be
healed
47
9
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
thing
that
liveth
which
moveth
whithersoever
the
rivers
shall
come
shall
live
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
multitude
of
fish
because
these
waters
shall
come
thither
for
they
shall
be
healed
and
every
thing
shall
live
whither
the
river
cometh
47
10
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
fishers
shall
stand
upon
it
from
engedi
even
unto
eneglaim
they
shall
be
a
place
to
spread
forth
nets
their
fish
shall
be
according
to
their
kinds
as
the
fish
of
the
great
sea
exceeding
many
47
11
but
the
miry
places
thereof
and
the
marishes
thereof
shall
not
be
healed
they
shall
be
given
to
salt
47
12
and
by
the
river
upon
the
bank
thereof
on
this
side
and
on
that
side
shall
grow
all
trees
for
meat
whose
leaf
shall
not
fade
neither
shall
the
fruit
thereof
be
consumed
it
shall
bring
forth
new
fruit
according
to
his
months
because
their
waters
they
issued
out
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
fruit
thereof
shall
be
for
meat
and
the
leaf
thereof
for

the
name
of
belteshazzar
and
to
hananiah
of
shadrach
and
to
mishael
of
meshach
and
to
azariah
of
abednego
1
8
but
daniel
purposed
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
portion
of
the
king’s
meat
nor
with
the
wine
which
he
drank
therefore
he
requested
of
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
that
he
might
not
defile
himself
1
9
now
god
had
brought
daniel
into
favour
and
tender
love
with
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
1
10
and
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
said
unto
daniel
i
fear
my
lord
the
king
who
hath
appointed
your
meat
and
your
drink
for
why
should
he
see
your
faces
worse
liking
than
the
children
which
are
of
your
sort
then
shall
ye
make
me
endanger
my
head
to
the
king
1
11
then
said
daniel
to
melzar
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
had
set
over
daniel
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
1
12
prove
thy
servants
i
beseech
thee
ten
days
and
let
them
give
us
pulse
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
1
13
then
let
our
countenances
be
looked
upon
before
thee
and
the
countenance
of
the
children
that
eat
of
the
portion
of
the
king’s
meat
and
as
thou
seest
deal
with
thy
servants
1
14
so
he
consented
to
them
in
this
matter
and
proved
them
ten
days
1
15
and
at
the
end
of
ten
days
their
countenances
appeared
fairer
and
fatter
in
flesh
than
all
the
children
which
did
eat
the
portion
of
the
king’s
meat
1
16
thus
melzar
took
away
the
portion
of
their
meat
and
the
wine
that
they
should
drink
and
gave
them
pulse
1
17
as
for
these
four
children
god
gave
them
knowledge
and
skill
in
all
learning
and
wisdom
and
daniel
had
understanding
in
all
visions
and
dreams
1
18
now
at
the
end
of
the
days
that
the
king
had
said
he
should
bring
them
in
then
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
brought
them
in
before
nebuchadnezzar
1
19
and
the
king
communed
with
them
and
among
them
all
was
found
none
like
daniel
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
therefore
stood
they
before
the
king
1
20
and
in
all
matters
of
wisdom
and
understanding
that
the
king
enquired
of
them
he
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magicians
and
astrologers
that
were
in
all
his
realm
1
21
and
daniel
continued
even
unto
the
first
year
of
king
cyrus
2
1
and
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
nebuchadnezzar
nebuchadnezzar
dreamed
dreams
wherewith
his
spirit
was
troubled
and
his
sleep
brake
from
him
2
2
then
the
king
commanded
to
call
the
magicians
and
the
astrologers
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
chaldeans
for
to
shew
the
king
his
dreams
so
they
came
and
stood
before
the
king
2
3
and
the
king
said
unto
them
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
and
my
spirit
was
troubled
to
know
the
dream
2
4
then
spake
the
chaldeans
to
the
king
in
syriack
o
king
live
for
ever
tell
thy
servants
the
dream
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
2
5
the
king
answered
and
said
to
the
chaldeans
the
thing
is
gone
from
me
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
with
the
interpretation
thereof
ye
shall
be
cut
in
pieces
and
your
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill
2
6
but
if
ye
shew
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
ye
shall
receive
of
me
gifts
and
rewards
and
great
honour
therefore
shew
me
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
2
7
they
answered
again
and
said
let
the
king
tell
his
servants
the
dream
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
of
it
2
8
the
king
answered
and
said
i
know
of
certainty
that
ye
would
gain
the
time
because
ye
see
the
thing
is
gone
from
me
2
9
but
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
there
is
but
one
decree
for
you
for
ye
have
prepared
lying
and
corrupt
words
to
speak
before
me
till
the
time
be
changed
therefore
tell
me
the
dream
and
i
shall
know
that
ye
can
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof
2
10
the
chaldeans
answered
before
the
king
and
said
there
is
not
a
man
upon
the
earth
that
can
shew
the
king’s
matter
therefore
there
is
no
king
lord
nor
ruler
that
asked
such
things
at
any
magician
or
astrologer
or
chaldean
2
11
and
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth
and
there
is
none
other
that
can
shew
it
before
the
king
except
the
gods
whose
dwelling
is
not
with
flesh
2
12
for
this
cause
the
king
was
angry
and
very
furious
and
commanded
to
destroy
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
2
13
and
the
decree
went
forth
that
the
wise
men
should
be
slain
and
they
sought
daniel
and
his
fellows
to
be
slain
2
14
then
daniel
answered
with
counsel
and
wisdom
to
arioch
the
captain
of
the
king’s
guard
which
was
gone
forth
to
slay
the
wise
men
of
babylon
2
15
he
answered
and
said
to
arioch
the
king’s
captain
why
is
the
decree
so
hasty
from
the
king
then
arioch
made
the
thing
known
to
daniel
2
16
then
daniel
went
in
and
desired
of
the
king
that
he
would
give
him
time
and
that
he
would
shew
the
king
the
interpretation
2
17
then
daniel
went
to
his
house
and
made
the
thing
known
to
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
his
companions
2
18
that
they
would
desire
mercies
of
the
god
of
heaven
concerning
this
secret
that
daniel
and
his
fellows
should
not
perish
with
the
rest
of
the
wise
men
of
babylon
2
19
then
was
the
secret
revealed
unto
daniel
in
a
night
vision
then
daniel
blessed
the
god
of
heaven
2
20
daniel
answered
and
said
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
for
ever
and
ever
for
wisdom
and
might
are
his
2
21
and
he
changeth
the
times
and
the
seasons
he
removeth
kings
and
setteth
up
kings
he
giveth
wisdom
unto
the
wise
and
knowledge
to
them
that
know
understanding
2
22
he
revealeth
the
deep
and
secret
things
he
knoweth
what
is
in
the
darkness
and
the
light
dwelleth
with
him
2
23
i
thank
thee
and
praise
thee
o
thou
god
of
my
fathers
who
hast
given
me
wisdom
and
might
and
hast
made
known
unto
me
now
what
we
desired
of
thee
for
thou
hast
now
made
known
unto
us
the
king’s
matter
2
24
therefore
daniel
went
in
unto
arioch
whom
the
king
had
ordained
to
destroy
the
wise
men
of
babylon
he
went
and
said
thus
unto
him
destroy
not
the
wise
men
of
babylon
bring
me
in
before
the
king
and
i
will
shew
unto
the
king
the
interpretation
2
25
then
arioch
brought
in
daniel
before
the
king
in
haste
and
said
thus
unto
him
i
have
found
a
man
of
the
captives
of
judah
that
will
make
known
unto
the
king
the
interpretation
2
26
the
king
answered
and
said
to
daniel
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
art
thou
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
which
i
have
seen
and
the
interpretation
thereof
2
27
daniel
answered
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
said
the
secret
which
the
king
hath
demanded
cannot
the
wise
men
the
astrologers
the
magicians
the
soothsayers
shew
unto
the
king
2
28
but
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
that
revealeth
secrets
and
maketh
known
to
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
what
shall
be
in
the
latter
days
thy
dream
and
the
visions
of
thy
head
upon
thy
bed
are
these
2
29
as
for
thee
o
king
thy
thoughts
came
into
thy
mind
upon
thy
bed
what
should
come
to
pass
hereafter
and
he
that
revealeth
secrets
maketh
known
to
thee
what
shall
come
to
pass
2
30
but
as
for
me
this
secret
is
not
revealed
to
me
for
any
wisdom
that
i
have
more
than
any
living
but
for
their
sakes
that
shall
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
king
and
that
thou
mightest
know
the
thoughts
of
thy
heart
2
31
thou
o
king
sawest
and
behold
a
great
image
this
great
image
whose
brightness
was
excellent
stood
before
thee
and
the
form
thereof
was
terrible
2
32
this
image’s
head
was
of
fine
gold
his
breast
and
his
arms
of
silver
his
belly
and
his
thighs
of
brass
2
33
his
legs
of
iron
his
feet
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay
2
34
thou
sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
hands
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
that
were
of
iron
and
clay
and
brake
them
to
pieces
2
35
then
was
the
iron
the
clay
the
brass
the
silver
and
the
gold
broken
to
pieces
together
and
became
like
the
chaff
of
the
summer
threshingfloors
and
the
wind
carried
them
away
that
no
place
was
found
for
them
and
the
stone
that
smote
the
image
became
a
great
mountain
and
filled
the
whole
earth
2
36
this
is
the
dream
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
thereof
before
the
king
2
37
thou
o
king
art
a
king
of
kings
for
the
god
of
heaven
hath
given
thee
a
kingdom
power
and
strength
and
glory
2
38
and
wheresoever
the
children
of
men
dwell
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
hath
he
given
into
thine
hand
and
hath
made
thee
ruler
over
them
all
thou
art
this
head
of
gold
2
39
and
after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior
to
thee
and
another
third
kingdom
of
brass
which
shall
bear
rule
over
all
the
earth
2
40
and
the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
iron
forasmuch
as
iron
breaketh
in
pieces
and
subdueth
all
things
and
as
iron
that
breaketh
all
these
shall
it
break
in
pieces
and
bruise
2
41
and
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet
and
toes
part
of
potters’
clay
and
part
of
iron
the
kingdom
shall
be
divided
but
there
shall
be
in
it
of
the
strength
of
the
iron
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
the
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay
2
42
and
as
the
toes
of
the
feet
were
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay
so
the
kingdom
shall
be
partly
strong
and
partly
broken
2
43
and
whereas
thou
sawest
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay
they
shall
mingle
themselves
with
the
seed
of
men
but
they
shall
not
cleave
one
to
another
even
as
iron
is
not
mixed
with
clay
2
44
and
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
the
god
of
heaven
set
up
a
kingdom
which
shall
never
be
destroyed
and
the
kingdom
shall
not
be
left
to
other
people
but
it
shall
break
in
pieces
and
consume
all
these
kingdoms
and
it
shall
stand
for
ever
2
45
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
that
the
stone
was
cut
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands
and
that
it
brake
in
pieces
the
iron
the
brass
the
clay
the
silver
and
the
gold
the
great
god
hath
made
known
to
the
king
what
shall
come
to
pass
hereafter
and
the
dream
is
certain
and
the
interpretation
thereof
sure
2
46
then
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
fell
upon
his
face
and
worshipped
daniel
and
commanded
that
they
should
offer
an
oblation
and
sweet
odours
unto
him
2
47
the
king
answered
unto
daniel
and
said
of
a
truth
it
is
that
your
god
is
a
god
of
gods
and
a
lord
of
kings
and
a
revealer
of
secrets
seeing
thou
couldest
reveal
this
secret
2
48
then
the
king
made
daniel
a
great
man
and
gave
him
many
great
gifts
and
made
him
ruler
over
the
whole
province
of
babylon
and
chief
of
the
governors
over
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
2
49
then
daniel
requested
of
the
king
and
he
set
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
babylon
but
daniel
sat
in
the
gate
of
the
king
3
1
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
made
an
image
of
gold
whose
height
was
threescore
cubits
and
the
breadth
thereof
six
cubits
he
set
it
up
in
the
plain
of
dura
in
the
province
of
babylon
3
2
then
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
sent
to
gather
together
the
princes
the
governors
and
the
captains
the
judges
the
treasurers
the
counsellors
the
sheriffs
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
to
come
to
the
dedication
of
the
image
which
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
3
3
then
the
princes
the
governors
and
captains
the
judges
the
treasurers
the
counsellors
the
sheriffs
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
were
gathered
together
unto
the
dedication
of
the
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
and
they
stood
before
the
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
3
4
then
an
herald
cried
aloud
to
you
it
is
commanded
o
people
nations
and
languages
3
5
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
hath
set
up
3
6
and
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
shall
the
same
hour
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
3
7
therefore
at
that
time
when
all
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
all
kinds
of
musick
all
the
people
the
nations
and
the
languages
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
golden
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
3
8
wherefore
at
that
time
certain
chaldeans
came
near
and
accused
the
jews
3
9
they
spake
and
said
to
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
o
king
live
for
ever
3
10
thou
o
king
hast
made
a
decree
that
every
man
that
shall
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
shall
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image
3
11
and
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
that
he
should
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
3
12
there
are
certain
jews
whom
thou
hast
set
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
babylon
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
these
men
o
king
have
not
regarded
thee
they
serve
not
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
3
13
then
nebuchadnezzar
in
his
rage
and
fury
commanded
to
bring
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
then
they
brought
these
men
before
the
king
3
14
nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
unto
them
is
it
true
o
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
do
not
ye
serve
my
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
i
have
set
up
3
15
now
if
ye
be
ready
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
which
i
have
made
well
but
if
ye
worship
not
ye
shall
be
cast
the
same
hour
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
and
who
is
that
god
that
shall
deliver
you
out
of
my
hands
3
16
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
answered
and
said
to
the
king
o
nebuchadnezzar
we
are
not
careful
to
answer
thee
in
this
matter
3
17
if
it
be
so
our
god
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace
and
he
will
deliver
us
out
of
thine
hand
o
king
3
18
but
if
not
be
it
known
unto
thee
o
king
that
we
will
not
serve
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
3
19
then
was
nebuchadnezzar
full
of
fury
and
the
form
of
his
visage
was
changed
against
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
therefore
he
spake
and
commanded
that
they
should
heat
the
furnace
one
seven
times
more
than
it
was
wont
to
be
heated
3
20
and
he
commanded
the
most
mighty
men
that
were
in
his
army
to
bind
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
and
to
cast
them
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
3
21
then
these
men
were
bound
in
their
coats
their
hosen
and
their
hats
and
their
other
garments
and
were
cast
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
3
22
therefore
because
the
king’s
commandment
was
urgent
and
the
furnace
exceeding
hot
the
flames
of
the
fire
slew
those
men
that
took
up
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
3
23
and
these
three
men
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
fell
down
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
3
24
then
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
was
astonied
and
rose
up
in
haste
and
spake
and
said
unto
his
counsellors
did
not
we
cast
three
men
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
they
answered
and
said
unto
the
king
true
o
king
3
25
he
answered
and
said
lo
i
see
four
men
loose
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
they
have
no
hurt
and
the
form
of
the
fourth
is
like
the
son
of
god
3
26
then
nebuchadnezzar
came
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
and
spake
and
said
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
ye
servants
of
the
most
high
god
come
forth
and
come
hither
then
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
came
forth
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
3
27
and
the
princes
governors
and
captains
and
the
king’s
counsellors
being
gathered
together
saw
these
men
upon
whose
bodies
the
fire
had
no
power
nor
was
an
hair
of
their
head
singed
neither
were
their
coats
changed
nor
the
smell
of
fire
had
passed
on
them
3
28
then
nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
blessed
be
the
god
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
who
hath
sent
his
angel
and
delivered
his
servants
that
trusted
in
him
and
have
changed
the
king’s
word
and
yielded
their
bodies
that
they
might
not
serve
nor
worship
any
god
except
their
own
god
3
29
therefore
i
make
a
decree
that
every
people
nation
and
language
which
speak
any
thing
amiss
against
the
god
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
shall
be
cut
in
pieces
and
their
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill
because
there
is
no
other
god
that
can
deliver
after
this
sort
3
30
then
the
king
promoted
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
in
the
province
of
babylon
4
1
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
unto
all
people
nations
and
languages
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
4
2
i
thought
it
good
to
shew
the
signs
and
wonders
that
the
high
god
hath
wrought
toward
me
4
3
how
great
are
his
signs
and
how
mighty
are
his
wonders
his
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
his
dominion
is
from
generation
to
generation
4
4
i
nebuchadnezzar
was
at
rest
in
mine
house
and
flourishing
in
my
palace
4
5
i
saw
a
dream
which
made
me
afraid
and
the
thoughts
upon
my
bed
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me
4
6
therefore
made
i
a
decree
to
bring
in
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
before
me
that
they
might
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
4
7
then
came
in
the
magicians
the
astrologers
the
chaldeans
and
the
soothsayers
and
i
told
the
dream
before
them
but
they
did
not
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof
4
8
but
at
the
last
daniel
came
in
before
me
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
according
to
the
name
of
my
god
and
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
before
him
i
told
the
dream
saying
4
9
o
belteshazzar
master
of
the
magicians
because
i
know
that
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee
and
no
secret
troubleth
thee
tell
me
the
visions
of
my
dream
that
i
have
seen
and
the
interpretation
thereof
4
10
thus
were
the
visions
of
mine
head
in
my
bed
i
saw
and
behold
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
and
the
height
thereof
was
great
4
11
the
tree
grew
and
was
strong
and
the
height
thereof
reached
unto
heaven
and
the
sight
thereof
to
the
end
of
all
the
earth
4
12
the
leaves
thereof
were
fair
and
the
fruit
thereof
much
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
shadow
under
it
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
dwelt
in
the
boughs
thereof
and
all
flesh
was
fed
of
it
4
13
i
saw
in
the
visions
of
my
head
upon
my
bed
and
behold
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
came
down
from
heaven
4
14
he
cried
aloud
and
said
thus
hew
down
the
tree
and
cut
off
his
branches
shake
off
his
leaves
and
scatter
his
fruit
let
the
beasts
get
away
from
under
it
and
the
fowls
from
his
branches
4
15
nevertheless
leave
the
stump
of
his
roots
in
the
earth
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
in
the
grass
of
the
earth
4
16
let
his
heart
be
changed
from
man’s
and
let
a
beast’s
heart
be
given
unto
him
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
him
4
17
this
matter
is
by
the
decree
of
the
watchers
and
the
demand
by
the
word
of
the
holy
ones
to
the
intent
that
the
living
may
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of
men
4
18
this
dream
i
king
nebuchadnezzar
have
seen
now
thou
o
belteshazzar
declare
the
interpretation
thereof
forasmuch
as
all
the
wise
men
of
my
kingdom
are
not
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
but
thou
art
able
for
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee
4
19
then
daniel
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
was
astonied
for
one
hour
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him
the
king
spake
and
said
belteshazzar
let
not
the
dream
or
the
interpretation
thereof
trouble
thee
belteshazzar
answered
and
said
my
lord
the
dream
be
to
them
that
hate
thee
and
the
interpretation
thereof
to
thine
enemies
4
20
the
tree
that
thou
sawest
which
grew
and
was
strong
whose
height
reached
unto
the
heaven
and
the
sight
thereof
to
all
the
earth
4
21
whose
leaves
were
fair
and
the
fruit
thereof
much
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all
under
which
the
beasts
of
the
field
dwelt
and
upon
whose
branches
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
had
their
habitation
4
22
it
is
thou
o
king
that
art
grown
and
become
strong
for
thy
greatness
is
grown
and
reacheth
unto
heaven
and
thy
dominion
to
the
end
of
the
earth
4
23
and
whereas
the
king
saw
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
coming
down
from
heaven
and
saying
hew
the
tree
down
and
destroy
it
yet
leave
the
stump
of
the
roots
thereof
in
the
earth
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
till
seven
times
pass
over
him
4
24
this
is
the
interpretation
o
king
and
this
is
the
decree
of
the
most
high
which
is
come
upon
my
lord
the
king
4
25
that
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
they
shall
wet
thee
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee
till
thou
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
4
26
and
whereas
they
commanded
to
leave
the
stump
of
the
tree
roots
thy
kingdom
shall
be
sure
unto
thee
after
that
thou
shalt
have
known
that
the
heavens
do
rule
4
27
wherefore
o
king
let
my
counsel
be
acceptable
unto
thee
and
break
off
thy
sins
by
righteousness
and
thine
iniquities
by
shewing
mercy
to
the
poor
if
it
may
be
a
lengthening
of
thy
tranquillity
4
28
all
this
came
upon
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
4
29
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
he
walked
in
the
palace
of
the
kingdom
of
babylon
4
30
the
king
spake
and
said
is
not
this
great
babylon
that
i
have
built
for
the
house
of
the
kingdom
by
the
might
of
my
power
and
for
the
honour
of
my
majesty
4
31
while
the
word
was
in
the
king’s
mouth
there
fell
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
o
king
nebuchadnezzar
to
thee
it
is
spoken
the
kingdom
is
departed
from
thee
4
32
and
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee
until
thou
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
4
33
the
same
hour
was
the
thing
fulfilled
upon
nebuchadnezzar
and
he
was
driven
from
men
and
did
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
his
hairs
were
grown
like
eagles’
feathers
and
his
nails
like
birds’
claws
4
34
and
at
the
end
of
the
days
i
nebuchadnezzar
lifted
up
mine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
mine
understanding
returned
unto
me
and
i
blessed
the
most
high
and
i
praised
and
honoured
him
that
liveth
for
ever
whose
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
and
his
kingdom
is
from
generation
to
generation
4
35
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
reputed
as
nothing
and
he
doeth
according
to
his
will
in
the
army
of
heaven
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
none
can
stay
his
hand
or
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
4
36
at
the
same
time
my
reason
returned
unto
me
and
for
the
glory
of
my
kingdom
mine
honour
and
brightness
returned
unto
me
and
my
counsellors
and
my
lords
sought
unto
me
and
i
was
established
in
my
kingdom
and
excellent
majesty
was
added
unto
me
4
37
now
i
nebuchadnezzar
praise
and
extol
and
honour
the
king
of
heaven
all
whose
works
are
truth
and
his
ways
judgment
and
those
that
walk
in
pride
he
is
able
to
abase
5
1
belshazzar
the
king
made
a
great
feast
to
a
thousand
of
his
lords
and
drank
wine
before
the
thousand
5
2
belshazzar
whiles
he
tasted
the
wine
commanded
to
bring
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
which
his
father
nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
out
of
the
temple
which
was
in
jerusalem
that
the
king
and
his
princes
his
wives
and
his
concubines
might
drink
therein
5
3
then
they
brought
the
golden
vessels
that
were
taken
out
of
the
temple
of
the
house
of
god
which
was
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
and
his
princes
his
wives
and
his
concubines
drank
in
them
5
4
they
drank
wine
and
praised
the
gods
of
gold
and
of
silver
of
brass
of
iron
of
wood
and
of
stone
5
5
in
the
same
hour
came
forth
fingers
of
a
man’s
hand
and
wrote
over
against
the
candlestick
upon
the
plaister
of
the
wall
of
the
king’s
palace
and
the
king
saw
the
part
of
the
hand
that
wrote
5
6
then
the
king’s
countenance
was
changed
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him
so
that
the
joints
of
his
loins
were
loosed
and
his
knees
smote
one
against
another
5
7
the
king
cried
aloud
to
bring
in
the
astrologers
the
chaldeans
and
the
soothsayers
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
the
wise
men
of
babylon
whosoever
shall
read
this
writing
and
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
be
clothed
with
scarlet
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck
and
shall
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
5
8
then
came
in
all
the
king’s
wise
men
but
they
could
not
read
the
writing
nor
make
known
to
the
king
the
interpretation
thereof
5
9
then
was
king
belshazzar
greatly
troubled
and
his
countenance
was
changed
in
him
and
his
lords
were
astonied
5
10
now
the
queen
by
reason
of
the
words
of
the
king
and
his
lords
came
into
the
banquet
house
and
the
queen
spake
and
said
o
king
live
for
ever
let
not
thy
thoughts
trouble
thee
nor
let
thy
countenance
be
changed
5
11
there
is
a
man
in
thy
kingdom
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
in
the
days
of
thy
father
light
and
understanding
and
wisdom
like
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
was
found
in
him
whom
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
the
king
i
say
thy
father
made
master
of
the
magicians
astrologers
chaldeans
and
soothsayers
5
12
forasmuch
as
an
excellent
spirit
and
knowledge
and
understanding
interpreting
of
dreams
and
shewing
of
hard
sentences
and
dissolving
of
doubts
were
found
in
the
same
daniel
whom
the
king
named
belteshazzar
now
let
daniel
be
called
and
he
will
shew
the
interpretation
5
13
then
was
daniel
brought
in
before
the
king
and
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
daniel
art
thou
that
daniel
which
art
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
judah
whom
the
king
my
father
brought
out
of
jewry
5
14
i
have
even
heard
of
thee
that
the
spirit
of
the
gods
is
in
thee
and
that
light
and
understanding
and
excellent
wisdom
is
found
in
thee
5
15
and
now
the
wise
men
the
astrologers
have
been
brought
in
before
me
that
they
should
read
this
writing
and
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof
but
they
could
not
shew
the
interpretation
of
the
thing
5
16
and
i
have
heard
of
thee
that
thou
canst
make
interpretations
and
dissolve
doubts
now
if
thou
canst
read
the
writing
and
make
known
to
me
the
interpretation
thereof
thou
shalt
be
clothed
with
scarlet
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
thy
neck
and
shalt
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
5
17
then
daniel
answered
and
said
before
the
king
let
thy
gifts
be
to
thyself
and
give
thy
rewards
to
another
yet
i
will
read
the
writing
unto
the
king
and
make
known
to
him
the
interpretation
5
18
o
thou
king
the
most
high
god
gave
nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
a
kingdom
and
majesty
and
glory
and
honour
5
19
and
for
the
majesty
that
he
gave
him
all
people
nations
and
languages
trembled
and
feared
before
him
whom
he
would
he
slew
and
whom
he
would
he
kept
alive
and
whom
he
would
he
set
up
and
whom
he
would
he
put
down
5
20
but
when
his
heart
was
lifted
up
and
his
mind
hardened
in
pride
he
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
throne
and
they
took
his
glory
from
him
5
21
and
he
was
driven
from
the
sons
of
men
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
beasts
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
asses
they
fed
him
with
grass
like
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
he
knew
that
the
most
high
god
ruled
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
that
he
appointeth
over
it
whomsoever
he
will
5
22
and
thou
his
son
o
belshazzar
hast
not
humbled
thine
heart
though
thou
knewest
all
this
5
23
but
hast
lifted
up
thyself
against
the
lord
of
heaven
and
they
have
brought
the
vessels
of
his
house
before
thee
and
thou
and
thy
lords
thy
wives
and
thy
concubines
have
drunk
wine
in
them
and
thou
hast
praised
the
gods
of
silver
and
gold
of
brass
iron
wood
and
stone
which
see
not
nor
hear
nor
know
and
the
god
in
whose
hand
thy
breath
is
and
whose
are
all
thy
ways
hast
thou
not
glorified
5
24
then
was
the
part
of
the
hand
sent
from
him
and
this
writing
was
written
5
25
and
this
is
the
writing
that
was
written
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
5
26
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
thing
mene
god
hath
numbered
thy
kingdom
and
finished
it
5
27
tekel
thou
art
weighed
in
the
balances
and
art
found
wanting
5
28
peres
thy
kingdom
is
divided
and
given
to
the
medes
and
persians
5
29
then
commanded
belshazzar
and
they
clothed
daniel
with
scarlet
and
put
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck
and
made
a
proclamation
concerning
him
that
he
should
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
5
30
in
that
night
was
belshazzar
the
king
of
the
chaldeans
slain
5
31
and
darius
the
median
took
the
kingdom
being
about
threescore
and
two
years
old
6
1
it
pleased
darius
to
set
over
the
kingdom
an
hundred
and
twenty
princes
which
should
be
over
the
whole
kingdom
6
2
and
over
these
three
presidents
of
whom
daniel
was
first
that
the
princes
might
give
accounts
unto
them
and
the
king
should
have
no
damage
6
3
then
this
daniel
was
preferred
above
the
presidents
and
princes
because
an
excellent
spirit
was
in
him
and
the
king
thought
to
set
him
over
the
whole
realm
6
4
then
the
presidents
and
princes
sought
to
find
occasion
against
daniel
concerning
the
kingdom
but
they
could
find
none
occasion
nor
fault
forasmuch
as
he
was
faithful
neither
was
there
any
error
or
fault
found
in
him
6
5
then
said
these
men
we
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
daniel
except
we
find
it
against
him
concerning
the
law
of
his
god
6
6
then
these
presidents
and
princes
assembled
together
to
the
king
and
said
thus
unto
him
king
darius
live
for
ever
6
7
all
the
presidents
of
the
kingdom
the
governors
and
the
princes
the
counsellors
and
the
captains
have
consulted
together
to
establish
a
royal
statute
and
to
make
a
firm
decree
that
whosoever
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
god
or
man
for
thirty
days
save
of
thee
o
king
he
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions
6
8
now
o
king
establish
the
decree
and
sign
the
writing
that
it
be
not
changed
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
which
altereth
not
6
9
wherefore
king
darius
signed
the
writing
and
the
decree
6
10
now
when
daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
signed
he
went
into
his
house
and
his
windows
being
open
in
his
chamber
toward
jerusalem
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
god
as
he
did
aforetime
6
11
then
these
men
assembled
and
found
daniel
praying
and
making
supplication
before
his
god
6
12
then
they
came
near
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
king’s
decree
hast
thou
not
signed
a
decree
that
every
man
that
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
god
or
man
within
thirty
days
save
of
thee
o
king
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions
the
king
answered
and
said
the
thing
is
true
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
which
altereth
not
6
13
then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
king
that
daniel
which
is
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
judah
regardeth
not
thee
o
king
nor
the
decree
that
thou
hast
signed
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
a
day
6
14
then
the
king
when
he
heard
these
words
was
sore
displeased
with
himself
and
set
his
heart
on
daniel
to
deliver
him
and
he
laboured
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
to
deliver
him
6
15
then
these
men
assembled
unto
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
know
o
king
that
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
is
that
no
decree
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
be
changed
6
16
then
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
daniel
and
cast
him
into
the
den
of
lions
now
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
daniel
thy
god
whom
thou
servest
continually
he
will
deliver
thee
6
17
and
a
stone
was
brought
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
of
the
den
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
own
signet
and
with
the
signet
of
his
lords
that
the
purpose
might
not
be
changed
concerning
daniel
6
18
then
the
king
went
to
his
palace
and
passed
the
night
fasting
neither
were
instruments
of
musick
brought
before
him
and
his
sleep
went
from
him
6
19
then
the
king
arose
very
early
in
the
morning
and
went
in
haste
unto
the
den
of
lions
6
20
and
when
he
came
to
the
den
he
cried
with
a
lamentable
voice
unto
daniel
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
daniel
o
daniel
servant
of
the
living
god
is
thy
god
whom
thou
servest
continually
able
to
deliver
thee
from
the
lions
6
21
then
said
daniel
unto
the
king
o
king
live
for
ever
6
22
my
god
hath
sent
his
angel
and
hath
shut
the
lions’
mouths
that
they
have
not
hurt
me
forasmuch
as
before
him
innocency
was
found
in
me
and
also
before
thee
o
king
have
i
done
no
hurt
6
23
then
was
the
king
exceedingly
glad
for
him
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
daniel
up
out
of
the
den
so
daniel
was
taken
up
out
of
the
den
and
no
manner
of
hurt
was
found
upon
him
because
he
believed
in
his
god
6
24
and
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
those
men
which
had
accused
daniel
and
they
cast
them
into
the
den
of
lions
them
their
children
and
their
wives
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
of
them
and
brake
all
their
bones
in
pieces
or
ever
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
den
6
25
then
king
darius
wrote
unto
all
people
nations
and
languages
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
6
26
i
make
a
decree
that
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
god
of
daniel
for
he
is
the
living
god
and
stedfast
for
ever
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
and
his
dominion
shall
be
even
unto
the
end
6
27
he
delivereth
and
rescueth
and
he
worketh
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven
and
in
earth
who
hath
delivered
daniel
from
the
power
of
the
lions
6
28
so
this
daniel
prospered
in
the
reign
of
darius
and
in
the
reign
of
cyrus
the
persian
7
1
in
the
first
year
of
belshazzar
king
of
babylon
daniel
had
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
upon
his
bed
then
he
wrote
the
dream
and
told
the
sum
of
the
matters
7
2
daniel
spake
and
said
i
saw
in
my
vision
by
night
and
behold
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
strove
upon
the
great
sea
7
3
and
four
great
beasts
came
up
from
the
sea
diverse
one
from
another
7
4
the
first
was
like
a
lion
and
had
eagle’s
wings
i
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
plucked
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
the
earth
and
made
stand
upon
the
feet
as
a
man
and
a
man’s
heart
was
given
to
it
7
5
and
behold
another
beast
a
second
like
to
a
bear
and
it
raised
up
itself
on
one
side
and
it
had
three
ribs
in
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
teeth
of
it
and
they
said
thus
unto
it
arise
devour
much
flesh
7
6
after
this
i
beheld
and
lo
another
like
a
leopard
which
had
upon
the
back
of
it
four
wings
of
a
fowl
the
beast
had
also
four
heads
and
dominion
was
given
to
it
7
7
after
this
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
a
fourth
beast
dreadful
and
terrible
and
strong
exceedingly
and
it
had
great
iron
teeth
it
devoured
and
brake
in
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
the
feet
of
it
and
it
was
diverse
from
all
the
beasts
that
were
before
it
and
it
had
ten
horns
7
8
i
considered
the
horns
and
behold
there
came
up
among
them
another
little
horn
before
whom
there
were
three
of
the
first
horns
plucked
up
by
the
roots
and
behold
in
this
horn
were
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
man
and
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
7
9
i
beheld
till
the
thrones
were
cast
down
and
the
ancient
of
days
did
sit
whose
garment
was
white
as
snow
and
the
hair
of
his
head
like
the
pure
wool
his
throne
was
like
the
fiery
flame
and
his
wheels
as
burning
fire
7
10
a
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
him
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
him
the
judgment
was
set
and
the
books
were
opened
7
11
i
beheld
then
because
of
the
voice
of
the
great
words
which
the
horn
spake
i
beheld
even
till
the
beast
was
slain
and
his
body
destroyed
and
given
to
the
burning
flame
7
12
as
concerning
the
rest
of
the
beasts
they
had
their
dominion
taken
away
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
season
and
time
7
13
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
7
14
and
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
a
kingdom
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
7
15
i
daniel
was
grieved
in
my
spirit
in
the
midst
of
my
body
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me
7
16
i
came
near
unto
one
of
them
that
stood
by
and
asked
him
the
truth
of
all
this
so
he
told
me
and
made
me
know
the
interpretation
of
the
things
7
17
these
great
beasts
which
are
four
are
four
kings
which
shall
arise
out
of
the
earth
7
18
but
the
saints
of
the
most
high
shall
take
the
kingdom
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
ever
even
for
ever
and
ever
7
19
then
i
would
know
the
truth
of
the
fourth
beast
which
was
diverse
from
all
the
others
exceeding
dreadful
whose
teeth
were
of
iron
and
his
nails
of
brass
which
devoured
brake
in
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
his
feet
7
20
and
of
the
ten
horns
that
were
in
his
head
and
of
the
other
which
came
up
and
before
whom
three
fell
even
of
that
horn
that
had
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
spake
very
great
things
whose
look
was
more
stout
than
his
fellows
7
21
i
beheld
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
saints
and
prevailed
against
them
7
22
until
the
ancient
of
days
came
and
judgment
was
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
possessed
the
kingdom
7
23
thus
he
said
the
fourth
beast
shall
be
the
fourth
kingdom
upon
earth
which
shall
be
diverse
from
all
kingdoms
and
shall
devour
the
whole
earth
and
shall
tread
it
down
and
break
it
in
pieces
7
24
and
the
ten
horns
out
of
this
kingdom
are
ten
kings
that
shall
arise
and
another
shall
rise
after
them
and
he
shall
be
diverse
from
the
first
and
he
shall
subdue
three
kings
7
25
and
he
shall
speak
great
words
against
the
most
high
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
think
to
change
times
and
laws
and
they
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
the
dividing
of
time
7
26
but
the
judgment
shall
sit
and
they
shall
take
away
his
dominion
to
consume
and
to
destroy
it
unto
the
end
7
27
and
the
kingdom
and
dominion
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heaven
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
high
whose
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
him
7
28
hitherto
is
the
end
of
the
matter
as
for
me
daniel
my
cogitations
much
troubled
me
and
my
countenance
changed
in
me
but
i
kept
the
matter
in
my
heart
8
1
in
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
king
belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
unto
me
even
unto
me
daniel
after
that
which
appeared
unto
me
at
the
first
8
2
and
i
saw
in
a
vision
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
saw
that
i
was
at
shushan
in
the
palace
which
is
in
the
province
of
elam
and
i
saw
in
a
vision
and
i
was
by
the
river
of
ulai
8
3
then
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
saw
and
behold
there
stood
before
the
river
a
ram
which
had
two
horns
and
the
two
horns
were
high
but
one
was
higher
than
the
other
and
the
higher
came
up
last
8
4
i
saw
the
ram
pushing
westward
and
northward
and
southward
so
that
no
beasts
might
stand
before
him
neither
was
there
any
that
could
deliver
out
of
his
hand
but
he
did
according
to
his
will
and
became
great
8
5
and
as
i
was
considering
behold
an
he
goat
came
from
the
west
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
and
touched
not
the
ground
and
the
goat
had
a
notable
horn
between
his
eyes
8
6
and
he
came
to
the
ram
that
had
two
horns
which
i
had
seen
standing
before
the
river
and
ran
unto
him
in
the
fury
of
his
power
8
7
and
i
saw
him
come
close
unto
the
ram
and
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
him
and
smote
the
ram
and
brake
his
two
horns
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
ram
to
stand
before
him
but
he
cast
him
down
to
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
him
and
there
was
none
that
could
deliver
the
ram
out
of
his
hand
8
8
therefore
the
he
goat
waxed
very
great
and
when
he
was
strong
the
great
horn
was
broken
and
for
it
came
up
four
notable
ones
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven
8
9
and
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
horn
which
waxed
exceeding
great
toward
the
south
and
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
pleasant
land
8
10
and
it
waxed
great
even
to
the
host
of
heaven
and
it
cast
down
some
of
the
host
and
of
the
stars
to
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
them
8
11
yea
he
magnified
himself
even
to
the
prince
of
the
host
and
by
him
the
daily
sacrifice
was
taken
away
and
the
place
of
the
sanctuary
was
cast
down
8
12
and
an
host
was
given
him
against
the
daily
sacrifice
by
reason
of
transgression
and
it
cast
down
the
truth
to
the
ground
and
it
practised
and
prospered
8
13
then
i
heard
one
saint
speaking
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
saint
which
spake
how
long
shall
be
the
vision
concerning
the
daily
sacrifice
and
the
transgression
of
desolation
to
give
both
the
sanctuary
and
the
host
to
be
trodden
under
foot
8
14
and
he
said
unto
me
unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
days
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
cleansed
8
15
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
even
i
daniel
had
seen
the
vision
and
sought
for
the
meaning
then
behold
there
stood
before
me
as
the
appearance
of
a
man
8
16
and
i
heard
a
man’s
voice
between
the
banks
of
ulai
which
called
and
said
gabriel
make
this
man
to
understand
the
vision
8
17
so
he
came
near
where
i
stood
and
when
he
came
i
was
afraid
and
fell
upon
my
face
but
he
said
unto
me
understand
o
son
of
man
for
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
be
the
vision
8
18
now
as
he
was
speaking
with
me
i
was
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
toward
the
ground
but
he
touched
me
and
set
me
upright
8
19
and
he
said
behold
i
will
make
thee
know
what
shall
be
in
the
last
end
of
the
indignation
for
at
the
time
appointed
the
end
shall
be
8
20
the
ram
which
thou
sawest
having
two
horns
are
the
kings
of
media
and
persia
8
21
and
the
rough
goat
is
the
king
of
grecia
and
the
great
horn
that
is
between
his
eyes
is
the
first
king
8
22
now
that
being
broken
whereas
four
stood
up
for
it
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out
of
the
nation
but
not
in
his
power
8
23
and
in
the
latter
time
of
their
kingdom
when
the
transgressors
are
come
to
the
full
a
king
of
fierce
countenance
and
understanding
dark
sentences
shall
stand
up
8
24
and
his
power
shall
be
mighty
but
not
by
his
own
power
and
he
shall
destroy
wonderfully
and
shall
prosper
and
practise
and
shall
destroy
the
mighty
and
the
holy
people
8
25
and
through
his
policy
also
he
shall
cause
craft
to
prosper
in
his
hand
and
he
shall
magnify
himself
in
his
heart
and
by
peace
shall
destroy
many
he
shall
also
stand
up
against
the
prince
of
princes
but
he
shall
be
broken
without
hand
8
26
and
the
vision
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
which
was
told
is
true
wherefore
shut
thou
up
the
vision
for
it
shall
be
for
many
days
8
27
and
i
daniel
fainted
and
was
sick
certain
days
afterward
i
rose
up
and
did
the
king’s
business
and
i
was
astonished
at
the
vision
but
none
understood
it
9
1
in
the
first
year
of
darius
the
son
of
ahasuerus
of
the
seed
of
the
medes
which
was
made
king
over
the
realm
of
the
chaldeans
9
2
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
i
daniel
understood
by
books
the
number
of
the
years
whereof
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
that
he
would
accomplish
seventy
years
in
the
desolations
of
jerusalem
9
3
and
i
set
my
face
unto
the
lord
god
to
seek
by
prayer
and
supplications
with
fasting
and
sackcloth
and
ashes
9
4
and
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
my
god
and
made
my
confession
and
said
o
lord
the
great
and
dreadful
god
keeping
the
covenant
and
mercy
to
them
that
love
him
and
to
them
that
keep
his
commandments
9
5
we
have
sinned
and
have
committed
iniquity
and
have
done
wickedly
and
have
rebelled
even
by
departing
from
thy
precepts
and
from
thy
judgments
9
6
neither
have
we
hearkened
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets
which
spake
in
thy
name
to
our
kings
our
princes
and
our
fathers
and
to
all
the
people
of
the
land
9
7
o
lord
righteousness
belongeth
unto
thee
but
unto
us
confusion
of
faces
as
at
this
day
to
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
unto
all
israel
that
are
near
and
that
are
far
off
through
all
the
countries
whither
thou
hast
driven
them
because
of
their
trespass
that
they
have
trespassed
against
thee
9
8
o
lord
to
us
belongeth
confusion
of
face
to
our
kings
to
our
princes
and
to
our
fathers
because
we
have
sinned
against
thee
9
9
to
the
lord
our
god
belong
mercies
and
forgivenesses
though
we
have
rebelled
against
him
9
10
neither
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
to
walk
in
his
laws
which
he
set
before
us
by
his
servants
the
prophets
9
11
yea
all
israel
have
transgressed
thy
law
even
by
departing
that
they
might
not
obey
thy
voice
therefore
the
curse
is
poured
upon
us
and
the
oath
that
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
the
servant
of
god
because
we
have
sinned
against
him
9
12
and
he
hath
confirmed
his
words
which
he
spake
against
us
and
against
our
judges
that
judged
us
by
bringing
upon
us
a
great
evil
for
under
the
whole
heaven
hath
not
been
done
as
hath
been
done
upon
jerusalem
9
13
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
all
this
evil
is
come
upon
us
yet
made
we
not
our
prayer
before
the
lord
our
god
that
we
might
turn
from
our
iniquities
and
understand
thy
truth
9
14
therefore
hath
the
lord
watched
upon
the
evil
and
brought
it
upon
us
for
the
lord
our
god
is
righteous
in
all
his
works
which
he
doeth
for
we
obeyed
not
his
voice
9
15
and
now
o
lord
our
god
that
hast
brought
thy
people
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
hast
gotten
thee
renown
as
at
this
day
we
have
sinned
we
have
done
wickedly
9
16
o
lord
according
to
all
thy
righteousness
i
beseech
thee
let
thine
anger
and
thy
fury
be
turned
away
from
thy
city
jerusalem
thy
holy
mountain
because
for
our
sins
and
for
the
iniquities
of
our
fathers
jerusalem
and
thy
people
are
become
a
reproach
to
all
that
are
about
us
9
17
now
therefore
o
our
god
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
his
supplications
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
sanctuary
that
is
desolate
for
the
lord’s
sake
9
18
o
my
god
incline
thine
ear
and
hear
open
thine
eyes
and
behold
our
desolations
and
the
city
which
is
called
by
thy
name
for
we
do
not
present
our
supplications
before
thee
for
our
righteousnesses
but
for
thy
great
mercies
9
19
o
lord
hear
o
lord
forgive
o
lord
hearken
and
do
defer
not
for
thine
own
sake
o
my
god
for
thy
city
and
thy
people
are
called
by
thy
name
9
20
and
whiles
i
was
speaking
and
praying
and
confessing
my
sin
and
the
sin
of
my
people
israel
and
presenting
my
supplication
before
the
lord
my
god
for
the
holy
mountain
of
my
god
9
21
yea
whiles
i
was
speaking
in
prayer
even
the
man
gabriel
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
vision
at
the
beginning
being
caused
to
fly
swiftly
touched
me
about
the
time
of
the
evening
oblation
9
22
and
he
informed
me
and
talked
with
me
and
said
o
daniel
i
am
now
come
forth
to
give
thee
skill
and
understanding
9
23
at
the
beginning
of
thy
supplications
the
commandment
came
forth
and
i
am
come
to
shew
thee
for
thou
art
greatly
beloved
therefore
understand
the
matter
and
consider
the
vision
9
24
seventy
weeks
are
determined
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
holy
city
to
finish
the
transgression
and
to
make
an
end
of
sins
and
to
make
reconciliation
for
iniquity
and
to
bring
in
everlasting
righteousness
and
to
seal
up
the
vision
and
prophecy
and
to
anoint
the
most
holy
9
25
know
therefore
and
understand
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
restore
and
to
build
jerusalem
unto
the
messiah
the
prince
shall
be
seven
weeks
and
threescore
and
two
weeks
the
street
shall
be
built
again
and
the
wall
even
in
troublous
times
9
26
and
after
threescore
and
two
weeks
shall
messiah
be
cut
off
but
not
for
himself
and
the
people
of
the
prince
that
shall
come
shall
destroy
the
city
and
the
sanctuary
and
the
end
thereof
shall
be
with
a
flood
and
unto
the
end
of
the
war
desolations
are
determined
9
27
and
he
shall
confirm
the
covenant
with
many
for
one
week
and
in
the
midst
of
the
week
he
shall
cause
the
sacrifice
and
the
oblation
to
cease
and
for
the
overspreading
of
abominations
he
shall
make
it
desolate
even
until
the
consummation
and
that
determined
shall
be
poured
upon
the
desolate
10
1
in
the
third
year
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
a
thing
was
revealed
unto
daniel
whose
name
was
called
belteshazzar
and
the
thing
was
true
but
the
time
appointed
was
long
and
he
understood
the
thing
and
had
understanding
of
the
vision
10
2
in
those
days
i
daniel
was
mourning
three
full
weeks
10
3
i
ate
no
pleasant
bread
neither
came
flesh
nor
wine
in
my
mouth
neither
did
i
anoint
myself
at
all
till
three
whole
weeks
were
fulfilled
10
4
and
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
first
month
as
i
was
by
the
side
of
the
great
river
which
is
hiddekel
10
5
then
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
certain
man
clothed
in
linen
whose
loins
were
girded
with
fine
gold
of
uphaz
10
6
his
body
also
was
like
the
beryl
and
his
face
as
the
appearance
of
lightning
and
his
eyes
as
lamps
of
fire
and
his
arms
and
his
feet
like
in
colour
to
polished
brass
and
the
voice
of
his
words
like
the
voice
of
a
multitude
10
7
and
i
daniel
alone
saw
the
vision
for
the
men
that
were
with
me
saw
not
the
vision
but
a
great
quaking
fell
upon
them
so
that
they
fled
to
hide
themselves
10
8
therefore
i
was
left
alone
and
saw
this
great
vision
and
there
remained
no
strength
in
me
for
my
comeliness
was
turned
in
me
into
corruption
and
i
retained
no
strength
10
9
yet
heard
i
the
voice
of
his
words
and
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
his
words
then
was
i
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
and
my
face
toward
the
ground
10
10
and
behold
an
hand
touched
me
which
set
me
upon
my
knees
and
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
10
11
and
he
said
unto
me
o
daniel
a
man
greatly
beloved
understand
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
thee
and
stand
upright
for
unto
thee
am
i
now
sent
and
when
he
had
spoken
this
word
unto
me
i
stood
trembling
10
12
then
said
he
unto
me
fear
not
daniel
for
from
the
first
day
that
thou
didst
set
thine
heart
to
understand
and
to
chasten
thyself
before
thy
god
thy
words
were
heard
and
i
am
come
for
thy
words
10
13
but
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
withstood
me
one
and
twenty
days
but
lo
michael
one
of
the
chief
princes
came
to
help
me
and
i
remained
there
with
the
kings
of
persia
10
14
now
i
am
come
to
make
thee
understand
what
shall
befall
thy
people
in
the
latter
days
for
yet
the
vision
is
for
many
days
10
15
and
when
he
had
spoken
such
words
unto
me
i
set
my
face
toward
the
ground
and
i
became
dumb
10
16
and
behold
one
like
the
similitude
of
the
sons
of
men
touched
my
lips
then
i
opened
my
mouth
and
spake
and
said
unto
him
that
stood
before
me
o
my
lord
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
me
and
i
have
retained
no
strength
10
17
for
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
lord
for
as
for
me
straightway
there
remained
no
strength
in
me
neither
is
there
breath
left
in
me
10
18
then
there
came
again
and
touched
me
one
like
the
appearance
of
a
man
and
he
strengthened
me
10
19
and
said
o
man
greatly
beloved
fear
not
peace
be
unto
thee
be
strong
yea
be
strong
and
when
he
had
spoken
unto
me
i
was
strengthened
and
said
let
my
lord
speak
for
thou
hast
strengthened
me
10
20
then
said
he
knowest
thou
wherefore
i
come
unto
thee
and
now
will
i
return
to
fight
with
the
prince
of
persia
and
when
i
am
gone
forth
lo
the
prince
of
grecia
shall
come
10
21
but
i
will
shew
thee
that
which
is
noted
in
the
scripture
of
truth
and
there
is
none
that
holdeth
with
me
in
these
things
but
michael
your
prince
11
1
also
i
in
the
first
year
of
darius
the
mede
even
i
stood
to
confirm
and
to
strengthen
him
11
2
and
now
will
i
shew
thee
the
truth
behold
there
shall
stand
up
yet
three
kings
in
persia
and
the
fourth
shall
be
far
richer
than
they
all
and
by
his
strength
through
his
riches
he
shall
stir
up
all
against
the
realm
of
grecia
11
3
and
a
mighty
king
shall
stand
up
that
shall
rule
with
great
dominion
and
do
according
to
his
will
11
4
and
when
he
shall
stand
up
his
kingdom
shall
be
broken
and
shall
be
divided
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
not
to
his
posterity
nor
according
to
his
dominion
which
he
ruled
for
his
kingdom
shall
be
plucked
up
even
for
others
beside
those
11
5
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
strong
and
one
of
his
princes
and
he
shall
be
strong
above
him
and
have
dominion
his
dominion
shall
be
a
great
dominion
11
6
and
in
the
end
of
years
they
shall
join
themselves
together
for
the
king’s
daughter
of
the
south
shall
come
to
the
king
of
the
north
to
make
an
agreement
but
she
shall
not
retain
the
power
of
the
arm
neither
shall
he
stand
nor
his
arm
but
she
shall
be
given
up
and
they
that
brought
her
and
he
that
begat
her
and
he
that
strengthened
her
in
these
times
11
7
but
out
of
a
branch
of
her
roots
shall
one
stand
up
in
his
estate
which
shall
come
with
an
army
and
shall
enter
into
the
fortress
of
the
king
of
the
north
and
shall
deal
against
them
and
shall
prevail
11
8
and
shall
also
carry
captives
into
egypt
their
gods
with
their
princes
and
with
their
precious
vessels
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
he
shall
continue
more
years
than
the
king
of
the
north
11
9
so
the
king
of
the
south
shall
come
into
his
kingdom
and
shall
return
into
his
own
land
11
10
but
his
sons
shall
be
stirred
up
and
shall
assemble
a
multitude
of
great
forces
and
one
shall
certainly
come
and
overflow
and
pass
through
then
shall
he
return
and
be
stirred
up
even
to
his
fortress
11
11
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
moved
with
choler
and
shall
come
forth
and
fight
with
him
even
with
the
king
of
the
north
and
he
shall
set
forth
a
great
multitude
but
the
multitude
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
11
12
and
when
he
hath
taken
away
the
multitude
his
heart
shall
be
lifted
up
and
he
shall
cast
down
many
ten
thousands
but
he
shall
not
be
strengthened
by
it
11
13
for
the
king
of
the
north
shall
return
and
shall
set
forth
a
multitude
greater
than
the
former
and
shall
certainly
come
after
certain
years
with
a
great
army
and
with
much
riches
11
14
and
in
those
times
there
shall
many
stand
up
against
the
king
of
the
south
also
the
robbers
of
thy
people
shall
exalt
themselves
to
establish
the
vision
but
they
shall
fall
11
15
so
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come
and
cast
up
a
mount
and
take
the
most
fenced
cities
and
the
arms
of
the
south
shall
not
withstand
neither
his
chosen
people
neither
shall
there
be
any
strength
to
withstand
11
16
but
he
that
cometh
against
him
shall
do
according
to
his
own
will
and
none
shall
stand
before
him
and
he
shall
stand
in
the
glorious
land
which
by
his
hand
shall
be
consumed
11
17
he
shall
also
set
his
face
to
enter
with
the
strength
of
his
whole
kingdom
and
upright
ones
with
him
thus
shall
he
do
and
he
shall
give
him
the
daughter
of
women
corrupting
her
but
she
shall
not
stand
on
his
side
neither
be
for
him
11
18
after
this
shall
he
turn
his
face
unto
the
isles
and
shall
take
many
but
a
prince
for
his
own
behalf
shall
cause
the
reproach
offered
by
him
to
cease
without
his
own
reproach
he
shall
cause
it
to
turn
upon
him
11
19
then
he
shall
turn
his
face
toward
the
fort
of
his
own
land
but
he
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
not
be
found
11
20
then
shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
a
raiser
of
taxes
in
the
glory
of
the
kingdom
but
within
few
days
he
shall
be
destroyed
neither
in
anger
nor
in
battle
11
21
and
in
his
estate
shall
stand
up
a
vile
person
to
whom
they
shall
not
give
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
but
he
shall
come
in
peaceably
and
obtain
the
kingdom
by
flatteries
11
22
and
with
the
arms
of
a
flood
shall
they
be
overflown
from
before
him
and
shall
be
broken
yea
also
the
prince
of
the
covenant
11
23
and
after
the
league
made
with
him
he
shall
work
deceitfully
for
he
shall
come
up
and
shall
become
strong
with
a
small
people
11
24
he
shall
enter
peaceably
even
upon
the
fattest
places
of
the
province
and
he
shall
do
that
which
his
fathers
have
not
done
nor
his
fathers’
fathers
he
shall
scatter
among
them
the
prey
and
spoil
and
riches
yea
and
he
shall
forecast
his
devices
against
the
strong
holds
even
for
a
time
11
25
and
he
shall
stir
up
his
power
and
his
courage
against
the
king
of
the
south
with
a
great
army
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
stirred
up
to
battle
with
a
very
great
and
mighty
army
but
he
shall
not
stand
for
they
shall
forecast
devices
against
him
11
26
yea
they
that
feed
of
the
portion
of
his
meat
shall
destroy
him
and
his
army
shall
overflow
and
many
shall
fall
down
slain
11
27
and
both
of
these
kings’
hearts
shall
be
to
do
mischief
and
they
shall
speak
lies
at
one
table
but
it
shall
not
prosper
for
yet
the
end
shall
be
at
the
time
appointed
11
28
then
shall
he
return
into
his
land
with
great
riches
and
his
heart
shall
be
against
the
holy
covenant
and
he
shall
do
exploits
and
return
to
his
own
land
11
29
at
the
time
appointed
he
shall
return
and
come
toward
the
south
but
it
shall
not
be
as
the
former
or
as
the
latter
11
30
for
the
ships
of
chittim
shall
come
against
him
therefore
he
shall
be
grieved
and
return
and
have
indignation
against
the
holy
covenant
so
shall
he
do
he
shall
even
return
and
have
intelligence
with
them
that
forsake
the
holy
covenant
11
31
and
arms
shall
stand
on
his
part
and
they
shall
pollute
the
sanctuary
of
strength
and
shall
take
away
the
daily
sacrifice
and
they
shall
place
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
11
32
and
such
as
do
wickedly
against
the
covenant
shall
he
corrupt
by
flatteries
but
the
people
that
do
know
their
god
shall
be
strong
and
do
exploits
11
33
and
they
that
understand
among
the
people
shall
instruct
many
yet
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
by
flame
by
captivity
and
by
spoil
many
days
11
34
now
when
they
shall
fall
they
shall
be
holpen
with
a
little
help
but
many
shall
cleave
to
them
with
flatteries
11
35
and
some
of
them
of
understanding
shall
fall
to
try
them
and
to
purge
and
to
make
them
white
even
to
the
time
of
the
end
because
it
is
yet
for
a
time
appointed
11
36
and
the
king
shall
do
according
to
his
will
and
he
shall
exalt
himself
and
magnify
himself
above
every
god
and
shall
speak
marvellous
things
against
the
god
of
gods
and
shall
prosper
till
the
indignation
be
accomplished
for
that
that
is
determined
shall
be
done
11
37
neither
shall
he
regard
the
god
of
his
fathers
nor
the
desire
of
women
nor
regard
any
god
for
he
shall
magnify
himself
above
all
11
38
but
in
his
estate
shall
he
honour
the
god
of
forces
and
a
god
whom
his
fathers
knew
not
shall
he
honour
with
gold
and
silver
and
with
precious
stones
and
pleasant
things
11
39
thus
shall
he
do
in
the
most
strong
holds
with
a
strange
god
whom
he
shall
acknowledge
and
increase
with
glory
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
rule
over
many
and
shall
divide
the
land
for
gain
11
40
and
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
the
king
of
the
south
push
at
him
and
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come
against
him
like
a
whirlwind
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
and
with
many
ships
and
he
shall
enter
into
the
countries
and
shall
overflow
and
pass
over
11
41
he
shall
enter
also
into
the
glorious
land
and
many
countries
shall
be
overthrown
but
these
shall
escape
out
of
his
hand
even
edom
and
moab
and
the
chief
of
the
children
of
ammon
11
42
he
shall
stretch
forth
his
hand
also
upon
the
countries
and
the
land
of
egypt
shall
not
escape
11
43
but
he
shall
have
power
over
the
treasures
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
over
all
the
precious
things
of
egypt
and
the
libyans
and
the
ethiopians
shall
be
at
his
steps
11
44
but
tidings
out
of
the
east
and
out
of
the
north
shall
trouble
him
therefore
he
shall
go
forth
with
great
fury
to
destroy
and
utterly
to
make
away
many
11
45
and
he
shall
plant
the
tabernacles
of
his
palace
between
the
seas
in
the
glorious
holy
mountain
yet
he
shall
come
to
his
end
and
none
shall
help
him
12
1
and
at
that
time
shall
michael
stand
up
the
great
prince
which
standeth
for
the
children
of
thy
people
and
there
shall
be
a
time
of
trouble
such
as
never
was
since
there
was
a
nation
even
to
that
same
time
and
at
that
time
thy
people
shall
be
delivered
every
one
that
shall
be
found
written
in
the
book
12
2
and
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake
some
to
everlasting
life
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
contempt
12
3
and
they
that
be
wise
shall
shine
as
the
brightness
of
the
firmament
and
they
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
as
the
stars
for
ever
and
ever
12
4
but
thou
o
daniel
shut
up
the
words
and
seal
the
book
even
to
the
time
of
the
end
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
shall
be
increased
12
5
then
i
daniel
looked
and
behold
there
stood
other
two
the
one
on
this
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river
and
the
other
on
that
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river
12
6
and
one
said
to
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
how
long
shall
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
wonders
12
7
and
i
heard
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
when
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
unto
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
that
it
shall
be
for
a
time
times
and
an
half
and
when
he
shall
have
accomplished
to
scatter
the
power
of
the
holy
people
all
these
things
shall
be
finished
12
8
and
i
heard
but
i
understood
not
then
said
i
o
my
lord
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
12
9
and
he
said
go
thy
way
daniel
for
the
words
are
closed
up
and
sealed
till
the
time
of
the
end
12
10
many
shall
be
purified
and
made
white
and
tried
but
the
wicked
shall
do
wickedly
and
none
of
the
wicked
shall
understand
but
the
wise
shall
understand
12
11
and
from
the
time
that
the
daily
sacrifice
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
set
up
there
shall
be
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
days
12
12
blessed
is
he
that
waiteth
and
cometh
to
the
thousand
three
hundred
and
five
and
thirty
days
12
13
but
go
thou
thy
way
till
the
end
be
for
thou
shalt
rest
and
stand
in
thy
lot
at
the
end
of
the
days
hosea
1
1
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
unto
hosea
the
son
of
beeri
in
the
days
of
uzziah
jotham
ahaz
and
hezekiah
kings
of
judah
and
in
the
days
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of
israel
1
2
the
beginning
of
the
word
of
the
lord
by
hosea
and
the
lord
said
to
hosea
go
take
unto
thee
a
wife
of
whoredoms
and
children
of
whoredoms
for
the
land
hath
committed
great
whoredom
departing
from
the
lord
1
3
so
he
went
and
took
gomer
the
daughter
of
diblaim
which
conceived
and
bare
him
a
son
1
4
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
call
his
name
jezreel
for
yet
a
little
while
and
i
will
avenge
the
blood
of
jezreel
upon
the
house
of
jehu
and
will
cause
to
cease
the
kingdom
of
the
house
of
israel
1
5
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day
that
i
will
break
the
bow
of
israel
in
the
valley
of
jezreel
1
6
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
daughter
and
god
said
unto
him
call
her
name
loruhamah
for
i
will
no
more
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
israel
but
i
will
utterly
take
them
away
1
7
but
i
will
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
judah
and
will
save
them
by
the
lord
their
god
and
will
not
save
them
by
bow
nor
by
sword
nor
by
battle
by
horses
nor
by
horsemen
1
8
now
when
she
had
weaned
loruhamah
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
1
9
then
said
god
call
his
name
loammi
for
ye
are
not
my
people
and
i
will
not
be
your
god
1
10
yet
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
which
cannot
be
measured
nor
numbered
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them
ye
are
not
my
people
there
it
shall
be
said
unto
them
ye
are
the
sons
of
the
living
god
1
11
then
shall
the
children
of
judah
and
the
children
of
israel
be
gathered
together
and
appoint
themselves
one
head
and
they
shall
come
up
out
of
the
land
for
great
shall
be
the
day
of
jezreel
2
1
say
ye
unto
your
brethren
ammi
and
to
your
sisters
ruhamah
2
2
plead
with
your
mother
plead
for
she
is
not
my
wife
neither
am
i
her
husband
let
her
therefore
put
away
her
whoredoms
out
of
her
sight
and
her
adulteries
from
between
her
breasts
2
3
lest
i
strip
her
naked
and
set
her
as
in
the
day
that
she
was
born
and
make
her
as
a
wilderness
and
set
her
like
a
dry
land
and
slay
her
with
thirst
2
4
and
i
will
not
have
mercy
upon
her
children
for
they
be
the
children
of
whoredoms
2
5
for
their
mother
hath
played
the
harlot
she
that
conceived
them
hath
done
shamefully
for
she
said
i
will
go
after
my
lovers
that
give
me
my
bread
and
my
water
my
wool
and
my
flax
mine
oil
and
my
drink
2
6
therefore
behold
i
will
hedge
up
thy
way
with
thorns
and
make
a
wall
that
she
shall
not
find
her
paths
2
7
and
she
shall
follow
after
her
lovers
but
she
shall
not
overtake
them
and
she
shall
seek
them
but
shall
not
find
them
then
shall
she
say
i
will
go
and
return
to
my
first
husband
for
then
was
it
better
with
me
than
now
2
8
for
she
did
not
know
that
i
gave
her
corn
and
wine
and
oil
and
multiplied
her
silver
and
gold
which
they
prepared
for
baal
2
9
therefore
will
i
return
and
take
away
my
corn
in
the
time
thereof
and
my
wine
in
the
season
thereof
and
will
recover
my
wool
and
my
flax
given
to
cover
her
nakedness
2
10
and
now
will
i
discover
her
lewdness
in
the
sight
of
her
lovers
and
none
shall
deliver
her
out
of
mine
hand
2
11
i
will
also
cause
all
her
mirth
to
cease
her
feast
days
her
new
moons
and
her
sabbaths
and
all
her
solemn
feasts
2
12
and
i
will
destroy
her
vines
and
her
fig
trees
whereof
she
hath
said
these
are
my
rewards
that
my
lovers
have
given
me
and
i
will
make
them
a
forest
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
eat
them
2
13
and
i
will
visit
upon
her
the
days
of
baalim
wherein
she
burned
incense
to
them
and
she
decked
herself
with
her
earrings
and
her
jewels
and
she
went
after
her
lovers
and
forgat
me
saith
the
lord
2
14
therefore
behold
i
will
allure
her
and
bring
her
into
the
wilderness
and
speak
comfortably
unto
her
2
15
and
i
will
give
her
her
vineyards
from
thence
and
the
valley
of
achor
for
a
door
of
hope
and
she
shall
sing
there
as
in
the
days
of
her
youth
and
as
in
the
day
when
she
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
2
16
and
it
shall
be
at
that
day
saith
the
lord
that
thou
shalt
call
me
ishi
and
shalt
call
me
no
more
baali
2
17
for
i
will
take
away
the
names
of
baalim
out
of
her
mouth
and
they
shall
no
more
be
remembered
by
their
name
2
18
and
in
that
day
will
i
make
a
covenant
for
them
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
with
the
fowls
of
heaven
and
with
the
creeping
things
of
the
ground
and
i
will
break
the
bow
and
the
sword
and
the
battle
out
of
the
earth
and
will
make
them
to
lie
down
safely
2
19
and
i
will
betroth
thee
unto
me
for
ever
yea
i
will
betroth
thee
unto
me
in
righteousness
and
in
judgment
and
in
lovingkindness
and
in
mercies
2
20
i
will
even
betroth
thee
unto
me
in
faithfulness
and
thou
shalt
know
the
lord
2
21
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
i
will
hear
saith
the
lord
i
will
hear
the
heavens
and
they
shall
hear
the
earth
2
22
and
the
earth
shall
hear
the
corn
and
the
wine
and
the
oil
and
they
shall
hear
jezreel
2
23
and
i
will
sow
her
unto
me
in
the
earth
and
i
will
have
mercy
upon
her
that
had
not
obtained
mercy
and
i
will
say
to
them
which
were
not
my
people
thou
art
my
people
and
they
shall
say
thou
art
my
god
3
1
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
go
yet
love
a
woman
beloved
of
her
friend
yet
an
adulteress
according
to
the
love
of
the
lord
toward
the
children
of
israel
who
look
to
other
gods
and
love
flagons
of
wine
3
2
so
i
bought
her
to
me
for
fifteen
pieces
of
silver
and
for
an
homer
of
barley
and
an
half
homer
of
barley
3
3
and
i
said
unto
her
thou
shalt
abide
for
me
many
days
thou
shalt
not
play
the
harlot
and
thou
shalt
not
be
for
another
man
so
will
i
also
be
for
thee
3
4
for
the
children
of
israel
shall
abide
many
days
without
a
king
and
without
a
prince
and
without
a
sacrifice
and
without
an
image
and
without
an
ephod
and
without
teraphim
3
5
afterward
shall
the
children
of
israel
return
and
seek
the
lord
their
god
and
david
their
king
and
shall
fear
the
lord
and
his
goodness
in
the
latter
days
4
1
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
children
of
israel
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
because
there
is
no
truth
nor
mercy
nor
knowledge
of
god
in
the
land
4
2
by
swearing
and
lying
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
they
break
out
and
blood
toucheth
blood
4
3
therefore
shall
the
land
mourn
and
every
one
that
dwelleth
therein
shall
languish
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
with
the
fowls
of
heaven
yea
the
fishes
of
the
sea
also
shall
be
taken
away
4
4
yet
let
no
man
strive
nor
reprove
another
for
thy
people
are
as
they
that
strive
with
the
priest
4
5
therefore
shalt
thou
fall
in
the
day
and
the
prophet
also
shall
fall
with
thee
in
the
night
and
i
will
destroy
thy
mother
4
6
my
people
are
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
because
thou
hast
rejected
knowledge
i
will
also
reject
thee
that
thou
shalt
be
no
priest
to
me
seeing
thou
hast
forgotten
the
law
of
thy
god
i
will
also
forget
thy
children
4
7
as
they
were
increased
so
they
sinned
against
me
therefore
will
i
change
their
glory
into
shame
4
8
they
eat
up
the
sin
of
my
people
and
they
set
their
heart
on
their
iniquity
4
9
and
there
shall
be
like
people
like
priest
and
i
will
punish
them
for
their
ways
and
reward
them
their
doings
4
10
for
they
shall
eat
and
not
have
enough
they
shall
commit
whoredom
and
shall
not
increase
because
they
have
left
off
to
take
heed
to
the
lord
4
11
whoredom
and
wine
and
new
wine
take
away
the
heart
4
12
my
people
ask
counsel
at
their
stocks
and
their
staff
declareth
unto
them
for
the
spirit
of
whoredoms
hath
caused
them
to
err
and
they
have
gone
a
whoring
from
under
their
god
4
13
they
sacrifice
upon
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
burn
incense
upon
the
hills
under
oaks
and
poplars
and
elms
because
the
shadow
thereof
is
good
therefore
your
daughters
shall
commit
whoredom
and
your
spouses
shall
commit
adultery
4
14
i
will
not
punish
your
daughters
when
they
commit
whoredom
nor
your
spouses
when
they
commit
adultery
for
themselves
are
separated
with
whores
and
they
sacrifice
with
harlots
therefore
the
people
that
doth
not
understand
shall
fall
4
15
though
thou
israel
play
the
harlot
yet
let
not
judah
offend
and
come
not
ye
unto
gilgal
neither
go
ye
up
to
bethaven
nor
swear
the
lord
liveth
4
16
for
israel
slideth
back
as
a
backsliding
heifer
now
the
lord
will
feed
them
as
a
lamb
in
a
large
place
4
17
ephraim
is
joined
to
idols
let
him
alone
4
18
their
drink
is
sour
they
have
committed
whoredom
continually
her
rulers
with
shame
do
love
give
ye
4
19
the
wind
hath
bound
her
up
in
her
wings
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
because
of
their
sacrifices
5
1
hear
ye
this
o
priests
and
hearken
ye
house
of
israel
and
give
ye
ear
o
house
of
the
king
for
judgment
is
toward
you
because
ye
have
been
a
snare
on
mizpah
and
a
net
spread
upon
tabor
5
2
and
the
revolters
are
profound
to
make
slaughter
though
i
have
been
a
rebuker
of
them
all
5
3
i
know
ephraim
and
israel
is
not
hid
from
me
for
now
o
ephraim
thou
committest
whoredom
and
israel
is
defiled
5
4
they
will
not
frame
their
doings
to
turn
unto
their
god
for
the
spirit
of
whoredoms
is
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
have
not
known
the
lord
5
5
and
the
pride
of
israel
doth
testify
to
his
face
therefore
shall
israel
and
ephraim
fall
in
their
iniquity
judah
also
shall
fall
with
them
5
6
they
shall
go
with
their
flocks
and
with
their
herds
to
seek
the
lord
but
they
shall
not
find
him
he
hath
withdrawn
himself
from
them
5
7
they
have
dealt
treacherously
against
the
lord
for
they
have
begotten
strange
children
now
shall
a
month
devour
them
with
their
portions
5
8
blow
ye
the
cornet
in
gibeah
and
the
trumpet
in
ramah
cry
aloud
at
bethaven
after
thee
o
benjamin
5
9
ephraim
shall
be
desolate
in
the
day
of
rebuke
among
the
tribes
of
israel
have
i
made
known
that
which
shall
surely
be
5
10
the
princes
of
judah
were
like
them
that
remove
the
bound
therefore
i
will
pour
out
my
wrath
upon
them
like
water
5
11
ephraim
is
oppressed
and
broken
in
judgment
because
he
willingly
walked
after
the
commandment
5
12
therefore
will
i
be
unto
ephraim
as
a
moth
and
to
the
house
of
judah
as
rottenness
5
13
when
ephraim
saw
his
sickness
and
judah
saw
his
wound
then
went
ephraim
to
the
assyrian
and
sent
to
king
jareb
yet
could
he
not
heal
you
nor
cure
you
of
your
wound
5
14
for
i
will
be
unto
ephraim
as
a
lion
and
as
a
young
lion
to
the
house
of
judah
i
even
i
will
tear
and
go
away
i
will
take
away
and
none
shall
rescue
him
5
15
i
will
go
and
return
to
my
place
till
they
acknowledge
their
offence
and
seek
my
face
in
their
affliction
they
will
seek
me
early
6
1
come
and
let
us
return
unto
the
lord
for
he
hath
torn
and
he
will
heal
us
he
hath
smitten
and
he
will
bind
us
up
6
2
after
two
days
will
he
revive
us
in
the
third
day
he
will
raise
us
up
and
we
shall
live
in
his
sight
6
3
then
shall
we
know
if
we
follow
on
to
know
the
lord
his
going
forth
is
prepared
as
the
morning
and
he
shall
come
unto
us
as
the
rain
as
the
latter
and
former
rain
unto
the
earth
6
4
o
ephraim
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
o
judah
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
for
your
goodness
is
as
a
morning
cloud
and
as
the
early
dew
it
goeth
away
6
5
therefore
have
i
hewed
them
by
the
prophets
i
have
slain
them
by
the
words
of
my
mouth
and
thy
judgments
are
as
the
light
that
goeth
forth
6
6
for
i
desired
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
and
the
knowledge
of
god
more
than
burnt
offerings
6
7
but
they
like
men
have
transgressed
the
covenant
there
have
they
dealt
treacherously
against
me
6
8
gilead
is
a
city
of
them
that
work
iniquity
and
is
polluted
with
blood
6
9
and
as
troops
of
robbers
wait
for
a
man
so
the
company
of
priests
murder
in
the
way
by
consent
for
they
commit
lewdness
6
10
i
have
seen
an
horrible
thing
in
the
house
of
israel
there
is
the
whoredom
of
ephraim
israel
is
defiled
6
11
also
o
judah
he
hath
set
an
harvest
for
thee
when
i
returned
the
captivity
of
my
people
7
1
when
i
would
have
healed
israel
then
the
iniquity
of
ephraim
was
discovered
and
the
wickedness
of
samaria
for
they
commit
falsehood
and
the
thief
cometh
in
and
the
troop
of
robbers
spoileth
without
7
2
and
they
consider
not
in
their
hearts
that
i
remember
all
their
wickedness
now
their
own
doings
have
beset
them
about
they
are
before
my
face
7
3
they
make
the
king
glad
with
their
wickedness
and
the
princes
with
their
lies
7
4
they
are
all
adulterers
as
an
oven
heated
by
the
baker
who
ceaseth
from
raising
after
he
hath
kneaded
the
dough
until
it
be
leavened
7
5
in
the
day
of
our
king
the
princes
have
made
him
sick
with
bottles
of
wine
he
stretched
out
his
hand
with
scorners
7
6
for
they
have
made
ready
their
heart
like
an
oven
whiles
they
lie
in
wait
their
baker
sleepeth
all
the
night
in
the
morning
it
burneth
as
a
flaming
fire
7
7
they
are
all
hot
as
an
oven
and
have
devoured
their
judges
all
their
kings
are
fallen
there
is
none
among
them
that
calleth
unto
me
7
8
ephraim
he
hath
mixed
himself
among
the
people
ephraim
is
a
cake
not
turned
7
9
strangers
have
devoured
his
strength
and
he
knoweth
it
not
yea
gray
hairs
are
here
and
there
upon
him
yet
he
knoweth
not
7
10
and
the
pride
of
israel
testifieth
to
his
face
and
they
do
not
return
to
the
lord
their
god
nor
seek
him
for
all
this
7
11
ephraim
also
is
like
a
silly
dove
without
heart
they
call
to
egypt
they
go
to
assyria
7
12
when
they
shall
go
i
will
spread
my
net
upon
them
i
will
bring
them
down
as
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
i
will
chastise
them
as
their
congregation
hath
heard
7
13
woe
unto
them
for
they
have
fled
from
me
destruction
unto
them
because
they
have
transgressed
against
me
though
i
have
redeemed
them
yet
they
have
spoken
lies
against
me
7
14
and
they
have
not
cried
unto
me
with
their
heart
when
they
howled
upon
their
beds
they
assemble
themselves
for
corn
and
wine
and
they
rebel
against
me
7
15
though
i
have
bound
and
strengthened
their
arms
yet
do
they
imagine
mischief
against
me
7
16
they
return
but
not
to
the
most
high
they
are
like
a
deceitful
bow
their
princes
shall
fall
by
the
sword
for
the
rage
of
their
tongue
this
shall
be
their
derision
in
the
land
of
egypt
8
1
set
the
trumpet
to
thy
mouth
he
shall
come
as
an
eagle
against
the
house
of
the
lord
because
they
have
transgressed
my
covenant
and
trespassed
against
my
law
8
2
israel
shall
cry
unto
me
my
god
we
know
thee
8
3
israel
hath
cast
off
the
thing
that
is
good
the
enemy
shall
pursue
him
8
4
they
have
set
up
kings
but
not
by
me
they
have
made
princes
and
i
knew
it
not
of
their
silver
and
their
gold
have
they
made
them
idols
that
they
may
be
cut
off
8
5
thy
calf
o
samaria
hath
cast
thee
off
mine
anger
is
kindled
against
them
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
attain
to
innocency
8
6
for
from
israel
was
it
also
the
workman
made
it
therefore
it
is
not
god
but
the
calf
of
samaria
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
8
7
for
they
have
sown
the
wind
and
they
shall
reap
the
whirlwind
it
hath
no
stalk
the
bud
shall
yield
no
meal
if
so
be
it
yield
the
strangers
shall
swallow
it
up
8
8
israel
is
swallowed
up
now
shall
they
be
among
the
gentiles
as
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
8
9
for
they
are
gone
up
to
assyria
a
wild
ass
alone
by
himself
ephraim
hath
hired
lovers
8
10
yea
though
they
have
hired
among
the
nations
now
will
i
gather
them
and
they
shall
sorrow
a
little
for
the
burden
of
the
king
of
princes
8
11
because
ephraim
hath
made
many
altars
to
sin
altars
shall
be
unto
him
to
sin
8
12
i
have
written
to
him
the
great
things
of
my
law
but
they
were
counted
as
a
strange
thing
8
13
they
sacrifice
flesh
for
the
sacrifices
of
mine
offerings
and
eat
it
but
the
lord
accepteth
them
not
now
will
he
remember
their
iniquity
and
visit
their
sins
they
shall
return
to
egypt
8
14
for
israel
hath
forgotten
his
maker
and
buildeth
temples
and
judah
hath
multiplied
fenced
cities
but
i
will
send
a
fire
upon
his
cities
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
thereof
9
1
rejoice
not
o
israel
for
joy
as
other
people
for
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
from
thy
god
thou
hast
loved
a
reward
upon
every
cornfloor
9
2
the
floor
and
the
winepress
shall
not
feed
them
and
the
new
wine
shall
fail
in
her
9
3
they
shall
not
dwell
in
the
lord’s
land
but
ephraim
shall
return
to
egypt
and
they
shall
eat
unclean
things
in
assyria
9
4
they
shall
not
offer
wine
offerings
to
the
lord
neither
shall
they
be
pleasing
unto
him
their
sacrifices
shall
be
unto
them
as
the
bread
of
mourners
all
that
eat
thereof
shall
be
polluted
for
their
bread
for
their
soul
shall
not
come
into
the
house
of
the
lord
9
5
what
will
ye
do
in
the
solemn
day
and
in
the
day
of
the
feast
of
the
lord
9
6
for
lo
they
are
gone
because
of
destruction
egypt
shall
gather
them
up
memphis
shall
bury
them
the
pleasant
places
for
their
silver
nettles
shall
possess
them
thorns
shall
be
in
their
tabernacles
9
7
the
days
of
visitation
are
come
the
days
of
recompence
are
come
israel
shall
know
it
the
prophet
is
a
fool
the
spiritual
man
is
mad
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
and
the
great
hatred
9
8
the
watchman
of
ephraim
was
with
my
god
but
the
prophet
is
a
snare
of
a
fowler
in
all
his
ways
and
hatred
in
the
house
of
his
god
9
9
they
have
deeply
corrupted
themselves
as
in
the
days
of
gibeah
therefore
he
will
remember
their
iniquity
he
will
visit
their
sins
9
10
i
found
israel
like
grapes
in
the
wilderness
i
saw
your
fathers
as
the
firstripe
in
the
fig
tree
at
her
first
time
but
they
went
to
baalpeor
and
separated
themselves
unto
that
shame
and
their
abominations
were
according
as
they
loved
9
11
as
for
ephraim
their
glory
shall
fly
away
like
a
bird
from
the
birth
and
from
the
womb
and
from
the
conception
9
12
though
they
bring
up
their
children
yet
will
i
bereave
them
that
there
shall
not
be
a
man
left
yea
woe
also
to
them
when
i
depart
from
them
9
13
ephraim
as
i
saw
tyrus
is
planted
in
a
pleasant
place
but
ephraim
shall
bring
forth
his
children
to
the
murderer
9
14
give
them
o
lord
what
wilt
thou
give
give
them
a
miscarrying
womb
and
dry
breasts
9
15
all
their
wickedness
is
in
gilgal
for
there
i
hated
them
for
the
wickedness
of
their
doings
i
will
drive
them
out
of
mine
house
i
will
love
them
no
more
all
their
princes
are
revolters
9
16
ephraim
is
smitten
their
root
is
dried
up
they
shall
bear
no
fruit
yea
though
they
bring
forth
yet
will
i
slay
even
the
beloved
fruit
of
their
womb
9
17
my
god
will
cast
them
away
because
they
did
not
hearken
unto
him
and
they
shall
be
wanderers
among
the
nations
10
1
israel
is
an
empty
vine
he
bringeth
forth
fruit
unto
himself
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
fruit
he
hath
increased
the
altars
according
to
the
goodness
of
his
land
they
have
made
goodly
images
10
2
their
heart
is
divided
now
shall
they
be
found
faulty
he
shall
break
down
their
altars
he
shall
spoil
their
images
10
3
for
now
they
shall
say
we
have
no
king
because
we
feared
not
the
lord
what
then
should
a
king
do
to
us
10
4
they
have
spoken
words
swearing
falsely
in
making
a
covenant
thus
judgment
springeth
up
as
hemlock
in
the
furrows
of
the
field
10
5
the
inhabitants
of
samaria
shall
fear
because
of
the
calves
of
bethaven
for
the
people
thereof
shall
mourn
over
it
and
the
priests
thereof
that
rejoiced
on
it
for
the
glory
thereof
because
it
is
departed
from
it
10
6
it
shall
be
also
carried
unto
assyria
for
a
present
to
king
jareb
ephraim
shall
receive
shame
and
israel
shall
be
ashamed
of
his
own
counsel
10
7
as
for
samaria
her
king
is
cut
off
as
the
foam
upon
the
water
10
8
the
high
places
also
of
aven
the
sin
of
israel
shall
be
destroyed
the
thorn
and
the
thistle
shall
come
up
on
their
altars
and
they
shall
say
to
the
mountains
cover
us
and
to
the
hills
fall
on
us
10
9
o
israel
thou
hast
sinned
from
the
days
of
gibeah
there
they
stood
the
battle
in
gibeah
against
the
children
of
iniquity
did
not
overtake
them
10
10
it
is
in
my
desire
that
i
should
chastise
them
and
the
people
shall
be
gathered
against
them
when
they
shall
bind
themselves
in
their
two
furrows
10
11
and
ephraim
is
as
an
heifer
that
is
taught
and
loveth
to
tread
out
the
corn
but
i
passed
over
upon
her
fair
neck
i
will
make
ephraim
to
ride
judah
shall
plow
and
jacob
shall
break
his
clods
10
12
sow
to
yourselves
in
righteousness
reap
in
mercy
break
up
your
fallow
ground
for
it
is
time
to
seek
the
lord
till
he
come
and
rain
righteousness
upon
you
10
13
ye
have
plowed
wickedness
ye
have
reaped
iniquity
ye
have
eaten
the
fruit
of
lies
because
thou
didst
trust
in
thy
way
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mighty
men
10
14
therefore
shall
a
tumult
arise
among
thy
people
and
all
thy
fortresses
shall
be
spoiled
as
shalman
spoiled
betharbel
in
the
day
of
battle
the
mother
was
dashed
in
pieces
upon
her
children
10
15
so
shall
bethel
do
unto
you
because
of
your
great
wickedness
in
a
morning
shall
the
king
of
israel
utterly
be
cut
off
11
1
when
israel
was
a
child
then
i
loved
him
and
called
my
son
out
of
egypt
11
2
as
they
called
them
so
they
went
from
them
they
sacrificed
unto
baalim
and
burned
incense
to
graven
images
11
3
i
taught
ephraim
also
to
go
taking
them
by
their
arms
but
they
knew
not
that
i
healed
them
11
4
i
drew
them
with
cords
of
a
man
with
bands
of
love
and
i
was
to
them
as
they
that
take
off
the
yoke
on
their
jaws
and
i
laid
meat
unto
them
11
5
he
shall
not
return
into
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
assyrian
shall
be
his
king
because
they
refused
to
return
11
6
and
the
sword
shall
abide
on
his
cities
and
shall
consume
his
branches
and
devour
them
because
of
their
own
counsels
11
7
and
my
people
are
bent
to
backsliding
from
me
though
they
called
them
to
the
most
high
none
at
all
would
exalt
him
11
8
how
shall
i
give
thee
up
ephraim
how
shall
i
deliver
thee
israel
how
shall
i
make
thee
as
admah
how
shall
i
set
thee
as
zeboim
mine
heart
is
turned
within
me
my
repentings
are
kindled
together
11
9
i
will
not
execute
the
fierceness
of
mine
anger
i
will
not
return
to
destroy
ephraim
for
i
am
god
and
not
man
the
holy
one
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
i
will
not
enter
into
the
city
11
10
they
shall
walk
after
the
lord
he
shall
roar
like
a
lion
when
he
shall
roar
then
the
children
shall
tremble
from
the
west
11
11
they
shall
tremble
as
a
bird
out
of
egypt
and
as
a
dove
out
of
the
land
of
assyria
and
i
will
place
them
in
their
houses
saith
the
lord
11
12
ephraim
compasseth
me
about
with
lies
and
the
house
of
israel
with
deceit
but
judah
yet
ruleth
with
god
and
is
faithful
with
the
saints
12
1
ephraim
feedeth
on
wind
and
followeth
after
the
east
wind
he
daily
increaseth
lies
and
desolation
and
they
do
make
a
covenant
with
the
assyrians
and
oil
is
carried
into
egypt
12
2
the
lord
hath
also
a
controversy
with
judah
and
will
punish
jacob
according
to
his
ways
according
to
his
doings
will
he
recompense
him
12
3
he
took
his
brother
by
the
heel
in
the
womb
and
by
his
strength
he
had
power
with
god
12
4
yea
he
had
power
over
the
angel
and
prevailed
he
wept
and
made
supplication
unto
him
he
found
him
in
bethel
and
there
he
spake
with
us
12
5
even
the
lord
god
of
hosts
the
lord
is
his
memorial
12
6
therefore
turn
thou
to
thy
god
keep
mercy
and
judgment
and
wait
on
thy
god
continually
12
7
he
is
a
merchant
the
balances
of
deceit
are
in
his
hand
he
loveth
to
oppress
12
8
and
ephraim
said
yet
i
am
become
rich
i
have
found
me
out
substance
in
all
my
labours
they
shall
find
none
iniquity
in
me
that
were
sin
12
9
and
i
that
am
the
lord
thy
god
from
the
land
of
egypt
will
yet
make
thee
to
dwell
in
tabernacles
as
in
the
days
of
the
solemn
feast
12
10
i
have
also
spoken
by
the
prophets
and
i
have
multiplied
visions
and
used
similitudes
by
the
ministry
of
the
prophets
12
11
is
there
iniquity
in
gilead
surely
they
are
vanity
they
sacrifice
bullocks
in
gilgal
yea
their
altars
are
as
heaps
in
the
furrows
of
the
fields
12
12
and
jacob
fled
into
the
country
of
syria
and
israel
served
for
a
wife
and
for
a
wife
he
kept
sheep
12
13
and
by
a
prophet
the
lord
brought
israel
out
of
egypt
and
by
a
prophet
was
he
preserved
12
14
ephraim
provoked
him
to
anger
most
bitterly
therefore
shall
he
leave
his
blood
upon
him
and
his
reproach
shall
his
lord
return
unto
him
13
1
when
ephraim
spake
trembling
he
exalted
himself
in
israel
but
when
he
offended
in
baal
he
died
13
2
and
now
they
sin
more
and
more
and
have
made
them
molten
images
of
their
silver
and
idols
according
to
their
own
understanding
all
of
it
the
work
of
the
craftsmen
they
say
of
them
let
the
men
that
sacrifice
kiss
the
calves
13
3
therefore
they
shall
be
as
the
morning
cloud
and
as
the
early
dew
that
passeth
away
as
the
chaff
that
is
driven
with
the
whirlwind
out
of
the
floor
and
as
the
smoke
out
of
the
chimney
13
4
yet
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
thou
shalt
know
no
god
but
me
for
there
is
no
saviour
beside
me
13
5
i
did
know
thee
in
the
wilderness
in
the
land
of
great
drought
13
6
according
to
their
pasture
so
were
they
filled
they
were
filled
and
their
heart
was
exalted
therefore
have
they
forgotten
me
13
7
therefore
i
will
be
unto
them
as
a
lion
as
a
leopard
by
the
way
will
i
observe
them
13
8
i
will
meet
them
as
a
bear
that
is
bereaved
of
her
whelps
and
will
rend
the
caul
of
their
heart
and
there
will
i
devour
them
like
a
lion
the
wild
beast
shall
tear
them
13
9
o
israel
thou
hast
destroyed
thyself
but
in
me
is
thine
help
13
10
i
will
be
thy
king
where
is
any
other
that
may
save
thee
in
all
thy
cities
and
thy
judges
of
whom
thou
saidst
give
me
a
king
and
princes
13
11
i
gave
thee
a
king
in
mine
anger
and
took
him
away
in
my
wrath
13
12
the
iniquity
of
ephraim
is
bound
up
his
sin
is
hid
13
13
the
sorrows
of
a
travailing
woman
shall
come
upon
him
he
is
an
unwise
son
for
he
should
not
stay
long
in
the
place
of
the
breaking
forth
of
children
13
14
i
will
ransom
them
from
the
power
of
the
grave
i
will
redeem
them
from
death
o
death
i
will
be
thy
plagues
o
grave
i
will
be
thy
destruction
repentance
shall
be
hid
from
mine
eyes
13
15
though
he
be
fruitful
among
his
brethren
an
east
wind
shall
come
the
wind
of
the
lord
shall
come
up
from
the
wilderness
and
his
spring
shall
become
dry
and
his
fountain
shall
be
dried
up
he
shall
spoil
the
treasure
of
all
pleasant
vessels
13
16
samaria
shall
become
desolate
for
she
hath
rebelled
against
her
god
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
their
infants
shall
be
dashed
in
pieces
and
their
women
with
child
shall
be
ripped
up
14
1
o
israel
return
unto
the
lord
thy
god
for
thou
hast
fallen
by
thine
iniquity
14

take
with
you
words
and

14

their
backsliding

love
them
freely
for

turned
away
from

shall
grow
as
the
lily
and

forth
his

blow
ye
the
trumpet
in
zion
and
sound
an
alarm
in
my
holy
mountain
let
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
tremble
for
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
for
it
is
nigh
at
hand
2
2
a
day
of
darkness
and
of
gloominess
a
day
of
clouds
and
of
thick
darkness
as
the
morning
spread
upon
the
mountains
a
great
people
and
a
strong
there
hath
not
been
ever
the
like
neither
shall
be
any
more
after
it
even
to
the
years
of
many
generations
2

a
fire
devoureth
before
them
and
behind
them
a
flame
burneth
the
land
is
as
the
garden
of
eden
before
them
and
behind
them
a
desolate
wilderness
yea
and
nothing
shall
escape
them
2
4
the
appearance
of
them
is
as
the
appearance
of
horses
and
as
horsemen
so
shall
they
run
2
5
like
the
noise
of
chariots
on
the
tops
of
mountains
shall
they
leap
like
the
noise
of
a
flame
of
fire
that
devoureth
the
stubble
as
a
strong
people
set
in
battle
array
2
6
before
their
face
the
people
shall
be
much
pained
all
faces
shall
gather
blackness
2
7
they
shall
run
like
mighty
men
they
shall
climb
the
wall
like
men
of
war
and
they
shall
march
every
one
on
his
ways
and
they
shall
not
break
their
ranks
2
8
neither
shall
one
thrust
another
they
shall
walk
every
one
in
his
path
and
when
they
fall
upon
the
sword
they
shall
not
be
wounded
2
9
they
shall
run
to
and
fro
in
the
city
they
shall
run
upon
the
wall
they
shall
climb
up
upon
the
houses
they
shall
enter
in
at
the
windows
like
a
thief
2
10
the
earth
shall
quake
before
them
the
heavens
shall
tremble
the
sun
and
the
moon
shall
be
dark
and
the
stars
shall
withdraw
their
shining
2
11
and
the
lord
shall
utter
his
voice
before
his
army
for
his
camp
is
very
great
for
he
is
strong
that
executeth
his
word
for
the
day
of
the
lord
is
great
and
very
terrible
and
who
can
abide
it
2
12
therefore
also
now
saith
the
lord
turn
ye
even
to
me
with
all
your
heart
and
with
fasting
and
with
weeping
and
with
mourning
2
13
and
rend
your
heart
and
not
your
garments
and
turn
unto
the
lord
your
god
for
he
is
gracious
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
repenteth
him
of
the
evil
2
14
who
knoweth
if
he
will
return
and
repent
and
leave
a
blessing
behind
him
even
a
meat
offering
and
a
drink
offering
unto
the
lord
your
god
2
15
blow

let

bridegroom
go
forth
of
his
chamber
and

bride
out
of
her
closet
2
17
let
the
priests
the
ministers
of
the
lord
weep
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
and
let
them
say
spare
thy
people
o
lord
and
give
not
thine
heritage
to
reproach
that
the
heathen
should
rule
over
them
wherefore
should
they
say
among
the
people
where
is
their
god
2
18
then
will
the
lord
be
jealous
for
his
land
and
pity
his
people
2
19
yea
the
lord
will
answer
and
say
unto
his
people
behold
i
will
send
you
corn
and
wine
and
oil
and
ye
shall
be
satisfied
therewith
and
i
will
no
more
make
you
a
reproach
among
the
heathen
2
20
but
i
will
remove
far
off
from
you
the
northern
army
and
will
drive
him
into
a
land
barren
and
desolate
with
his
face
toward
the
east
sea
and
his
hinder
part
toward
the
utmost
sea
and
his
stink
shall
come

shall
come
up
because

hath
done
great
things

ye

beareth
her

the

2

be
glad

and
rejoice
in
the

shall
be
delivered
for
in

people
and
for
my
heritage
israel
whom
they
have
scattered
among
the
nations

and
if

me
swiftly
and
speedily
will
i
return
your
recompence
upon

carried
into
your
temples
my
goodly
pleasant
things
3

the

the
hand
of
the
children
of
judah

the

the

water
the

egypt
shall
be
a
desolation
and
edom
shall
be
a
desolate
wilderness
for
the
violence
against
the
children
of
judah
because
they
have
shed
innocent
blood
in

land
3

but
judah
shall
dwell
for

and
jerusalem
from
generation

among

concerning

days
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of

two
years
before

and
he
said
the

will
roar
from
zion
and
utter
his
voice
from
jerusalem
and
the
habitations
of
the
shepherds
shall
mourn
and
the

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
damascus
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
have
threshed
gilead
with

i

fire
into

him
that

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
gaza
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the

thereof
because
they
carried

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
tyrus
and
for
four
i
will
not

thereof
because
they

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of

for
four
i

anger
did
tear

saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
for
four
i
will
not

the
punishment
thereof

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
moab
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
he
burned
the
bones

i
will
send
a
fire
upon

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
judah
and
for
four
i

the
punishment
thereof

they
have
despised

not
kept

their
lies
caused
them
to
err
after

which

have
walked

i
will
send
a
fire
upon

it
shall
devour
the
palaces
of
jerusalem
2

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
israel
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
sold
the
righteous
for
silver
and
the
poor
for
a
pair
of
shoes
2
7
that
pant
after
the
dust
of
the
earth
on
the
head
of
the
poor
and
turn
aside
the
way
of
the
meek
and
a
man

his
father
will
go
in
unto
the
same
maid
to
profane
my
holy
name
2

and
they
lay
themselves
down
upon
clothes
laid
to
pledge
by
every
altar
and
they
drink
the
wine
of
the
condemned
in
the
house
of
their
god
2
9
yet
destroyed
i
the
amorite
before
them
whose
height
was
like
the
height
of
the
cedars
and
he
was
strong
as
the
oaks
yet
i
destroyed
his
fruit
from
above
and
his
roots
from
beneath
2
10
also
i
brought
you
up
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
led
you
forty
years
through
the
wilderness
to
possess
the
land
of
the
amorite
2
11
and
i
raised
up
of
your
sons
for
prophets
and
of
your
young
men
for
nazarites
is
it
not
even
thus
o
ye
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
2
12
but
ye
gave
the
nazarites
wine
to
drink
and
commanded
the
prophets
saying
prophesy
not
2
13
behold
i
am
pressed
under
you
as
a
cart
is
pressed
that
is
full
of
sheaves
2
14
therefore
the
flight
shall
perish
from
the
swift
and
the
strong
shall
not
strengthen
his
force
neither
shall
the
mighty
deliver
himself
2
15
neither
shall
he
stand
that
handleth
the
bow
and

that
is
swift
of
foot
shall
not
deliver
himself
neither
shall
he
that
rideth
the
horse
deliver
himself
2
16
and
he
that
is
courageous
among
the
mighty
shall
flee
away
naked
in
that
day
saith
the
lord

hear
this
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
against
you
o
children
of
israel
against
the
whole
family
which
i
brought
up
from
the
land
of
egypt
saying
3
2
you
only
have
i
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
therefore
i
will
punish
you
for
all
your
iniquities
3
3
can
two
walk
together
except
they
be
agreed
3
4
will
a
lion
roar
in
the
forest
when
he
hath
no
prey
will
a
young
lion
cry
out
of
his
den
if
he
have
taken
nothing
3
5
can
a
bird
fall
in
a
snare
upon
the
earth
where
no
gin
is
for
him
shall
one
take
up
a
snare
from

earth
and
have
taken
nothing
at
all
3

shall
a
trumpet
be
blown
in
the
city
and
the
people
not
be
afraid
shall
there
be
evil
in
a
city
and
the
lord
hath
not
done
it
3
7
surely
the
lord
god
will
do
nothing
but
he
revealeth
his
secret
unto
his
servants
the
prophets
3
8
the
lion
hath
roared
who

the

publish
in
the
palaces
at
ashdod
and
in
the
palaces
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
say
assemble
yourselves
upon
the
mountains
of
samaria
and
behold
the
great
tumults
in
the
midst
thereof
and
the
oppressed
in
the
midst
thereof
3
10
for
they
know
not
to
do
right
saith
the
lord
who
store
up
violence
and
robbery
in
their
palaces
3
11
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
an
adversary
there
shall
be
even
round
about
the
land
and
he
shall
bring
down
thy
strength
from
thee
and
thy
palaces
shall
be
spoiled
3
12
thus
saith
the
lord
as
the
shepherd
taketh
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lion
two
legs
or
a
piece
of
an
ear
so
shall
the
children
of
israel
be
taken
out
that
dwell
in
samaria
in
the
corner
of
a
bed
and
in
damascus
in
a
couch
3
13
hear
ye
and
testify
in
the
house
of
jacob
saith
the
lord
god
the
god
of
hosts
3
14
that
in
the
day
that
i
shall
visit
the
transgressions
of
israel
upon
him
i
will
also
visit
the
altars
of
bethel
and
the
horns
of
the
altar
shall
be
cut
off
and
fall
to
the
ground
3
15
and
i
will
smite
the
winter
house
with
the
summer
house
and
the
houses
of
ivory
shall
perish
and
the
great
houses
shall
have
an
end
saith
the
lord
4
1
hear
this
word
ye
kine
of
bashan
that
are
in
the
mountain
of
samaria
which
oppress
the
poor
which
crush
the
needy
which
say
to
their
masters
bring
and
let
us
drink
4
2
the
lord
god
hath
sworn
by
his
holiness
that
lo
the
days
shall
come
upon
you
that
he
will
take
you
away
with
hooks
and
your
posterity
with
fishhooks
4
3
and
ye
shall
go
out
at
the
breaches
every
cow
at
that
which
is
before
her
and
ye
shall
cast
them
into
the
palace
saith
the
lord
4
4
come
to
bethel
and
transgress
at
gilgal
multiply
transgression
and
bring
your
sacrifices
every
morning
and
your
tithes
after
three
years
4
5
and
offer
a
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
with
leaven
and
proclaim
and
publish
the
free
offerings
for
this
liketh
you
o
ye
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
4
6
and
i
also
have
given
you
cleanness
of
teeth
in
all
your
cities
and
want
of
bread
in
all
your
places
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
4
7
and
also
i
have
withholden
the
rain
from
you
when
there
were
yet
three
months
to
the
harvest
and
i
caused
it
to
rain
upon
one
city
and
caused
it
not
to
rain
upon
another
city
one
piece
was
rained
upon
and
the
piece
whereupon
it
rained
not
withered
4
8
so
two
or
three
cities
wandered
unto
one
city
to
drink
water
but
they
were
not
satisfied
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
4
9
i
have
smitten
you
with
blasting
and
mildew
when
your
gardens
and
your
vineyards
and
your
fig
trees
and
your
olive
trees
increased
the
palmerworm
devoured
them
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
4
10
i
have
sent
among
you
the
pestilence
after
the
manner
of
egypt
your
young
men
have
i
slain
with
the
sword
and
have
taken
away
your
horses
and
i
have
made
the
stink
of
your
camps
to
come
up
unto
your
nostrils
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
4
11
i
have
overthrown
some
of
you
as
god
overthrew
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
ye
were
as
a
firebrand
plucked
out
of
the
burning
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
4
12
therefore
thus
will
i
do
unto
thee
o
israel
and
because
i
will
do
this
unto
thee
prepare
to
meet
thy
god
o
israel
4
13
for
lo
he
that
formeth
the
mountains
and
createth
the
wind
and
declareth
unto
man
what
is
his
thought
that
maketh
the
morning
darkness
and
treadeth
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
is
his
name
5
1
hear
ye
this
word
which
i
take
up
against
you
even
a
lamentation
o
house
of
israel
5
2
the
virgin
of
israel
is
fallen
she
shall
no
more
rise
she
is
forsaken
upon
her
land
there
is
none
to
raise
her
up
5
3
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
city
that
went
out
by
a
thousand
shall
leave
an
hundred
and
that
which
went
forth
by
an
hundred
shall
leave
ten
to
the
house
of
israel
5
4
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
israel
seek
ye
me
and
ye
shall
live
5
5
but
seek
not
bethel
nor
enter
into
gilgal
and
pass
not
to
beersheba
for
gilgal
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
and
bethel
shall
come
to
nought
5
6
seek
the
lord
and
ye
shall
live
lest
he
break
out
like
fire
in
the
house
of
joseph
and
devour
it
and
there
be
none
to
quench
it
in
bethel
5
7
ye
who
turn
judgment
to
wormwood
and
leave
off
righteousness
in
the
earth
5
8
seek
him
that
maketh
the
seven
stars
and
orion
and
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night
that
calleth
for
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
poureth
them
out
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
the
lord
is
his
name
5
9
that
strengtheneth
the
spoiled
against
the
strong
so
that
the
spoiled
shall
come
against
the
fortress
5
10
they
hate
him
that
rebuketh
in
the
gate
and
they
abhor
him
that
speaketh
uprightly
5
11
forasmuch
therefore
as
your
treading
is
upon
the
poor
and
ye
take
from
him
burdens
of
wheat
ye
have
built
houses
of
hewn
stone
but
ye
shall
not
dwell
in
them
ye
have
planted
pleasant
vineyards
but
ye
shall
not
drink
wine
of
them
5
12
for
i
know
your
manifold
transgressions
and
your
mighty
sins
they
afflict
the
just
they
take
a
bribe
and
they
turn
aside
the
poor
in
the
gate
from
their
right
5
13
therefore
the
prudent
shall
keep
silence
in
that
time
for
it
is
an
evil
time
5
14
seek
good
and
not
evil
that
ye
may
live
and
so
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
shall
be
with
you
as
ye
have
spoken
5
15
hate
the
evil
and
love
the
good
and
establish
judgment
in
the
gate
it
may
be
that
the
lord
god
of
hosts
will
be
gracious
unto
the
remnant
of
joseph
5
16
therefore
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
lord
saith
thus
wailing
shall
be
in
all
streets
and
they
shall
say
in
all
the
highways
alas
alas
and
they
shall
call
the
husbandman
to
mourning
and
such
as
are
skilful
of
lamentation
to
wailing
5
17
and
in
all
vineyards
shall
be
wailing
for
i
will
pass
through
thee
saith
the
lord
5
18
woe
unto
you
that
desire
the
day
of
the
lord
to
what
end
is
it
for
you
the
day
of
the
lord
is
darkness
and
not
light
5
19
as
if
a
man
did
flee
from
a
lion
and
a
bear
met
him
or
went
into
the
house
and
leaned
his
hand
on
the
wall
and
a
serpent
bit
him
5
20
shall
not
the
day
of
the
lord
be
darkness
and
not
light
even
very
dark
and
no
brightness
in
it
5
21
i
hate
i
despise
your
feast
days
and
i
will
not
smell
in
your
solemn
assemblies
5
22
though
ye
offer
me
burnt
offerings
and
your
meat
offerings
i
will
not
accept
them
neither
will
i
regard
the
peace
offerings
of
your
fat
beasts
5
23
take
thou
away
from
me
the
noise
of
thy
songs
for
i
will
not
hear
the
melody
of
thy
viols
5
24
but
let
judgment
run
down
as
waters
and
righteousness
as
a
mighty
stream
5
25
have
ye
offered
unto
me
sacrifices
and
offerings
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
o
house
of
israel
5
26
but
ye
have
borne
the
tabernacle
of
your
moloch
and
chiun
your
images
the
star
of
your
god
which
ye
made
to
yourselves
5
27
therefore
will
i
cause
you
to
go
into
captivity
beyond
damascus
saith
the
lord
whose
name
is
the
god
of
hosts
6
1
woe
to
them
that
are
at
ease
in
zion
and
trust
in
the
mountain
of
samaria
which
are
named
chief
of
the
nations
to
whom
the
house
of
israel
came
6
2
pass
ye
unto
calneh
and
see
and
from
thence
go
ye
to
hamath
the
great
then
go
down
to
gath
of
the
philistines
be
they
better
than
these
kingdoms
or
their
border
greater
than
your
border
6
3
ye
that
put
far
away
the
evil
day
and
cause
the
seat
of
violence
to
come
near
6
4
that
lie
upon
beds
of
ivory
and
stretch
themselves
upon
their
couches
and
eat
the
lambs
out
of
the
flock
and
the
calves
out
of
the
midst
of
the
stall
6
5
that
chant
to
the
sound
of
the
viol
and
invent
to
themselves
instruments
of
musick
like
david
6
6
that
drink
wine
in
bowls
and
anoint
themselves
with
the
chief
ointments
but
they
are
not
grieved
for
the
affliction
of
joseph
6
7
therefore
now
shall
they
go
captive
with
the
first
that
go
captive
and
the
banquet
of
them
that
stretched
themselves
shall
be
removed
6
8
the
lord
god
hath
sworn
by
himself
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
i
abhor
the
excellency
of
jacob
and
hate
his
palaces
therefore
will
i
deliver
up
the
city
with
all
that
is
therein
6
9
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
there
remain
ten
men
in
one
house
that
they
shall
die
6
10
and
a
man’s
uncle
shall
take
him
up
and
he
that
burneth
him
to
bring
out
the
bones
out
of
the
house
and
shall
say
unto
him
that
is
by
the
sides
of
the
house
is
there
yet
any
with
thee
and
he
shall
say
no
then
shall
he
say
hold
thy
tongue
for
we
may
not
make
mention
of
the
name
of
the
lord
6
11
for
behold
the
lord
commandeth
and
he
will
smite
the
great
house
with
breaches
and
the
little
house
with
clefts
6
12
shall
horses
run
upon
the
rock
will
one
plow
there
with
oxen
for
ye
have
turned
judgment
into
gall
and
the
fruit
of
righteousness
into
hemlock
6
13
ye
which
rejoice
in
a
thing
of
nought
which
say
have
we
not
taken
to
us
horns
by
our
own
strength
6
14
but
behold
i
will
raise
up
against
you
a
nation
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
and
they
shall
afflict
you
from
the
entering
in
of
hemath
unto
the
river
of
the
wilderness
7
1
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
he
formed
grasshoppers
in
the
beginning
of
the
shooting
up
of
the
latter
growth
and
lo
it
was
the
latter
growth
after
the
king’s
mowings
7
2
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating
the
grass
of
the
land
then
i
said
o
lord
god
forgive
i
beseech
thee
by
whom
shall
jacob
arise
for
he
is
small
7
3
the
lord
repented
for
this
it
shall
not
be
saith
the
lord
7
4
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
the
lord
god
called
to
contend
by
fire
and
it
devoured
the
great
deep
and
did
eat
up
a
part
7
5
then
said
i
o
lord
god
cease
i
beseech
thee
by
whom
shall
jacob
arise
for
he
is
small
7
6
the
lord
repented
for
this
this
also
shall
not
be
saith
the
lord
god
7
7
thus
he
shewed
me
and
behold
the
lord
stood
upon
a
wall
made
by
a
plumbline
with
a
plumbline
in
his
hand
7
8
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
amos
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
a
plumbline
then
said
the
lord
behold
i
will
set
a
plumbline
in
the
midst
of
my
people
israel
i
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more
7
9
and
the
high
places
of
isaac
shall
be
desolate
and
the
sanctuaries
of
israel
shall
be
laid
waste
and
i
will
rise
against
the
house
of
jeroboam
with
the
sword
7
10
then
amaziah
the
priest
of
bethel
sent
to
jeroboam
king
of
israel
saying
amos
hath
conspired
against
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
israel
the
land
is
not
able
to
bear
all
his
words
7
11
for
thus
amos
saith
jeroboam
shall
die
by
the
sword
and
israel
shall
surely
be
led
away
captive
out
of
their
own
land
7
12
also
amaziah
said
unto
amos
o
thou
seer
go
flee
thee
away
into
the
land
of
judah
and
there
eat
bread
and
prophesy
there
7
13
but
prophesy
not
again
any
more
at
bethel
for
it
is
the
king’s
chapel
and
it
is
the
king’s
court
7
14
then
answered
amos
and
said
to
amaziah
i
was
no
prophet
neither
was
i
a
prophet’s
son
but
i
was
an
herdman
and
a
gatherer
of
sycomore
fruit
7
15
and
the
lord
took
me
as
i
followed
the
flock
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
prophesy
unto
my
people
israel
7
16
now
therefore
hear
thou
the
word
of
the
lord
thou
sayest
prophesy
not
against
israel
and
drop
not
thy
word
against
the
house
of
isaac
7
17
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
wife
shall
be
an
harlot
in
the
city
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
land
shall
be
divided
by
line
and
thou
shalt
die
in
a
polluted
land
and
israel
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
forth
of
his
land
8
1
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
a
basket
of
summer
fruit
8
2
and
he
said
amos
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
a
basket
of
summer
fruit
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
the
end
is
come
upon
my
people
of
israel
i
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more
8
3
and
the
songs
of
the
temple
shall
be
howlings
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
be
many
dead
bodies
in
every
place
they
shall

the

that
we
may

the
lord
hath
sworn
by
the
excellency
of
jacob
surely
i
will
never

any
of
their
works
8
8
shall
not
the
land
tremble
for
this
and
every
one
mourn
that
dwelleth
therein
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
as
a
flood
and
it
shall
be
cast
out
and
drowned
as
by
the
flood
of

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
god
that
i
will
cause
the
sun
to
go
down
at
noon
and
i
will
darken
the
earth
in
the
clear
day
8
10
and
i
will
turn
your
feasts
into
mourning
and
all
your
songs
into
lamentation
and
i
will
bring
up
sackcloth
upon
all
loins
and
baldness
upon
every
head
and
i
will
make
it
as
the
mourning
of
an
only
son
and
the
end
thereof
as
a
bitter
day
8
11
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
god
that
i
will
send
a
famine
in
the
land
not
a
famine
of
bread
nor
a
thirst
for
water
but
of
hearing
the
words
of
the
lord
8
12
and
they
shall
wander
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
north
even
to
the
east
they
shall
run
to
and
fro
to
seek
the
word
of
the
lord
and
shall
not
find
it
8
13
in
that
day
shall
the
fair
virgins
and
young
men
faint
for
thirst
8
14
they
that
swear
by
the
sin
of
samaria
and
say
thy
god
o
dan
liveth
and
the
manner
of
beersheba
liveth
even
they
shall
fall
and
never
rise
up
again
9
1
i
saw
the
lord
standing
upon
the
altar
and
he
said
smite
the
lintel
of
the
door
that
the
posts
may
shake
and
cut
them
in
the
head
all
of
them
and
i
will
slay
the
last
of
them
with
the
sword
he
that
fleeth
of
them
shall
not
flee
away
and
he
that
escapeth
of
them
shall
not
be
delivered
9
2
though
they
dig
into
hell
thence
shall
mine
hand
take
them
though
they
climb
up
to
heaven
thence
will
i
bring
them
down
9
3
and
though
they
hide
themselves
in
the
top
of
carmel
i
will
search
and
take
them
out
thence
and
though
they
be
hid
from
my
sight
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
thence
will
i
command
the
serpent
and
he
shall
bite
them
9
4
and
though
they
go
into
captivity
before
their
enemies
thence
will
i
command
the
sword
and
it
shall
slay
them
and
i
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
evil
and
not
for
good
9
5
and
the
lord
god
of
hosts
is
he
that
toucheth
the
land
and
it
shall
melt
and
all
that
dwell
therein
shall
mourn
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
like
a
flood
and
shall
be
drowned
as
by
the
flood
of
egypt
9

it
is
he
that
buildeth
his
stories
in
the
heaven
and
hath
founded
his
troop
in
the
earth
he
that
calleth
for

eyes
of
the
lord
god
are
upon
the
sinful
kingdom
and
i
will
destroy
it
from
off
the
face
of

saving
that
i
will
not
utterly
destroy
the
house
of
jacob

the
lord
9
9
for
lo
i
will
command
and
i
will
sift
the
house
of

among
all
nations
like

earth
9
10
all
the
sinners
of
my
people
shall
die
by
the
sword
which
say
the
evil
shall
not
overtake
nor
prevent
us
9
11
in
that
day
will
i
raise
up
the
tabernacle
of
david
that
is
fallen
and
close
up
the
breaches
thereof
and
i
will
raise
up

12
that

the
lord
that
doeth
this
9

behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
the
plowman
shall
overtake
the
reaper
and
the
treader
of
grapes
him
that
soweth
seed
and
the
mountains
shall
drop
sweet
wine
and
all
the
hills
shall
melt
9
14
and
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
my
people
of
israel
and
they
shall
build
the
waste
cities
and
inhabit
them
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards
and
drink
the
wine
thereof
they
shall
also
make
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
9
15
and
i
will
plant
them
upon
their
land
and
they
shall
no
more
be
pulled
up
out
of
their
land
which
i
have
given
them

the
vision
of
obadiah
thus
saith
the
lord
god
concerning
edom
we
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
lord
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
among
the
heathen
arise
ye
and
let
us
rise
up
against
her
in
battle
1

behold
i
have
made
thee
small
among
the
heathen
thou
art
greatly
despised
1
3
the
pride
of
thine
heart
hath
deceived
thee
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
whose
habitation
is
high
that
saith
in
his
heart
who
shall
bring
me
down
to
the
ground
1

though
thou
exalt
thyself
as
the
eagle
and
though
thou
set
thy
nest
among
the
stars
thence
will
i
bring
thee
down
saith
the
lord
1
5
if
thieves
came
to
thee
if
robbers
by
night
(how
art
thou
cut
off
)
would
they
not
have
stolen
till
they
had
enough
if
the
grapegatherers
came
to
thee
would
they
not
leave
some
grapes
1

how
are
the
things
of
esau
searched
out
how
are
his
hidden
things
sought
up
1
7
all
the
men
of
thy
confederacy
have
brought
thee
even
to
the
border
the
men
that
were
at
peace
with
thee
have
deceived
thee
and
prevailed
against
thee
they
that

thy
bread
have
laid
a
wound
under
thee
there
is
none

in
him
1

shall
i
not
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
even
destroy
the
wise
men
out
of
edom
and
understanding
out
of
the
mount
of
esau
1
9
and
thy
mighty
men
o
teman
shall
be
dismayed
to
the
end
that
every
one
of
the
mount
of
esau
may
be
cut
off
by
slaughter
1
10
for
thy
violence
against
thy
brother
jacob
shame
shall
cover
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
for
ever
1
11
in
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
on
the
other
side
in
the
day
that
the
strangers
carried
away
captive
his
forces
and
foreigners
entered
into
his
gates
and
cast
lots
upon
jerusalem
even
thou
wast
as
one
of
them
1
12
but
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
the
day
of
thy
brother
in
the
day
that
he
became
a
stranger
neither
shouldest
thou
have
rejoiced
over
the
children
of
judah
in
the
day
of
their
destruction
neither
shouldest
thou
have
spoken
proudly
in
the
day
of
distress
1
13
thou
shouldest
not
have
entered
into
the
gate
of
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
yea
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
their
affliction
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
nor
have
laid
hands
on
their
substance
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
1
14
neither
shouldest
thou
have
stood
in
the
crossway
to
cut
off
those
of
his
that
did
escape
neither
shouldest
thou
have
delivered
up
those
of
his
that
did
remain
in
the
day
of
distress
1
15
for
the
day
of
the
lord
is
near
upon
all
the
heathen
as
thou
hast
done
it
shall
be
done
unto
thee
thy
reward
shall
return
upon
thine
own
head
1
16
for
as
ye
have
drunk
upon
my
holy
mountain
so
shall
all
the
heathen
drink
continually
yea
they
shall
drink
and
they
shall
swallow
down
and
they
shall
be
as
though
they
had
not
been
1
17
but
upon
mount
zion
shall
be
deliverance
and
there
shall
be
holiness
and
the
house
of
jacob
shall
possess
their
possessions
1
18
and
the
house
of
jacob
shall
be
a
fire
and
the
house
of
joseph
a
flame
and
the
house
of
esau
for
stubble
and
they
shall
kindle
in
them
and
devour
them
and
there
shall
not
be
any
remaining
of
the
house
of
esau
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
1
19
and
they
of
the
south
shall
possess
the
mount
of
esau
and
they
of
the
plain
the
philistines
and
they
shall
possess
the
fields
of
ephraim
and
the
fields
of
samaria
and
benjamin
shall
possess
gilead
1
20
and
the
captivity
of
this
host
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
possess
that
of
the
canaanites
even
unto
zarephath
and
the
captivity
of
jerusalem
which
is
in
sepharad
shall
possess
the
cities
of
the
south
1
21
and
saviours
shall
come
up
on
mount
zion
to
judge
the
mount
of
esau
and
the
kingdom
shall
be
the
lord’s
jonah
1
1
now
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jonah
the
son
of
amittai
saying
1
2
arise
go
to
nineveh
that
great
city
and
cry
against
it
for
their
wickedness
is
come
up
before
me
1
3
but
jonah
rose
up
to
flee
unto
tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
went
down
to
joppa
and
he
found
a
ship
going
to
tarshish
so
he
paid
the
fare
thereof
and
went
down
into
it
to
go
with
them
unto
tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
1
4
but
the
lord
sent
out
a
great
wind
into
the
sea
and
there
was
a
mighty
tempest
in
the
sea
so
that
the
ship
was
like
to
be
broken
1
5
then
the
mariners
were
afraid
and
cried
every
man
unto
his
god
and
cast
forth
the
wares
that
were
in
the
ship
into
the
sea
to
lighten
it
of
them
but
jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
sides
of
the
ship
and
he
lay
and
was
fast
asleep
1
6
so
the
shipmaster
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise
call
upon
thy
god
if
so
be
that
god
will
think
upon
us
that
we
perish
not
1
7
and
they
said
every
one
to
his
fellow
come
and
let
us
cast
lots
that
we
may
know
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us
so
they
cast
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
jonah
1
8
then
said
they
unto
him
tell
us
we
pray
thee
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us
what
is
thine
occupation
and
whence
comest
thou
what
is
thy
country
and
of
what
people
art
thou
1
9
and
he
said
unto
them
i
am
an
hebrew
and
i
fear
the
lord
the
god
of
heaven
which
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
1
10
then
were
the
men
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
done
this
for
the
men
knew
that
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
because
he
had
told
them
1
11
then
said
they
unto
him
what
shall
we
do
unto
thee
that
the
sea
may
be
calm
unto
us
for
the
sea
wrought
and
was
tempestuous
1
12
and
he
said
unto
them
take
me
up
and
cast
me
forth
into
the
sea
so
shall
the
sea
be
calm
unto
you
for
i
know
that
for
my
sake
this
great
tempest
is
upon
you
1
13
nevertheless
the
men
rowed
hard
to
bring
it
to
the
land
but
they
could
not
for
the
sea
wrought
and
was
tempestuous
against
them
1
14
wherefore
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
we
beseech
thee
o
lord
we
beseech
thee
let
us
not
perish
for
this
man’s
life
and
lay
not
upon
us
innocent
blood
for
thou
o
lord
hast
done
as
it
pleased
thee
1
15
so
they
look
up
jonah
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
ceased
from
her
raging
1
16
then
the
men
feared
the
lord
exceedingly
and
offered
a
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
and
made
vows
1
17
now
the
lord
had
prepared
a
great
fish
to
swallow
up
jonah
and
jonah
was
in
the
belly
of
the
fish
three
days
and
three
nights
2
1
then
jonah
prayed
unto
the
lord
his
god
out
of
the
fish’s
belly
2
2
and
said
i
cried
by
reason
of
mine
affliction
unto
the
lord
and
he
heard
me
out
of
the
belly
of
hell
cried
i
and
thou
heardest
my
voice
2
3
for
thou
hadst
cast
me
into
the
deep
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
and
the
floods
compassed
me
about
all
thy
billows
and
thy
waves
passed
over
me
2
4
then
i
said
i
am
cast
out
of
thy
sight
yet
i
will
look
again
toward
thy
holy
temple
2
5
the
waters
compassed
me
about
even
to
the
soul
the
depth
closed
me
round
about
the
weeds
were
wrapped
about
my
head
2
6
i
went
down
to
the
bottoms
of
the
mountains
the
earth
with
her
bars
was
about
me
for
ever
yet
hast
thou
brought
up
my
life
from
corruption
o
lord
my
god
2
7
when
my
soul
fainted
within
me
i
remembered
the
lord
and
my
prayer
came
in
unto
thee
into
thine
holy
temple
2
8
they
that
observe
lying
vanities
forsake
their
own
mercy
2
9
but
i
will
sacrifice
unto
thee
with
the
voice
of
thanksgiving
i
will
pay
that
that
i
have
vowed
salvation
is
of
the
lord
2
10
and
the
lord
spake
unto
the
fish
and
it
vomited
out
jonah
upon
the
dry
land
3
1
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jonah
the
second
time
saying
3
2
arise
go
unto
nineveh
that
great
city
and
preach
unto
it
the
preaching
that
i
bid
thee
3
3
so
jonah
arose
and
went
unto
nineveh
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
now
nineveh
was
an
exceeding
great
city
of
three
days’
journey
3
4
and
jonah
began
to
enter
into
the
city
a
day’s
journey
and
he
cried
and
said
yet
forty
days
and
nineveh
shall
be
overthrown
3
5
so
the
people
of
nineveh
believed
god
and
proclaimed
a
fast
and
put
on
sackcloth
from
the
greatest
of
them
even
to
the
least
of
them
3
6
for
word
came
unto
the
king
of
nineveh
and
he
arose
from
his
throne
and
he
laid
his
robe
from
him
and
covered
him
with
sackcloth
and
sat
in
ashes
3
7
and
he
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
and
published
through
nineveh
by
the
decree
of
the
king
and
his
nobles
saying
let
neither
man
nor
beast
herd
nor
flock
taste
any
thing
let
them
not
feed
nor

but
let
man
and
beast
be
covered
with
sackcloth
and
cry
mightily
unto
god
yea
let
them
turn
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
violence
that
is
in
their
hands
3
9
who
can
tell
if
god
will
turn
and
repent
and
turn
away
from
his
fierce
anger
that
we
perish
not
3
10
and
god
saw
their
works
that
they
turned
from
their
evil
way
and
god
repented
of
the
evil
that
he
had
said
that
he
would
do
unto
them
and
he
did
it
not
4
1
but
it
displeased
jonah
exceedingly
and
he
was
very
angry
4
2
and
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
said
i
pray
thee
o
lord
was
not
this
my
saying
when
i
was
yet
in
my
country
therefore
i
fled
before
unto
tarshish
for
i
knew
that
thou
art
a
gracious
god
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
repentest
thee
of
the
evil
4
3
therefore
now
o
lord
take
i
beseech
thee
my
life
from
me
for
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
4
4
then
said
the
lord
doest
thou
well
to
be
angry
4
5
so
jonah
went
out
of
the
city
and
sat
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
and
there
made
him
a
booth
and
sat
under
it
in
the
shadow
till
he
might
see
what
would
become
of
the
city
4
6
and
the
lord
god
prepared
a
gourd
and
made
it
to
come
up
over
jonah
that
it
might
be
a
shadow
over
his
head
to
deliver
him
from
his
grief
so
jonah
was
exceeding
glad
of
the
gourd
4
7
but
god
prepared
a
worm
when
the
morning
rose
the
next
day
and
it
smote
the
gourd
that
it
withered
4
8
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
sun
did
arise
that
god
prepared
a
vehement
east
wind
and
the
sun
beat
upon
the
head
of
jonah
that
he
fainted
and
wished
in
himself
to
die
and
said
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
4
9
and
god
said
to
jonah
doest
thou
well
to
be
angry
for
the
gourd
and
he
said
i
do
well
to
be
angry
even
unto
death
4
10
then
said
the
lord
thou
hast
had
pity
on
the
gourd
for
the
which
thou
hast
not
laboured
neither
madest
it
grow
which
came
up
in
a
night
and
perished
in
a
night
4
11
and
should
not
i
spare
nineveh
that
great
city
wherein
are
more
than
sixscore
thousand
persons
that
cannot
discern
between
their
right
hand
and
their
left
hand
and
also
much
cattle
micah
1

the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
micah
the
morasthite
in
the
days
of
jotham
ahaz
and
hezekiah
kings
of
judah
which
he
saw
concerning
samaria
and
jerusalem
1
2
hear
all
ye
people
hearken
o
earth
and
all
that
therein
is
and
let
the
lord
god
be
witness
against
you
the
lord
from
his
holy
temple
1
3
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
forth
out
of
his
place
and
will
come
down
and
tread
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
1
4
and
the
mountains
shall
be
molten
under
him
and
the
valleys
shall
be
cleft
as
wax
before
the
fire
and
as
the
waters
that
are
poured
down
a
steep
place
1
5
for
the
transgression
of
jacob
is
all
this
and
for
the
sins
of
the
house
of
israel
what
is
the
transgression
of
jacob
is
it
not
samaria
and
what
are
the
high
places
of
judah
are
they
not
jerusalem
1
6
therefore
i
will
make
samaria
as
an
heap
of
the
field
and
as
plantings
of
a
vineyard
and
i
will
pour
down
the
stones
thereof
into
the
valley
and
i
will
discover
the
foundations
thereof
1
7
and
all
the
graven
images
thereof
shall
be
beaten
to
pieces
and
all
the
hires
thereof
shall
be
burned
with
the
fire
and
all
the
idols
thereof
will
i
lay
desolate
for
she
gathered
it
of
the
hire
of
an
harlot
and
they
shall
return
to
the
hire
of
an
harlot
1
8
therefore
i
will
wail
and
howl
i
will
go
stripped
and
naked
i
will
make
a
wailing
like
the
dragons
and
mourning
as
the
owls
1
9
for
her
wound
is
incurable
for
it
is
come
unto
judah
he
is
come
unto
the
gate
of
my
people
even
to
jerusalem
1
10
declare
ye
it
not
at
gath
weep
ye
not
at
all
in
the
house
of
aphrah
roll
thyself
in
the
dust
1
11
pass
ye
away
thou
inhabitant
of
saphir
having
thy
shame
naked
the
inhabitant
of
zaanan
came
not
forth
in
the
mourning
of
bethezel
he
shall
receive
of
you
his
standing
1
12
for
the
inhabitant
of
maroth
waited
carefully
for
good
but
evil
came
down
from
the
lord
unto
the
gate
of
jerusalem
1
13
o
thou
inhabitant
of
lachish
bind
the
chariot
to
the
swift
beast
she
is
the
beginning
of
the
sin
to
the
daughter
of
zion
for
the
transgressions
of
israel
were
found
in
thee
1
14
therefore
shalt
thou
give
presents
to
moreshethgath
the
houses
of
achzib
shall
be
a
lie
to
the
kings
of
israel
1
15
yet
will
i
bring
an
heir
unto
thee
o
inhabitant
of
mareshah
he
shall
come
unto
adullam
the
glory
of
israel
1
16
make
thee
bald
and
poll
thee
for
thy
delicate
children
enlarge
thy
baldness
as
the
eagle
for
they
are
gone
into
captivity
from
thee
2
1
woe
to
them
that
devise
iniquity
and
work
evil
upon
their
beds
when
the
morning
is
light
they
practise
it
because
it
is
in
the
power
of
their
hand
2
2
and
they
covet
fields
and
take
them
by
violence
and
houses
and
take
them
away
so
they
oppress
a
man
and
his
house
even
a
man
and
his
heritage
2
3
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
against
this
family
do
i
devise
an
evil
from
which
ye
shall
not
remove
your
necks
neither
shall
ye
go
haughtily
for
this
time
is
evil
2
4
in
that
day
shall
one
take
up
a
parable
against
you
and
lament
with
a
doleful
lamentation
and
say
we
be
utterly
spoiled
he
hath
changed
the
portion
of
my
people
how
hath
he
removed
it
from
me
turning
away
he
hath
divided
our
fields
2
5
therefore
thou
shalt
have
none
that
shall
cast
a
cord
by
lot
in
the
congregation
of
the
lord
2
6
prophesy
ye
not
say
they
to
them
that
prophesy
they
shall
not
prophesy
to
them
that
they
shall
not
take
shame
2
7
o
thou
that
art
named
the
house
of
jacob
is
the
spirit
of
the
lord
straitened
are
these
his
doings
do
not
my
words
do
good
to
him
that
walketh
uprightly
2
8
even
of
late
my
people
is
risen
up
as
an
enemy
ye
pull
off
the
robe
with
the
garment
from
them
that
pass
by
securely
as
men
averse
from
war
2
9
the
women
of
my
people
have
ye
cast
out
from
their
pleasant
houses
from
their
children
have
ye
taken
away
my
glory
for
ever
2
10
arise
ye
and
depart
for
this
is
not
your
rest
because
it
is
polluted
it
shall
destroy
you
even
with
a
sore
destruction
2
11
if
a
man
walking
in
the
spirit
and
falsehood
do
lie
saying
i
will
prophesy
unto
thee
of
wine
and
of
strong
drink
he
shall
even
be
the
prophet
of
this
people
2
12
i
will
surely
assemble
o
jacob
all
of
thee
i
will
surely
gather
the
remnant
of
israel
i
will
put
them
together
as
the
sheep
of
bozrah
as
the
flock
in
the
midst
of
their
fold
they
shall
make
great
noise
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
men
2
13
the
breaker
is
come
up
before
them
they
have
broken
up
and
have
passed
through
the
gate
and
are
gone
out
by
it
and
their
king
shall
pass
before
them
and
the
lord
on
the
head
of
them
3
1
and
i
said
hear
i
pray
you
o
heads
of
jacob
and
ye
princes
of
the
house
of
israel
is
it
not
for
you
to
know
judgment
3
2
who
hate
the
good
and
love
the
evil
who
pluck
off
their
skin
from
off
them
and
their
flesh
from
off
their
bones
3
3
who
also
eat
the
flesh
of
my
people
and
flay
their
skin
from
off
them
and
they
break
their
bones
and
chop
them
in
pieces
as
for
the
pot
and
as
flesh
within
the
caldron
3
4
then
shall
they
cry
unto
the
lord
but
he
will
not
hear
them
he
will
even
hide
his
face
from
them
at
that
time
as
they
have
behaved
themselves
ill
in
their
doings
3
5
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
prophets
that
make
my
people
err
that
bite
with
their
teeth
and
cry
peace
and
he
that
putteth
not
into
their
mouths
they
even
prepare
war
against
him
3
6
therefore
night
shall
be
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
have
a
vision
and
it
shall
be
dark
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
divine
and
the
sun
shall
go
down
over
the
prophets
and
the
day
shall
be
dark
over
them
3
7
then
shall
the
seers
be
ashamed
and
the
diviners
confounded
yea
they
shall
all
cover
their
lips
for
there
is
no
answer
of
god
3
8
but
truly
i
am
full
of
power
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
of
judgment
and
of
might
to
declare
unto
jacob
his
transgression
and
to
israel
his
sin
3
9
hear
this
i
pray
you
ye
heads
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
princes
of
the
house
of
israel
that
abhor
judgment
and
pervert
all
equity
3
10
they
build
up
zion
with
blood
and
jerusalem
with
iniquity
3
11
the
heads
thereof
judge
for
reward
and
the
priests
thereof
teach
for
hire
and
the
prophets
thereof
divine
for
money
yet
will
they
lean
upon
the
lord
and
say
is
not
the
lord
among
us
none
evil
can
come
upon
us
3
12
therefore
shall
zion
for
your
sake
be
plowed
as
a
field
and
jerusalem
shall
become
heaps
and
the
mountain
of
the
house
as
the
high
places
of
the
forest
4
1
but
in
the
last
days
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
mountain
of
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
it
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills
and
people
shall
flow
unto
it
4
2
and
many
nations
shall
come
and
say
come
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
lord
and
to
the
house
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
for
the
law
shall
go
forth
of
zion
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
4
3
and
he
shall
judge
among
many
people
and
rebuke
strong
nations
afar
off
and
they
shall
beat
their
swords
into
plowshares
and
their
spears
into
pruninghooks
nation
shall
not
lift
up
a
sword
against
nation
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more
4
4
but
they
shall
sit
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
fig
tree
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
spoken
it
4
5
for
all
people
will
walk
every
one
in
the
name
of
his
god
and
we
will
walk
in
the
name
of
the
lord
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
4
6
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
will
i
assemble
her
that
halteth
and
i
will
gather
her
that
is
driven
out
and
her
that
i
have
afflicted
4
7
and
i
will
make
her
that
halted
a
remnant
and
her
that
was
cast
far
off
a
strong
nation
and
the
lord
shall
reign
over
them
in
mount
zion
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
4
8
and
thou
o
tower
of
the
flock
the
strong
hold
of
the
daughter
of
zion
unto
thee
shall
it
come
even
the
first
dominion
the
kingdom
shall
come
to
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
4
9
now
why
dost
thou
cry
out
aloud
is
there
no
king
in
thee
is
thy
counsellor
perished
for
pangs
have
taken
thee
as
a
woman
in
travail
4
10
be
in
pain
and
labour
to
bring
forth
o
daughter
of
zion
like
a
woman
in
travail
for
now
shalt
thou
go
forth
out
of
the
city
and
thou
shalt
dwell
in
the
field
and
thou
shalt
go
even
to
babylon
there
shalt
thou
be
delivered
there
the
lord
shall
redeem
thee
from
the
hand
of
thine
enemies
4
11
now
also
many
nations
are
gathered
against
thee
that
say
let
her
be
defiled
and
let
our
eye
look
upon
zion
4
12
but
they
know
not
the
thoughts
of
the
lord
neither
understand
they
his
counsel
for
he
shall
gather
them
as
the
sheaves
into
the
floor
4
13
arise
and
thresh
o
daughter
of
zion
for
i
will
make
thine
horn
iron
and
i
will
make
thy
hoofs
brass
and
thou
shalt
beat
in
pieces
many
people
and
i
will
consecrate
their
gain
unto
the
lord
and
their
substance
unto
the
lord
of
the
whole
earth
5
1
now
gather
thyself
in
troops
o
daughter
of
troops
he
hath
laid
siege
against
us
they
shall
smite
the
judge
of
israel
with
a
rod
upon
the
cheek
5
2
but
thou
bethlehem
ephratah
though
thou
be
little
among
the
thousands
of
judah
yet
out
of
thee
shall
he
come
forth
unto
me
that
is
to
be
ruler
in
israel
whose
goings
forth
have
been
from
of
old
from
everlasting
5
3
therefore
will
he
give
them
up
until
the
time
that
she
which
travaileth
hath
brought
forth
then
the
remnant
of
his
brethren
shall
return
unto
the
children
of
israel
5
4
and
he
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
and
they
shall
abide
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
5
5
and
this
man
shall
be
the
peace
when
the
assyrian
shall
come
into
our
land
and
when
he
shall
tread
in
our
palaces
then
shall
we
raise
against
him
seven
shepherds
and
eight
principal
men
5
6
and
they
shall
waste
the
land
of
assyria
with
the
sword
and
the
land
of
nimrod
in
the
entrances
thereof
thus
shall
he
deliver
us
from
the
assyrian
when
he
cometh
into
our
land
and
when
he
treadeth
within
our
borders
5
7
and
the
remnant
of
jacob
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
many
people
as
a
dew
from
the
lord
as
the
showers
upon
the
grass
that
tarrieth
not
for
man
nor
waiteth
for
the
sons
of
men
5
8
and
the
remnant
of
jacob
shall
be
among
the
gentiles
in
the
midst
of
many
people
as
a
lion
among
the
beasts
of
the
forest
as
a
young
lion
among
the
flocks
of
sheep
who
if
he
go
through
both
treadeth
down
and
teareth
in
pieces
and
none
can
deliver
5
9
thine
hand
shall
be
lifted
up
upon
thine
adversaries
and
all
thine
enemies
shall
be
cut
off
5
10
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
cut
off
thy
horses
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
and
i
will
destroy
thy
chariots
5
11
and
i
will
cut
off
the
cities
of
thy
land
and
throw
down
all
thy
strong
holds

and
i
will
cut
off
witchcrafts
out

thine

and
thou
shalt
have
no

soothsayers
5
13
thy
graven
images
also
will
i
cut
off
and
thy
standing
images
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
and
thou
shalt
no

worship
the
work

5

and
i
will
pluck
up
thy
groves
out

of
thee
so
will
i
destroy
thy
cities
5
15
and
i
will
execute
vengeance
in
anger
and
fury
upon
the
heathen
such
as
they
have
not
heard
6
1
hear
ye
now
what
the
lord
saith
arise
contend
thou
before
the
mountains
and
let
the
hills
hear
thy
voice
6
2
hear
ye
o
mountains
the
lord’s
controversy
and
ye
strong
foundations
of
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
his
people
and
he
will
plead
with
israel
6
3
o
my
people
what
have
i
done
unto
thee
and
wherein
have
i
wearied
thee
testify
against
me
6
4
for
i
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
redeemed
thee
out
of
the
house
of
servants
and
i
sent
before
thee
moses
aaron
and
miriam
6
5
o
my
people
remember
now
what
balak
king
of
moab
consulted
and
what
balaam
the
son
of
beor
answered
him
from
shittim
unto
gilgal
that
ye
may
know
the
righteousness
of
the
lord
6
6
wherewith
shall
i
come
before
the
lord
and
bow
myself
before
the
high
god
shall
i
come
before
him
with
burnt
offerings
with
calves
of
a
year
old
6
7
will
the
lord
be
pleased
with
thousands
of
rams
or
with
ten
thousands
of
rivers
of
oil
shall
i
give
my
firstborn
for
my
transgression
the
fruit
of
my
body
for
the
sin
of
my
soul
6
8
he
hath
shewed
thee
o
man
what
is
good
and
what
doth
the
lord
require
of
thee
but
to
do
justly
and
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
with
thy
god
6
9
the
lord’s
voice
crieth
unto
the
city
and
the
man
of
wisdom
shall
see
thy
name
hear
ye
the
rod
and
who
hath
appointed
it
6
10
are
there
yet
the
treasures
of
wickedness
in
the
house
of
the
wicked
and
the
scant
measure
that
is
abominable
6
11
shall
i
count
them
pure
with
the
wicked
balances
and
with
the
bag
of
deceitful
weights
6
12
for
the
rich
men
thereof
are
full
of
violence
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
have
spoken
lies
and
their
tongue
is
deceitful
in
their
mouth
6
13
therefore
also
will
i
make
thee
sick
in
smiting
thee
in
making
thee
desolate
because
of
thy
sins
6
14
thou
shalt
eat
but
not
be
satisfied
and
thy
casting
down
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
thou
shalt
take
hold
but
shalt
not
deliver
and
that
which
thou
deliverest
will
i
give
up
to
the
sword
6
15
thou
shalt
sow
but
thou
shalt
not
reap
thou
shalt
tread
the
olives
but
thou
shalt
not
anoint
thee
with
oil
and
sweet
wine
but
shalt
not
drink
wine
6
16
for
the
statutes
of
omri
are
kept
and
all
the
works
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
ye
walk
in
their
counsels
that
i
should
make
thee
a
desolation
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
an
hissing
therefore
ye
shall
bear
the
reproach
of
my
people
7
1
woe
is
me
for
i
am
as
when
they
have
gathered
the
summer
fruits
as
the
grapegleanings
of
the
vintage
there
is
no
cluster
to
eat
my
soul
desired
the
firstripe
fruit
7
2
the
good
man
is
perished
out
of
the
earth
and
there
is
none
upright
among
men
they
all
lie
in
wait
for
blood
they
hunt
every
man
his
brother
with
a
net
7
3
that
they
may
do
evil
with
both
hands
earnestly
the
prince
asketh
and
the
judge
asketh
for
a
reward
and
the
great
man
he
uttereth
his
mischievous
desire
so
they
wrap
it
up
7
4
the
best
of
them
is
as
a
brier
the
most
upright
is
sharper
than
a
thorn
hedge
the
day
of
thy
watchmen
and
thy
visitation
cometh
now
shall
be
their
perplexity
7
5
trust
ye
not
in
a
friend
put
ye
not
confidence
in
a
guide
keep
the
doors
of
thy
mouth
from
her
that
lieth
in
thy
bosom
7
6
for
the
son
dishonoureth
the
father
the
daughter
riseth
up
against
her
mother
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law
a
man’s
enemies
are
the
men
of
his
own
house
7
7
therefore
i
will
look
unto
the
lord
i
will
wait
for
the
god
of
my
salvation
my
god
will
hear
me
7
8
rejoice
not
against
me
o
mine
enemy
when
i
fall
i
shall
arise
when
i
sit
in
darkness
the
lord
shall
be
a
light
unto
me
7
9
i
will
bear
the
indignation
of
the
lord
because
i
have
sinned
against
him
until
he
plead
my
cause
and
execute
judgment
for
me
he
will
bring
me
forth
to
the
light
and
i
shall
behold
his
righteousness
7
10
then
she
that
is
mine
enemy
shall
see
it
and
shame
shall
cover
her
which
said
unto
me
where
is
the
lord
thy
god
mine
eyes
shall
behold
her
now
shall
she
be
trodden
down
as
the
mire
of
the
streets
7
11
in
the
day
that
thy
walls
are
to
be
built
in
that
day
shall
the
decree
be
far
removed
7
12
in
that
day
also
he
shall
come
even
to
thee
from
assyria
and
from
the
fortified
cities
and
from
the
fortress
even
to
the
river
and
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
mountain
to
mountain
7
13
notwithstanding
the
land
shall
be
desolate
because
of
them
that
dwell
therein
for
the
fruit
of
their
doings
7
14
feed
thy
people
with
thy
rod
the
flock
of
thine
heritage
which
dwell
solitarily
in
the
wood
in
the
midst
of
carmel
let
them
feed
in
bashan
and
gilead
as
in
the
days
of
old
7
15
according
to
the
days
of
thy
coming
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
will
i
shew
unto
him
marvellous
things
7
16
the
nations
shall
see
and
be
confounded
at
all
their
might
they
shall
lay
their
hand
upon
their
mouth
their
ears
shall
be
deaf
7
17
they
shall
lick
the
dust
like
a
serpent
they
shall
move
out
of
their
holes
like
worms
of
the
earth
they
shall
be
afraid
of
the
lord
our
god
and
shall
fear
because
of
thee
7
18
who
is
a
god
like
unto
thee
that
pardoneth
iniquity
and
passeth
by
the
transgression
of
the
remnant
of
his
heritage
he
retaineth
not
his
anger
for
ever
because
he
delighteth
in
mercy
7
19
he
will
turn
again
he
will
have
compassion
upon
us
he
will
subdue
our
iniquities
and
thou
wilt
cast
all
their
sins
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
7
20
thou
wilt
perform
the
truth
to
jacob

the
mercy
to
abraham
which
thou
hast
sworn
unto
our

save
1
3
why
dost
thou
shew
me
iniquity
and
cause
me
to
behold
grievance
for
spoiling
and
violence
are
before
me
and
there
are
that
raise
up
strife
and
contention
1
4
therefore
the
law
is
slacked
and
judgment
doth
never
go
forth
for
the
wicked
doth
compass
about
the
righteous
therefore
wrong
judgment
proceedeth
1
5
behold
ye
among
the
heathen
and
regard
and
wonder
marvelously
for
i
will
work
a
work
in
your
days
which
ye
will
not
believe
though
it
be
told
you
1
6
for
lo
i
raise
up
the
chaldeans
that
bitter
and
hasty
nation
which
shall
march
through
the
breadth
of
the
land
to
possess
the
dwellingplaces
that
are
not
theirs
1
7
they
are
terrible
and
dreadful
their
judgment
and
their
dignity
shall
proceed
of
themselves
1
8
their
horses
also
are
swifter
than
the
leopards
and
are
more
fierce
than
the
evening
wolves
and
their
horsemen
shall
spread
themselves
and
their
horsemen
shall
come
from
far
they
shall
fly
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
eat
1
9
they
shall
come
all
for
violence
their
faces
shall
sup
up
as
the
east
wind
and
they
shall
gather
the
captivity
as
the
sand
1
10
and
they
shall
scoff
at
the
kings
and
the
princes
shall
be
a
scorn
unto
them
they
shall
deride
every
strong
hold
for
they
shall
heap
dust
and
take
it
1
11
then
shall
his
mind
change
and
he
shall
pass
over
and
offend
imputing
this
his
power
unto
his
god
1
12
art
thou
not
from
everlasting
o
lord
my
god
mine
holy
one
we
shall
not
die
o
lord
thou
hast
ordained
them
for
judgment
and
o
mighty
god
thou
hast
established
them
for
correction
1
13
thou
art
of
purer
eyes
than
to
behold
evil
and
canst
not
look
on
iniquity
wherefore
lookest
thou
upon
them
that
deal
treacherously
and
holdest
thy
tongue
when
the
wicked
devoureth
the
man
that
is
more
righteous
than
he
1
14
and
makest
men
as
the
fishes
of
the
sea
as
the
creeping
things
that
have
no
ruler
over
them
1
15
they
take
up
all
of
them
with
the
angle
they
catch
them
in
their
net
and
gather
them
in
their
drag
therefore
they
rejoice
and
are
glad
1
16
therefore
they
sacrifice
unto
their
net
and
burn
incense
unto
their
drag
because
by
them
their
portion
is
fat
and
their
meat
plenteous
1
17
shall
they
therefore
empty
their
net
and
not
spare
continually
to
slay
the
nations
2
1
i
will
stand
upon
my
watch
and
set
me
upon
the
tower
and
will
watch
to
see
what
he
will
say
unto
me
and
what
i
shall
answer
when
i
am
reproved
2
2
and
the
lord
answered
me
and
said
write
the
vision
and
make
it
plain
upon
tables
that
he
may
run
that
readeth
it
2
3
for
the
vision
is
yet
for
an
appointed
time
but
at
the
end
it
shall
speak
and
not
lie
though
it
tarry
wait
for
it
because
it
will
surely
come
it
will
not
tarry
2
4
behold
his
soul
which
is
lifted
up
is
not
upright
in
him
but
the
just
shall
live
by
his
faith
2
5
yea
also
because
he
transgresseth
by
wine
he
is
a
proud
man
neither
keepeth
at
home
who
enlargeth
his
desire
as
hell
and
is
as
death
and
cannot
be
satisfied
but
gathereth
unto
him
all
nations
and
heapeth
unto
him
all
people
2
6
shall
not
all
these
take
up
a
parable
against
him
and
a
taunting
proverb
against
him
and
say
woe
to
him
that
increaseth
that
which
is
not
his
how
long
and
to
him
that
ladeth
himself
with
thick
clay
2
7
shall
they
not
rise
up
suddenly
that
shall
bite
thee
and
awake
that
shall
vex
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
for
booties
unto
them
2
8
because
thou
hast
spoiled
many
nations
all
the
remnant
of
the
people
shall
spoil
thee
because
of
men’s
blood
and
for
the
violence
of
the
land
of
the
city
and
of
all
that
dwell
therein
2
9
woe
to
him
that
coveteth
an
evil
covetousness
to
his
house
that
he
may
set
his
nest
on
high
that
he
may
be
delivered
from
the
power
of
evil
2
10
thou
hast
consulted
shame
to
thy
house
by
cutting
off
many
people
and
hast
sinned
against
thy
soul
2
11
for
the
stone
shall
cry
out
of
the
wall
and
the
beam
out
of
the
timber
shall
answer
it
2
12
woe
to
him
that
buildeth
a
town
with
blood
and
stablisheth
a
city
by
iniquity
2
13
behold
is
it
not
of
the
lord
of
hosts
that
the
people
shall
labour
in
the
very
fire
and
the
people
shall
weary
themselves
for
very
vanity
2
14
for
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
2
15
woe
unto
him
that
giveth
his
neighbour
drink
that
puttest
thy
bottle
to
him
and
makest
him
drunken
also
that
thou
mayest
look
on
their
nakedness
2
16
thou
art
filled
with
shame
for
glory
drink
thou
also
and
let
thy
foreskin
be
uncovered
the
cup
of
the
lord’s
right
hand
shall
be
turned
unto
thee
and
shameful
spewing
shall
be
on
thy
glory
2
17
for
the
violence
of
lebanon
shall
cover
thee
and
the
spoil
of
beasts
which
made
them
afraid
because
of
men’s
blood
and
for
the
violence
of
the
land
of
the
city
and
of
all
that
dwell
therein
2
18
what
profiteth
the
graven
image
that
the
maker
thereof
hath
graven
it
the
molten
image
and
a
teacher
of
lies
that
the
maker
of
his
work
trusteth
therein
to
make
dumb
idols
2
19
woe
unto
him
that
saith
to
the
wood
awake
to
the
dumb
stone
arise
it
shall
teach
behold
it
is
laid
over
with
gold
and
silver
and
there
is
no
breath
at
all
in
the
midst
of
it

the

in

keep
silence

him

was
the

was
thine
anger
against

thy
wrath
against
the

thou
didst
ride
upon

thy

still
in
their
habitation
at
the
light
of
thine
arrows
they
went
and
at
the
shining
of
thy
glittering
spear
3
12
thou
didst
march
through
the
land
in
indignation
thou
didst
thresh
the
heathen
in
anger
3
13
thou
wentest
forth
for
the
salvation
of
thy
people
even
for
salvation
with
thine
anointed
thou
woundedst
the
head
out
of
the
house
of
the
wicked
by
discovering
the
foundation
unto
the
neck
selah
3
14
thou
didst
strike
through
with
his
staves
the
head
of
his

came
out
as
a
whirlwind
to
scatter
me
their
rejoicing
was
as
to
devour
the

thou
didst
walk
through

sea
with
thine
horses
through
the
heap
of
great
waters
3
16
when
i
heard
my
belly

my
lips
quivered
at
the

rottenness
entered
into

i
trembled
in
myself
that
i
might
rest
in
the
day
of
trouble
when
he
cometh
up
unto
the

he
will
invade

i
will
punish

punish

1
10
and
it

day
saith
the
lord
that
there
shall
be
the
noise
of
a
cry
from

fish
gate

an
howling
from

woe
unto

against
you
o
canaan
the

i
will
even
destroy
thee
that

and
the
sea
coast
shall
be
dwellings

for

and
the
coast
shall
be
for
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
judah
they
shall
feed
thereupon
in
the
houses
of
ashkelon
shall
they
lie
down
in
the
evening
for
the
lord
their
god
shall
visit
them
and
turn
away
their
captivity
2
8
i
have
heard
the
reproach
of
moab
and
the
revilings
of
the
children
of
ammon
whereby
they
have
reproached
my
people
and
magnified
themselves
against
their
border
2
9
therefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
surely
moab
shall
be
as
sodom
and
the
children
of
ammon
as
gomorrah
even
the
breeding
of
nettles
and
saltpits
and
a
perpetual
desolation
the
residue
of
my
people
shall
spoil
them
and
the
remnant
of
my
people
shall
possess
them
2
10
this
shall
they
have
for
their
pride
because
they
have
reproached
and
magnified
themselves
against
the
people
of
the
lord
of
hosts
2
11
the
lord
will
be
terrible
unto
them
for
he
will
famish
all
the
gods
of
the
earth
and
men
shall
worship
him
every
one
from
his
place
even
all
the
isles
of
the
heathen
2
12
ye
ethiopians
also
ye
shall
be
slain
by
my
sword
2
13
and
he
will
stretch
out
his
hand
against
the
north
and
destroy
assyria
and
will
make
nineveh
a
desolation
and
dry
like
a
wilderness
2
14
and
flocks
shall
lie
down
in
the
midst
of
her
all
the
beasts
of
the
nations
both
the
cormorant
and
the
bittern
shall
lodge
in
the
upper
lintels
of

their
voice
shall
sing
in
the
windows
desolation
shall
be
in
the
thresholds
for

shall
uncover
the
cedar
work

this
is
the
rejoicing
city
that

her
heart
i
am
and
there
is
none
beside
me
how
is
she
become
a
desolation
a
place
for
beasts
to
lie
down
in
every
one
that
passeth
by
her
shall
hiss
and
wag
his
hand
3
1
woe
to
her
that
is
filthy
and
polluted
to
the
oppressing
city
3
2
she
obeyed
not
the
voice
she
received
not
correction
she
trusted
not
in
the
lord
she
drew
not
near
to
her
god
3
3
her
princes
within
her
are
roaring
lions
her
judges
are
evening
wolves
they
gnaw
not
the
bones
till
the
morrow
3
4
her
prophets
are
light
and
treacherous
persons
her
priests
have
polluted
the
sanctuary
they
have
done
violence
to
the
law
3
5
the
just
lord
is
in
the
midst
thereof
he
will
not
do
iniquity
every
morning
doth
he
bring
his
judgment
to
light
he
faileth
not
but
the
unjust
knoweth
no
shame
3
6
i
have
cut
off
the
nations
their
towers
are
desolate
i
made
their
streets
waste
that
none
passeth
by
their
cities
are
destroyed
so
that
there
is
no
man
that
there
is
none
inhabitant
3
7
i
said
surely
thou
wilt
fear
me
thou
wilt
receive
instruction
so
their
dwelling
should
not
be
cut
off
howsoever
i
punished
them
but
they
rose
early
and
corrupted
all
their
doings
3
8
therefore
wait
ye
upon
me
saith
the
lord
until
the
day
that
i
rise
up
to
the
prey
for
my
determination
is
to
gather
the
nations
that
i
may
assemble
the
kingdoms
to
pour
upon
them
mine
indignation
even
all
my
fierce
anger
for
all
the
earth
shall
be
devoured
with
the
fire
of
my
jealousy
3
9
for
then
will
i
turn
to
the
people
a
pure
language
that
they
may
all
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
to
serve
him
with
one
consent
3
10
from
beyond
the
rivers
of
ethiopia
my
suppliants
even
the
daughter
of
my
dispersed
shall
bring
mine
offering
3
11
in
that
day
shalt
thou
not
be
ashamed
for
all
thy
doings
wherein
thou
hast
transgressed
against
me
for
then
i
will
take
away
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
them
that
rejoice
in
thy
pride
and
thou
shalt
no
more
be
haughty
because
of
my
holy
mountain
3
12
i
will
also
leave
in
the
midst
of
thee
an
afflicted
and
poor
people
and
they
shall
trust
in
the
name
of
the
lord
3
13
the
remnant
of
israel
shall
not
do
iniquity
nor
speak
lies
neither
shall
a
deceitful
tongue
be
found
in
their
mouth
for
they
shall
feed
and
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid

sing
o

of
zion

o
israel
be
glad
and
rejoice
with
all
the
heart
o
daughter
of
jerusalem
3
15
the
lord
hath
taken
away
thy
judgments
he
hath
cast
out
thine
enemy
the
king
of
israel
even
the
lord
is
in
the
midst
of
thee
thou
shalt
not
see
evil
any
more
3
16
in
that
day
it
shall
be
said
to
jerusalem
fear
thou
not

to

let
not
thine
hands
be
slack
3
17
the
lord
thy
god
in
the
midst
of
thee
is
mighty
he
will
save
he
will
rejoice
over
thee
with
joy
he
will
rest
in
his
love
he
will
joy
over
thee
with
singing
3
18
i
will
gather
them
that
are
sorrowful
for
the
solemn
assembly
who
are
of
thee
to
whom
the
reproach
of
it
was
a
burden
3
19
behold
at
that
time
i
will
undo
all
that
afflict
thee
and
i
will
save
her
that
halteth
and
gather
her
that
was
driven
out
and
i
will
get
them
praise
and
fame
in
every
land
where
they
have
been
put
to
shame
3
20
at
that
time
will
i
bring
you
again
even
in
the
time
that
i
gather
you
for
i
will
make
you
a
name
and
a
praise
among
all
people
of
the
earth
when
i
turn
back
your
captivity
before
your
eyes
saith
the
lord
haggai
1
1
in
the
second
year
of
darius
the
king
in
the
sixth
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
came
the
word
of
the
lord
by
haggai
the
prophet
unto
zerubbabel
the
son
of
shealtiel
governor
of

and
to

saying
1
2
thus
speaketh
the

saying
this
people
say
the
time
is
not
come
the
time
that
the
lord’s
house
should
be
built
1
3
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
by
haggai
the
prophet
saying
1
4
is
it
time
for
you
o
ye

waste
1
5
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of

ways
1
6
ye
have
sown
much
and
bring
in
little

eat
but
ye
have
not
enough
ye
drink
but
ye
are
not

you
but
there
is
none
warm
and
he
that

to
put
it
into
a
bag
with
holes
1
7
thus
saith
the
lord
of

consider
your
ways
1
8
go
up
to
the
mountain
and
bring
wood
and
build
the
house
and
i
will
take
pleasure
in
it
and
i
will
be
glorified
saith
the
lord
1
9
ye
looked
for
much
and
lo
it
came
to
little
and
when
ye
brought
it
home
i
did
blow
upon
it
why
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
because
of
mine
house
that
is
waste
and
ye
run
every
man
unto
his
own
house
1
10
therefore
the
heaven
over
you
is
stayed
from
dew
and
the
earth
is
stayed
from
her
fruit
1
11
and
i
called
for
a
drought
upon
the
land
and
upon
the
mountains
and
upon
the
corn
and
upon
the
new
wine
and
upon
the
oil
and
upon
that
which
the
ground
bringeth
forth
and
upon
men
and
upon
cattle
and
upon
all
the
labour
of
the
hands
1
12
then
zerubbabel
the
son
of
shealtiel
and
joshua
the
son
of
josedech
the
high

with
all
the

their
god
and
the
words
of
haggai
the
prophet
as
the
lord
their
god
had
sent
him
and
the
people
did
fear
before
the

13
then
spake
haggai
the
lord’s
messenger
in
the
lord’s
message
unto
the
people
saying
i
am
with
you
saith
the
lord
1
14

and
the
spirit
of
joshua
the

and
they
came
and
did
work
in
the
house
of
the
lord
of

5
according

2
6
for

saith
the
lord
of

yet
once
it

a
little
while
and
i
will
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
the

and
the
dry
land
2
7
and
i
will
shake
all
nations
and
the
desire
of
all
nations
shall
come
and
i
will
fill
this
house
with
glory
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
2
8
the
silver
is
mine
and
the
gold
is
mine
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
2
9
the
glory
of
this
latter
house
shall
be
greater
than
of
the
former
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
in
this
place
will
i
give
peace
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
2
10
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
ninth
month
in
the
second
year
of
darius
came
the
word
of
the
lord
by
haggai
the
prophet
saying
2
11
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
ask
now
the
priests
concerning
the
law
saying
2
12
if
one
bear
holy
flesh
in
the
skirt
of
his
garment
and
with
his
skirt
do
touch
bread
or
pottage
or
wine
or
oil
or
any
meat
shall
it
be
holy
and
the
priests
answered
and
said
no
2
13
then
said
haggai
if
one
that
is
unclean
by
a
dead
body
touch
any
of
these
shall
it
be
unclean
and
the
priests
answered
and
said
it
shall
be
unclean
2
14
then
answered
haggai
and
said
so
is
this
people
and
so
is
this
nation
before
me
saith
the
lord
and
so
is
every
work
of
their
hands
and
that
which
they
offer
there
is
unclean
2
15
and
now
i
pray
you
consider
from
this
day
and
upward
from
before
a
stone
was
laid
upon
a
stone
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
2
16
since
those
days
were
when
one
came
to
an
heap
of
twenty
measures
there
were
but
ten
when
one
came
to
the
pressfat
for
to
draw
out
fifty
vessels
out
of
the
press
there
were
but
twenty
2
17
i
smote
you
with
blasting
and
with
mildew
and
with
hail
in
all
the
labours
of
your
hands
yet
ye
turned
not
to
me
saith
the
lord
2
18
consider
now
from
this
day
and
upward
from
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
ninth
month
even
from
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
lord’s
temple
was
laid
consider
it
2
19
is
the
seed
yet
in
the
barn
yea
as
yet
the
vine
and
the
fig
tree
and
the
pomegranate
and
the
olive
tree
hath
not
brought
forth
from
this
day
will
i
bless
you
2
20
and
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
haggai
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
month
saying
2
21
speak
to
zerubbabel
governor
of
judah
saying
i
will
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
2
22
and
i
will
overthrow
the
throne
of
kingdoms
and
i
will
destroy
the
strength
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
heathen
and
i
will
overthrow
the
chariots
and
those
that
ride
in
them
and
the
horses
and
their
riders
shall
come
down
every
one
by
the
sword
of
his
brother
2
23
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
will
i
take
thee
o
zerubbabel
my
servant
the
son
of
shealtiel
saith
the
lord
and
will
make
thee
as
a
signet
for
i
have
chosen
thee
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
zechariah
1
1
in
the
eighth
month
in
the
second
year
of
darius
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
zechariah
the
son
of
berechiah
the
son
of
iddo
the
prophet
saying
1
2
the
lord
hath
been
sore
displeased
with
your
fathers
1
3
therefore
say
thou
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
turn
ye
unto
me
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
i
will
turn
unto
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
1
4
be
ye
not
as
your
fathers
unto
whom
the
former
prophets
have
cried
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
turn
ye
now
from
your
evil
ways
and
from
your
evil
doings
but
they
did
not
hear
nor
hearken
unto
me
saith
the
lord
1
5
your
fathers
where
are
they
and
the
prophets
do
they
live
for
ever
1
6
but
my
words
and
my
statutes
which
i
commanded
my
servants
the
prophets
did
they
not
take
hold
of
your
fathers
and
they
returned
and
said
like
as
the
lord
of
hosts
thought
to
do
unto
us
according
to
our
ways
and
according
to
our
doings
so
hath
he
dealt
with
us
1
7
upon
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
eleventh
month
which
is
the
month
sebat
in
the
second
year
of
darius
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
zechariah
the
son
of
berechiah
the
son
of
iddo
the
prophet
saying
1
8
i
saw
by
night
and
behold
a
man
riding
upon
a
red
horse
and
he
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees
that
were
in
the
bottom
and
behind
him
were
there
red
horses
speckled
and
white
1
9
then
said
i
o
my
lord
what
are
these
and
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
said
unto
me
i
will
shew
thee
what
these
be
1
10
and
the
man
that
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees
answered
and
said
these
are
they
whom
the
lord
hath
sent
to
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth
1
11
and
they
answered
the
angel
of
the
lord
that
stood
among
the
myrtle
trees
and
said
we
have
walked
to
and
fro
through
the
earth
and
behold
all
the
earth
sitteth
still
and
is
at
rest
1
12
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
answered
and
said
o
lord
of
hosts
how
long
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
on
jerusalem
and
on
the
cities
of
judah
against
which
thou
hast
had
indignation
these
threescore
and
ten
years
1
13
and
the
lord
answered
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
with
good
words
and
comfortable
words
1
14
so
the
angel
that
communed
with
me
said
unto
me
cry
thou
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
am
jealous
for
jerusalem
and
for
zion
with
a
great
jealousy
1
15
and
i
am
very
sore
displeased
with
the
heathen
that
are
at
ease
for
i
was
but
a
little
displeased
and
they
helped
forward
the
affliction
1
16
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
i
am
returned
to
jerusalem
with
mercies
my
house
shall
be
built
in
it
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
a
line
shall
be
stretched
forth
upon
jerusalem
1
17
cry
yet
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
my
cities
through
prosperity
shall
yet
be
spread
abroad
and
the
lord
shall
yet
comfort
zion
and
shall
yet
choose
jerusalem
1
18
then
lifted
i
up
mine
eyes
and
saw
and
behold
four
horns
1
19
and
i
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
what
be
these
and
he
answered
me
these
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
judah
israel
and
jerusalem
1
20
and
the
lord
shewed
me
four
carpenters
1
21
then
said
i
what
come
these
to
do
and
he
spake
saying
these
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
judah
so
that
no
man
did
lift
up
his
head
but
these
are
come
to
fray
them
to
cast
out
the
horns
of
the
gentiles
which
lifted
up
their
horn
over
the
land
of
judah
to
scatter
it
2
1
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
again
and
looked
and
behold
a
man
with
a
measuring
line
in
his
hand
2
2
then
said
i
whither
goest
thou
and
he
said
unto
me
to
measure
jerusalem
to
see
what
is
the
breadth
thereof
and
what
is
the
length
thereof
2
3
and
behold
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
forth
and
another
angel
went
out
to
meet
him
2

and
said
unto
him
run
speak
to
this
young
man
saying
jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
as
towns
without
walls
for
the
multitude
of
men
and
cattle
therein
2
5
for
i
saith
the
lord
will
be
unto
her
a
wall
of
fire
round
about
and
will
be
the
glory
in
the
midst
of
her
2
6
ho
ho
come
forth
and
flee
from
the
land
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
for
i
have
spread
you
abroad
as
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
saith
the
lord
2
7
deliver
thyself
o
zion
that
dwellest
with
the
daughter
of
babylon
2
8
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
after
the
glory
hath
he
sent
me
unto
the
nations
which
spoiled
you
for
he
that
toucheth
you
toucheth
the
apple
of
his
eye
2
9
for
behold
i
will
shake
mine
hand
upon
them
and
they
shall
be
a
spoil
to
their
servants
and
ye
shall
know
that
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
2
10
sing
and
rejoice
o
daughter
of
zion
for
lo
i
come
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
thee
saith
the
lord
2
11
and
many
nations
shall
be
joined
to
the
lord
in
that
day
and
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
thee
2
12
and
the
lord
shall
inherit
judah
his
portion
in
the
holy
land
and
shall
choose
jerusalem
again
2
13
be
silent
o
all
flesh
before
the
lord
for
he
is
raised
up
out
of
his
holy
habitation
3
1
and
he
shewed
me
joshua
the
high
priest
standing
before
the
angel
of
the
lord
and
satan
standing
at
his
right
hand
to
resist
him
3
2
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
the
lord
rebuke
thee
o
satan
even
the
lord
that
hath
chosen
jerusalem
rebuke
thee
is
not
this
a
brand
plucked
out
of
the
fire
3
3
now
joshua
was
clothed
with
filthy
garments
and
stood
before
the
angel
3
4
and
he
answered
and
spake
unto
those
that
stood
before
him
saying
take
away
the
filthy
garments
from
him
and
unto
him
he
said
behold
i
have
caused
thine
iniquity
to
pass
from
thee
and
i
will
clothe
thee
with
change
of
raiment
3
5
and
i
said
let
them
set
a
fair
mitre
upon
his
head
so
they
set
a
fair
mitre
upon
his
head
and
clothed
him
with
garments
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
by
3
6
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
protested
unto
joshua
saying
3
7
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
and
if
thou
wilt
keep
my
charge
then
thou
shalt
also
judge
my
house
and
shalt
also
keep
my
courts
and
i
will
give
thee
places
to
walk
among
these
that
stand
by
3
8
hear
now
o
joshua
the
high
priest
thou
and
thy
fellows
that
sit
before
thee
for
they
are
men
wondered
at
for
behold
i
will
bring
forth
my
servant
the
branch
3
9
for
behold
the
stone
that
i
have
laid
before
joshua
upon
one
stone
shall
be
seven
eyes
behold
i
will
engrave
the
graving
thereof
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
i
will
remove
the
iniquity
of
that
land
in
one
day
3
10
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
ye
call
every
man
his
neighbour
under
the
vine
and
under
the
fig
tree
4
1
and
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
came
again
and
waked
me
as
a
man
that
is
wakened
out
of
his
sleep
4
2
and
said
unto
me
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
i
have
looked
and
behold
a
candlestick
all
of
gold
with
a
bowl
upon
the
top
of
it
and
his
seven
lamps
thereon
and
seven
pipes
to
the
seven
lamps
which
are
upon
the
top
thereof
4
3
and
two
olive
trees
by
it
one
upon
the
right
side
of
the
bowl
and
the
other
upon
the
left
side
thereof
4
4
so
i
answered
and
spake
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
saying
what
are
these
my
lord
4
5
then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
answered
and
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
not
what
these
be
and
i
said
no
my
lord
4
6
then
he
answered
and
spake
unto
me
saying
this
is
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
zerubbabel
saying
not
by
might
nor
by
power
but
by
my
spirit
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
4
7
who
art
thou
o
great
mountain
before
zerubbabel
thou
shalt
become
a
plain
and
he
shall
bring
forth
the
headstone
thereof
with
shoutings
crying
grace
grace
unto
it
4
8
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
4
9
the
hands
of
zerubbabel
have
laid
the
foundation
of
this
house
his
hands
shall
also
finish
it
and
thou
shalt
know
that
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
you
4
10
for
who
hath
despised
the
day
of
small
things
for
they
shall
rejoice
and
shall
see
the
plummet
in
the
hand
of
zerubbabel
with
those
seven
they
are
the
eyes
of
the
lord
which
run
to
and
fro
through
the
whole
earth
4
11
then
answered
i
and
said
unto
him
what
are
these
two
olive
trees
upon
the
right
side
of
the
candlestick
and
upon
the
left
side
thereof
4
12
and
i
answered
again
and
said
unto
him
what
be
these
two
olive
branches
which
through
the
two
golden
pipes
empty
the
golden
oil
out
of
themselves
4
13
and
he
answered
me
and
said
knowest
thou
not
what
these
be
and
i
said
no
my
lord
4
14
then
said
he
these
are
the
two
anointed
ones
that
stand
by
the
lord
of
the
whole
earth
5
1
then
i
turned
and
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
flying
roll
5
2
and
he
said
unto
me
what
seest
thou
and
i
answered
i
see
a
flying
roll
the
length
thereof
is
twenty
cubits
and
the
breadth
thereof
ten
cubits
5
3
then
said
he
unto
me
this
is
the
curse
that
goeth
forth
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
for
every
one
that
stealeth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
this
side
according
to
it
and
every
one
that
sweareth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
that
side
according
to
it
5
4
i
will
bring
it
forth
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
it
shall
enter
into
the
house
of
the
thief
and
into
the
house
of
him
that
sweareth
falsely
by
my
name
and
it
shall
remain
in
the
midst
of
his
house
and
shall
consume
it
with
the
timber
thereof
and
the
stones
thereof
5
5
then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
forth
and
said
unto
me
lift
up
now
thine
eyes
and
see
what
is
this
that
goeth
forth
5
6
and
i
said
what
is
it
and
he
said
this
is
an
ephah
that
goeth
forth
he
said
moreover
this
is
their
resemblance
through
all
the
earth
5
7
and
behold
there
was
lifted
up
a
talent
of
lead
and
this
is
a
woman
that
sitteth
in
the
midst
of
the
ephah
5
8
and
he
said
this
is
wickedness
and
he
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
the
ephah
and
he
cast
the
weight
of
lead
upon
the
mouth
thereof
5
9
then
lifted
i
up
mine
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
came
out
two
women
and
the
wind
was
in
their
wings
for
they
had
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
stork
and
they
lifted
up
the
ephah
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven
5
10
then
said
i
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
whither
do
these
bear
the
ephah
5
11
and
he
said
unto
me
to
build
it
an
house
in
the
land
of
shinar
and
it
shall
be
established
and
set
there
upon
her
own
base
6
1
and
i
turned
and
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
came
four
chariots
out
from
between
two
mountains
and
the
mountains
were
mountains
of
brass
6
2
in
the
first
chariot
were
red
horses
and
in
the
second
chariot
black
horses
6
3
and
in
the
third
chariot
white
horses
and
in
the
fourth
chariot
grisled
and
bay
horses
6
4
then
i
answered
and
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
what
are
these
my
lord
6
5
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
me
these
are
the
four
spirits
of
the
heavens
which
go
forth
from
standing
before
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
6
6
the
black
horses
which
are
therein
go
forth
into
the
north
country
and
the
white
go
forth
after
them
and
the
grisled
go
forth
toward
the
south
country
6
7
and
the
bay
went
forth
and
sought
to
go
that
they
might
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth
and
he
said
get
you
hence
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
earth
so
they
walked
to
and
fro
through
the
earth
6
8
then
cried
he
upon
me
and
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
these
that
go
toward
the
north
country
have
quieted
my
spirit
in
the
north
country
6
9
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
6
10
take
of
them
of
the
captivity
even
of
heldai
of
tobijah
and
of
jedaiah
which
are
come
from
babylon
and
come
thou
the
same
day
and
go
into
the
house
of
josiah
the
son
of
zephaniah
6
11
then
take
silver
and
gold
and
make
crowns
and
set
them
upon
the
head
of
joshua
the
son
of
josedech
the
high
priest
6
12
and
speak
unto
him
saying
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
saying
behold
the
man
whose
name
is
the
branch
and
he
shall
grow
up
out
of
his
place
and
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
lord
6
13
even
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
bear
the
glory
and
shall
sit
and
rule
upon
his
throne
and
he
shall
be
a
priest
upon
his
throne
and
the
counsel
of
peace
shall
be
between
them
both
6
14
and
the
crowns
shall
be
to
helem
and
to
tobijah
and
to
jedaiah
and
to
hen
the
son
of
zephaniah
for
a
memorial
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
6
15
and
they
that
are
far
off
shall
come
and
build
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
ye
shall
know
that
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
you
and
this
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
will
diligently
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
7
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
darius
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
zechariah
in
the
fourth
day
of
the
ninth
month
even
in
chisleu
7
2
when
they
had
sent
unto
the
house
of
god
sherezer
and
regemmelech
and
their
men
to
pray
before
the
lord
7
3
and
to
speak
unto
the
priests
which
were
in
the
house
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
to
the
prophets
saying
should
i
weep
in
the
fifth
month
separating
myself
as
i
have
done
these
so
many
years
7
4
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
of
hosts
unto
me
saying
7
5
speak
unto
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
to
the
priests
saying
when
ye
fasted
and
mourned
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
month
even
those
seventy
years
did
ye
at
all
fast
unto
me
even
to
me
7
6
and
when
ye
did
eat
and
when
ye
did
drink
did
not
ye
eat
for
yourselves
and
drink
for
yourselves
7
7
should
ye
not
hear
the
words
which
the
lord
hath
cried
by
the
former
prophets
when
jerusalem
was
inhabited
and
in
prosperity
and
the
cities
thereof
round
about
her
when
men
inhabited
the
south
and
the
plain
7
8
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
zechariah
saying
7
9
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
saying
execute
true
judgment
and
shew
mercy
and
compassions
every
man
to
his
brother
7
10
and
oppress
not
the
widow
nor
the
fatherless
the
stranger
nor
the
poor
and
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
against
his
brother
in
your
heart
7
11
but
they
refused
to
hearken
and
pulled
away
the
shoulder
and
stopped
their
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
7
12
yea
they
made
their
hearts
as
an
adamant
stone
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
words
which
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sent
in
his
spirit
by
the
former
prophets
therefore
came
a
great
wrath
from
the
lord
of
hosts
7
13
therefore
it
is
come
to
pass
that
as
he
cried
and
they
would
not
hear
so
they
cried
and
i
would
not
hear
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
7
14
but
i
scattered
them
with
a
whirlwind
among
all
the
nations
whom
they
knew
not
thus
the
land
was
desolate
after
them
that
no
man
passed
through
nor
returned
for
they
laid
the
pleasant
land
desolate
8
1
again
the
word
of
the
lord
of
hosts
came
to
me
saying
8
2
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
was
jealous
for
zion
with
great
jealousy
and
i
was
jealous
for
her
with
great
fury
8
3
thus
saith
the
lord
i
am
returned
unto
zion
and
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
jerusalem
shall
be
called
a
city
of
truth
and
the
mountain
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
holy
mountain
8
4
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
there
shall
yet
old
men
and
old
women
dwell
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
every
man
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
for
very
age
8
5
and
the
streets
of
the
city
shall
be
full
of
boys
and
girls
playing
in
the
streets
thereof
8
6
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
if
it
be
marvellous
in
the
eyes
of
the
remnant
of
this
people
in
these
days
should
it
also
be
marvellous
in
mine
eyes
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
8
7
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
save
my
people
from
the
east
country
and
from
the
west
country
8
8
and
i
will
bring
them
and
they
shall
dwell
in
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
in
truth
and
in
righteousness
8
9
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
let
your
hands
be
strong
ye
that
hear
in
these
days
these
words
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophets
which
were
in
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
lord
of
hosts
was
laid
that
the
temple
might
be
built
8
10
for
before
these
days
there
was
no
hire
for
man
nor
any
hire
for
beast
neither
was
there
any
peace
to
him
that
went
out
or
came
in
because
of
the
affliction
for
i
set
all
men
every
one
against
his
neighbour
8
11
but
now
i
will
not
be
unto
the
residue
of
this
people
as
in
the
former
days
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
8
12
for
the
seed
shall
be
prosperous
the
vine
shall
give
her
fruit
and
the
ground
shall
give
her
increase
and
the
heavens
shall
give
their
dew
and
i
will
cause
the
remnant
of
this
people
to
possess
all
these
things
8
13
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
as
ye
were
a
curse
among
the
heathen
o
house
of
judah
and
house
of
israel
so
will
i
save
you
and
ye
shall
be
a
blessing
fear

for
thus
saith
the

provoked
me
to

days
it
shall
come
to

the

the

for
the
idols
have
spoken
vanity
and
the
diviners
have
seen
a
lie
and
have
told
false
dreams
they
comfort
in
vain
therefore
they
went
their
way
as
a
flock
they
were
troubled
because
there
was
no
shepherd
10
3
mine
anger
was
kindled
against
the
shepherds
and
i
punished
the
goats
for
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
visited
his
flock
the
house
of
judah
and
hath
made
them
as
his
goodly
horse
in
the
battle
10

out
of
him
came
forth
the
corner
out
of
him
the
nail
out
of
him
the
battle
bow
out
of
him
every
oppressor
together
10
5
and
they
shall
be
as
mighty
men
which
tread
down
their
enemies
in
the
mire
of
the
streets
in
the
battle
and
they
shall
fight
because
the
lord
is
with
them
and
the
riders
on
horses
shall
be
confounded
10
6
and
i
will
strengthen
the
house
of
judah
and
i
will
save
the
house
of
joseph
and
i
will
bring
them
again
to
place
them
for
i
have
mercy
upon
them
and
they
shall
be
as
though
i
had
not
cast
them
off
for
i
am
the
lord
their
god
and
will
hear
them
10
7
and
they
of
ephraim
shall
be
like
a
mighty
man
and
their
heart
shall
rejoice
as
through
wine
yea
their
children
shall
see
it
and
be
glad
their
heart
shall
rejoice
in
the
lord
10
8
i
will
hiss
for
them
and
gather
them
for
i
have
redeemed
them
and
they
shall
increase
as
they
have
increased
10
9
and
i
will
sow
them
among
the
people
and
they
shall
remember
me
in
far
countries
and
they
shall
live
with
their
children
and
turn
again
10
10
i
will
bring
them
again
also
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
gather
them
out
of
assyria
and
i
will
bring
them
into
the
land
of
gilead
and
lebanon
and
place
shall
not
be
found
for
them
10
11
and
he
shall
pass
through
the
sea
with
affliction
and
shall
smite
the
waves
in
the
sea
and
all
the
deeps
of
the
river
shall
dry
up
and
the
pride
of
assyria
shall
be
brought
down
and
the
sceptre
of
egypt
shall
depart
away
10
12
and
i
will
strengthen
them
in
the
lord
and
they
shall
walk
up
and
down
in
his
name
saith
the
lord
11
1
open
thy
doors
o
lebanon
that
the
fire
may
devour
thy
cedars
11
2
howl
fir
tree
for
the
cedar
is
fallen
because
the
mighty
are
spoiled
howl
o
ye
oaks
of
bashan
for
the
forest
of
the
vintage
is
come
down
11
3
there
is
a
voice
of
the
howling
of
the
shepherds
for
their
glory
is
spoiled
a
voice
of
the
roaring
of
young
lions
for
the
pride
of
jordan
is
spoiled
11
4
thus
saith
the
lord
my
god
feed
the
flock
of
the
slaughter
11
5
whose
possessors
slay
them
and
hold
themselves
not
guilty
and
they
that
sell
them
say
blessed
be
the
lord
for
i
am
rich
and
their
own
shepherds
pity
them
not
11
6
for
i
will
no
more
pity
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
saith
the
lord
but
lo
i
will
deliver
the
men
every
one
into
his
neighbour’s
hand
and
into
the
hand
of
his
king
and
they
shall
smite
the
land
and
out
of
their
hand
i
will
not
deliver
them
11
7
and
i
will
feed
the
flock
of
slaughter
even
you
o
poor
of
the
flock
and
i
took
unto
me
two
staves
the
one
i
called
beauty
and
the
other
i
called
bands
and
i
fed
the
flock
11
8
three
shepherds
also
i
cut
off
in
one
month
and
my
soul
lothed
them
and
their
soul
also
abhorred
me
11
9
then
said
i
i
will
not
feed
you
that
that
dieth
let
it
die
and
that
that
is
to
be
cut
off
let
it
be
cut
off
and
let
the
rest
eat
every
one
the
flesh
of
another
11
10
and
i
took
my
staff
even
beauty
and
cut
it
asunder
that
i
might
break
my
covenant
which
i
had
made
with
all
the
people
11
11
and
it
was
broken
in
that
day
and
so
the
poor
of
the
flock
that
waited
upon
me
knew
that
it
was
the
word
of
the
lord
11
12
and
i
said
unto
them
if
ye
think
good
give
me
my
price
and
if
not
forbear
so
they
weighed
for
my
price
thirty
pieces
of
silver
11
13
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
cast
it
unto
the
potter
a
goodly
price
that
i
was
prised
at
of
them
and
i
took
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
and
cast
them
to
the
potter
in
the
house
of
the
lord
11
14
then
i
cut
asunder
mine
other
staff
even
bands
that
i
might
break
the
brotherhood
between
judah
and
israel
11
15
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
take
unto
thee
yet
the
instruments
of
a
foolish
shepherd
11
16
for
lo
i
will
raise
up
a
shepherd
in
the
land
which
shall
not
visit
those
that
be
cut
off
neither
shall
seek
the
young
one
nor
heal
that
that
is
broken
nor
feed
that
that
standeth
still
but
he
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
the
fat
and
tear
their
claws
in
pieces
11
17
woe
to
the
idol
shepherd
that
leaveth
the
flock
the
sword
shall
be
upon
his
arm
and
upon
his
right
eye
his
arm
shall
be
clean
dried
up
and
his
right
eye
shall
be
utterly
darkened
12
1
the
burden
of
the
word
of
the
lord
for
israel
saith
the
lord
which
stretcheth
forth
the
heavens
and
layeth
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
formeth
the
spirit
of
man
within
him
12
2
behold
i
will
make
jerusalem
a
cup
of
trembling
unto
all
the
people
round
about
when
they
shall
be
in
the
siege
both
against
judah
and
against
jerusalem
12
3
and
in
that
day
will
i
make
jerusalem
a
burdensome
stone
for
all
people
all
that
burden
themselves
with
it
shall
be
cut
in
pieces
though
all
the
people
of
the
earth
be
gathered
together
against
it
12
4
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
i
will
smite
every
horse
with
astonishment
and
his
rider
with
madness
and
i
will
open
mine
eyes
upon
the
house
of
judah
and
will
smite
every
horse
of
the
people
with
blindness
12
5
and
the
governors
of
judah
shall
say
in
their
heart
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
shall
be
my
strength
in
the
lord
of
hosts
their
god
12
6
in
that
day
will
i
make
the
governors
of
judah
like
an
hearth
of
fire
among
the
wood
and
like
a
torch
of
fire
in
a
sheaf
and
they
shall
devour
all
the
people
round
about
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
and
jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
again
in
her
own
place
even
in
jerusalem
12
7
the
lord
also
shall
save
the
tents
of
judah
first
that
the
glory
of
the
house
of
david
and
the
glory
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
do
not
magnify
themselves
against
judah
12
8
in
that
day
shall
the
lord
defend
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
he
that
is
feeble
among
them
at
that
day
shall
be
as
david
and
the
house
of
david
shall
be
as
god
as
the
angel
of
the
lord
before
them
12
9
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
i
will
seek
to
destroy
all
the
nations
that
come
against
jerusalem
12
10
and
i
will
pour
upon
the
house
of
david
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
the
spirit
of
grace
and
of
supplications
and
they
shall
look
upon
me
whom
they
have
pierced
and
they
shall
mourn
for
him
as
one
mourneth
for
his
only
son
and
shall
be
in
bitterness
for
him
as
one
that
is
in
bitterness
for
his
firstborn
12
11
in
that
day
shall
there
be
a
great
mourning
in
jerusalem
as
the
mourning
of
hadadrimmon
in
the
valley
of
megiddon
12
12
and
the
land
shall
mourn
every
family
apart

apart
the

all
the

13

in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
fountain
opened
to
the
house
of
david
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
for
sin
and
for
uncleanness
13
2
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
i
will
cut
off
the
names
of
the
idols
out
of
the
land
and
they
shall
no
more
be
remembered
and
also
i
will
cause
the
prophets
and
the
unclean
spirit
to
pass
out
of
the
land
13
3
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
any
shall
yet
prophesy
then
his
father
and
his
mother
that
begat
him
shall
say
unto
him
thou
shalt
not

thou
speakest
lies
in

of
the
lord
and
his
father
and
his

that
begat
him
shall
thrust
him
through
when
he
prophesieth
13
4
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
prophets
shall
be
ashamed
every
one
of
his
vision
when
he
hath
prophesied
neither
shall
they
wear
a
rough
garment
to
deceive
13
5
but
he
shall
say
i
am
no
prophet
i
am
an
husbandman
for
man
taught
me
to
keep
cattle
from
my
youth
13
6
and
one
shall
say
unto
him
what
are
these
wounds
in
thine
hands
then
he
shall
answer
those
with
which
i
was
wounded
in
the
house
of
my
friends
13

awake
o
sword
against
my
shepherd
and
against
the
man
that
is
my
fellow

the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered
and
i
will
turn
mine
hand
upon
the
little
ones
13

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
in
all
the
land
saith
the
lord
two
parts
therein
shall
be
cut
off
and
die
but
the
third
shall
be
left
therein
13
9
and
i
will
bring
the
third
part
through
the
fire
and
will
refine
them
as
silver
is
refined
and
will
try
them
as
gold
is
tried
they
shall
call
on
my
name
and
i
will
hear
them
i
will
say
it
is
my
people
and
they
shall
say
the
lord
is
my
god
14
1
behold
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
and
thy
spoil
shall
be
divided
in
the
midst
of
thee
14
2
for
i
will
gather
all
nations
against
jerusalem
to
battle
and
the
city
shall
be
taken
and
the
houses
rifled
and
the
women
ravished
and
half
of
the
city
shall
go
forth
into
captivity
and
the
residue
of
the
people
shall
not
be
cut
off
from
the
city
14
3
then
shall
the
lord
go
forth
and
fight
against
those
nations
as
when
he
fought
in
the
day
of
battle
14
4
and
his
feet
shall
stand
in
that
day
upon
the
mount
of
olives
which
is
before
jerusalem
on
the
east
and
the
mount
of
olives
shall
cleave
in
the
midst
thereof
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
valley
and
half
of
the
mountain
shall
remove
toward
the
north
and
half
of
it
toward
the
south
14
5
and
ye
shall
flee
to
the
valley
of
the
mountains
for
the
valley
of
the
mountains
shall
reach
unto
azal
yea
ye
shall
flee
like
as
ye
fled
from
before
the
earthquake
in
the
days
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
and
the
lord
my
god
shall
come
and
all
the
saints
with
thee
14
6
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
light
shall
not
be
clear
nor
dark
14
7
but
it
shall
be
one
day
which
shall
be
known
to
the
lord
not
day
nor
night
but
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
at
evening
time
it
shall
be
light
14
8
and
it
shall
be
in
that
day
that
living
waters
shall
go
out
from
jerusalem
half
of
them
toward
the
former
sea
and
half
of
them
toward
the
hinder
sea
in
summer
and
in
winter
shall
it
be
14
9
and
the
lord
shall
be
king
over
all
the
earth
in
that
day
shall
there
be
one
lord
and
his
name
one
14
10
all
the
land
shall
be
turned
as
a
plain
from
geba
to
rimmon
south
of
jerusalem
and
it
shall
be
lifted
up
and
inhabited
in
her
place
from
benjamin’s
gate
unto
the
place
of
the
first
gate
unto
the
corner
gate
and
from
the
tower
of
hananeel
unto
the
king’s
winepresses
14
11
and
men
shall
dwell
in
it
and
there
shall
be
no
more
utter
destruction
but
jerusalem
shall
be
safely
inhabited
14
12
and
this
shall
be
the
plague
wherewith
the
lord
will
smite
all
the
people
that
have
fought
against
jerusalem
their
flesh
shall
consume
away
while
they
stand
upon
their
feet
and
their
eyes
shall
consume
away
in
their
holes
and
their
tongue
shall
consume
away
in
their
mouth
14
13
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
a
great
tumult
from
the
lord
shall
be
among
them
and
they
shall
lay
hold
every
one
on
the
hand
of
his
neighbour
and
his
hand
shall
rise
up
against
the
hand
of
his
neighbour
14
14
and
judah
also
shall
fight
at
jerusalem
and
the
wealth
of
all
the
heathen
round
about
shall
be
gathered
together
gold
and
silver
and
apparel
in
great
abundance
14
15
and
so
shall
be
the
plague
of
the
horse
of
the
mule
of
the
camel
and
of
the
ass
and
of
all
the
beasts
that
shall
be
in
these
tents
as
this
plague
14
16
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
one
that
is
left
of
all
the
nations
which
came
against
jerusalem
shall
even
go
up
from
year
to
year
to
worship
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
and
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles
14
17
and
it
shall
be
that
whoso
will
not
come
up
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
unto
jerusalem
to
worship
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
even
upon
them
shall
be
no
rain
14
18
and
if
the
family
of
egypt
go
not
up
and
come
not
that
have
no
rain
there
shall
be
the
plague
wherewith
the
lord
will
smite
the
heathen
that
come
not
up
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles
14
19
this
shall
be
the
punishment
of
egypt
and
the
punishment
of
all
nations
that
come
not
up
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles
14
20
in
that
day
shall
there
be
upon
the
bells
of
the
horses
holiness
unto
the
lord
and
the
pots
in
the
lord’s
house
shall
be
like
the
bowls
before
the
altar
14
21
yea
every
pot
in
jerusalem
and
in
judah
shall
be
holiness
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
and
all
they
that
sacrifice
shall
come
and
take
of
them
and
seethe
therein
and
in
that
day
there
shall
be
no
more
the
canaanite
in
the
house
of
the
lord
of
hosts

i

you
saith
the
lord
yet
ye

wherein
hast
thou

us
was
not
esau
jacob’s
brother
saith
the
lord
yet
i
loved
jacob

and
i
hated
esau
and
laid
his
mountains
and
his
heritage
waste
for
the
dragons
of
the
wilderness
1

whereas
edom
saith
we
are
impoverished
but
we
will
return
and
build
the
desolate
places
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
they
shall
build
but
i
will
throw
down
and
they
shall
call
them
the
border
of
wickedness
and
the
people
against
whom
the
lord
hath
indignation
for
ever
1
5
and
your
eyes
shall
see
and
ye
shall
say
the
lord
will
be
magnified
from
the
border
of
israel
1

a
son
honoureth
his
father
and
a
servant
his
master
if
then
i
be
a
father
where
is
mine
honour
and
if
i
be
a
master
where
is
my
fear
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
unto
you
o
priests
that
despise
my
name
and
ye
say
wherein
have
we
despised
thy
name
1
7
ye
offer
polluted
bread
upon
mine
altar
and
ye
say
wherein
have
we
polluted
thee
in
that
ye
say
the
table
of
the
lord
is
contemptible
1
8
and
if
ye
offer
the
blind
for
sacrifice
is
it
not
evil
and
if
ye
offer
the
lame
and
sick
is
it
not
evil
offer
it
now
unto
thy
governor
will
he
be
pleased
with
thee
or
accept
thy
person
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
1
9
and
now
i
pray
you
beseech
god
that
he
will
be
gracious
unto
us
this
hath
been
by
your
means
will
he
regard
your
persons
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
1
10
who
is
there
even
among
you
that
would
shut
the
doors
for
nought
neither
do
ye
kindle
fire
on
mine
altar
for
nought
i
have
no
pleasure
in
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
neither
will
i
accept
an
offering
at
your
hand
1
11
for
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
even
unto
the
going
down
of
the
same
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
gentiles
and
in
every
place
incense
shall
be
offered
unto
my
name
and
a
pure
offering
for
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
heathen
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
1
12
but
ye
have
profaned
it
in
that
ye
say
the
table
of
the
lord
is
polluted
and
the
fruit
thereof
even
his
meat
is
contemptible
1
13
ye
said
also
behold
what
a
weariness
is
it
and
ye
have
snuffed
at
it
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
ye
brought
that
which
was
torn
and
the
lame
and
the
sick
thus
ye
brought
an
offering
should
i
accept
this
of
your
hand
saith
the
lord
1
14
but
cursed
be
the
deceiver
which
hath
in
his
flock
a
male
and
voweth
and
sacrificeth
unto
the
lord
a
corrupt
thing
for
i
am
a
great
king
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
my
name
is
dreadful
among
the
heathen
2
1
and
now
o
ye
priests
this
commandment
is
for
you
2
2
if
ye
will
not
hear
and
if
ye
will
not
lay
it
to
heart
to
give
glory
unto
my
name
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
will
even
send
a
curse
upon
you
and
i
will
curse
your
blessings
yea
i
have
cursed
them
already
because
ye
do
not
lay
it
to
heart
2
3
behold
i
will
corrupt
your
seed
and
spread
dung
upon
your
faces
even
the
dung
of
your
solemn
feasts
and
one
shall
take
you
away
with
it
2
4
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
have
sent
this
commandment
unto
you
that
my
covenant
might
be
with
levi
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
2
5
my
covenant
was
with
him
of
life
and
peace
and
i
gave
them
to
him
for
the
fear
wherewith
he
feared
me
and
was
afraid
before
my
name
2
6
the
law
of
truth
was
in
his
mouth
and
iniquity
was
not
found
in
his
lips
he
walked
with
me
in
peace
and
equity
and
did
turn
many
away
from
iniquity
2
7
for
the
priest’s
lips
should
keep
knowledge
and
they
should
seek
the
law
at
his
mouth
for
he
is
the
messenger
of
the
lord
of
hosts
2
8
but
ye
are
departed
out
of
the
way
ye
have
caused
many
to
stumble
at
the
law
ye
have
corrupted
the
covenant
of
levi
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
2
9
therefore
have
i
also
made
you
contemptible
and
base
before
all
the
people
according
as
ye
have
not
kept
my
ways
but
have
been
partial
in
the
law
2
10
have
we
not
all
one
father
hath
not
one
god
created
us
why
do
we
deal
treacherously
every
man
against
his
brother
by
profaning
the
covenant
of
our
fathers
2
11
judah
hath
dealt
treacherously
and
an
abomination
is
committed
in
israel
and
in
jerusalem
for
judah
hath
profaned
the
holiness
of
the
lord
which
he
loved
and
hath
married
the
daughter
of
a
strange
god
2
12
the
lord
will
cut
off
the
man
that
doeth
this
the
master
and
the
scholar
out
of
the
tabernacles
of
jacob
and
him
that
offereth
an
offering
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
2
13
and
this
have
ye
done
again
covering
the
altar
of
the
lord
with
tears
with
weeping
and
with
crying
out
insomuch
that
he
regardeth
not
the
offering
any
more
or
receiveth
it
with
good
will
at
your
hand
2
14
yet
ye
say
wherefore
because
the
lord
hath
been
witness
between
thee
and
the
wife
of
thy
youth
against
whom
thou
hast
dealt
treacherously
yet
is
she
thy
companion
and
the
wife
of
thy
covenant
2
15
and
did
not
he
make
one
yet
had
he
the
residue
of
the
spirit
and
wherefore
one
that
he
might
seek
a
godly
seed
therefore
take
heed
to
your
spirit
and
let
none
deal
treacherously
against
the
wife
of
his
youth
2
16
for
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
saith
that
he
hateth
putting
away
for
one
covereth
violence
with
his
garment
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
therefore
take
heed
to
your
spirit
that
ye
deal
not
treacherously
2
17
ye
have
wearied
the
lord
with
your
words
yet
ye
say
wherein
have
we
wearied
him
when
ye
say
every
one
that
doeth
evil
is
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
he
delighteth
in
them
or
where
is
the
god
of
judgment
3
1
behold
i
will
send
my
messenger
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me
and
the
lord
whom
ye
seek
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
even
the
messenger
of
the
covenant
whom
ye
delight
in
behold
he
shall
come
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
3
2
but
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appeareth
for
he
is
like
a
refiner’s
fire
and
like
fullers’
soap
3
3
and
he
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifier
of
silver
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
levi
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
lord
an
offering
in
righteousness
3
4
then
shall
the
offering
of
judah
and
jerusalem
be
pleasant
unto
the
lord
as
in
the
days
of
old
and
as
in
former
years
3
5
and
i
will
come
near
to
you
to
judgment
and
i
will
be
a
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers
and
against
the
adulterers
and
against
false
swearers
and
against
those
that
oppress
the
hireling
in
his
wages
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
that
turn
aside
the
stranger
from
his
right
and
fear
not
me
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
3
6
for
i
am
the
lord
i
change
not
therefore
ye
sons
of
jacob
are
not
consumed
3
7
even
from
the
days
of
your
fathers
ye
are
gone
away
from
mine
ordinances
and
have
not
kept
them
return
unto
me
and
i
will
return
unto
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
but
ye
said
wherein
shall
we
return
3
8
will
a
man
rob
god
yet
ye
have
robbed
me
but
ye
say
wherein
have
we
robbed
thee
in
tithes
and
offerings
3
9
ye
are
cursed
with
a
curse
for
ye
have
robbed
me
even
this
whole
nation
3
10
bring
ye
all
the
tithes
into
the
storehouse
that
there
may
be
meat
in
mine
house
and
prove
me
now
herewith
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
if
i
will
not
open
you
the
windows
of
heaven
and
pour
you
out
a
blessing
that
there
shall
not
be
room
enough
to
receive
it
3
11
and
i
will
rebuke
the
devourer
for
your
sakes
and
he
shall
not
destroy
the
fruits
of
your
ground
neither
shall
your
vine
cast
her
fruit
before
the
time
in
the
field
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
3
12
and
all
nations
shall
call
you
blessed
for
ye
shall
be
a
delightsome
land
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
3
13
your
words
have
been
stout
against
me
saith
the
lord
yet
ye
say
what
have
we
spoken
so
much
against
thee
3
14
ye
have
said
it
is
vain
to
serve
god
and
what
profit
is
it
that
we
have
kept
his
ordinance
and
that
we
have
walked
mournfully
before
the
lord
of
hosts
3
15
and
now
we
call
the
proud
happy
yea
they
that
work
wickedness
are
set
up
yea
they
that
tempt
god
are
even
delivered
3
16
then
they
that
feared
the
lord
spake
often
one
to
another
and
the
lord
hearkened
and
heard
it
and
a
book
of
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
the
lord
and
that
thought
upon
his
name
3
17
and
they
shall
be
mine
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
in
that
day
when
i
make
up
my
jewels
and
i
will
spare
them
as
a
man
spareth
his
own
son
that
serveth
him
3
18
then
shall
ye
return
and
discern
between
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
between
him
that
serveth
god
and
him
that
serveth
him
not
4
1
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be

unto

are

1
18
now
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
was
on
this
wise
when
as
his
mother
mary
was
espoused
to
joseph
before
they
came
together
she
was
found
with
child
of
the
holy
ghost
1
19
then
joseph
her
husband
being
a
just
man
and
not
willing
to
make
her
a
publick
example
was
minded
to
put
her
away
privily
1
20
but
while
he
thought
on
these
things
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream
saying
joseph
thou
son
of
david
fear
not
to
take
unto
thee
mary
thy
wife
for
that
which
is
conceived
in
her
is
of
the
holy
ghost
1
21
and
she
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
sins
1
22
now
all
this
was
done
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
saying
1
23
behold
a
virgin
shall
be
with
child
and
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
they
shall
call
his
name
emmanuel
which
being
interpreted
is
god
with
us
1
24
then
joseph
being
raised
from
sleep
did
as
the
angel
of
the
lord
had
bidden
him
and
took
unto
him
his
wife
1
25
and
knew
her
not
till
she
had
brought
forth
her
firstborn
son
and
he
called
his
name
jesus
2
1
now
when
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
of
judaea
in
the
days
of
herod
the
king
behold
there
came
wise
men
from
the
east
to
jerusalem
2
2
saying
where
is
he
that
is
born
king
of
the
jews
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
are
come
to
worship
him
2
3
when
herod
the
king
had
heard
these
things
he
was
troubled
and
all
jerusalem
with
him
2
4
and
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
together
he
demanded
of
them
where
christ
should
be
born
2
5
and
they
said
unto
him
in
bethlehem
of
judaea
for
thus
it
is
written
by
the
prophet
2
6
and
thou
bethlehem
in
the
land
of
juda
art
not
the
least
among
the
princes
of
juda
for
out
of
thee
shall
come
a
governor
that
shall
rule
my
people
israel
2
7
then
herod
when
he
had
privily
called
the
wise
men
enquired
of
them
diligently
what
time
the
star
appeared
2
8
and
he
sent
them
to
bethlehem
and
said
go
and
search
diligently
for
the
young
child
and
when
ye
have
found
him
bring
me
word
again
that
i
may
come
and
worship
him
also
2
9
when
they
had
heard
the
king
they
departed
and
lo
the
star
which
they
saw
in
the
east
went
before
them
till
it
came
and
stood
over
where
the
young
child
was
2
10
when
they
saw
the
star
they
rejoiced
with
exceeding
great
joy
2
11
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
house
they
saw
the
young
child
with
mary
his
mother
and
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
and
when
they
had
opened
their
treasures
they
presented
unto
him
gifts
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
2
12
and
being
warned
of
god
in
a
dream
that
they
should
not
return
to
herod
they
departed
into
their
own
country
another
way
2
13
and
when
they
were
departed
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeareth
to
joseph
in
a
dream
saying
arise
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
flee
into
egypt
and
be
thou
there
until
i
bring
thee
word
for
herod
will
seek
the
young
child
to
destroy
him
2
14
when
he
arose
he
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother
by
night
and
departed
into
egypt
2
15
and
was
there
until
the
death
of
herod
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
saying
out
of
egypt
have
i
called
my
son
2
16
then
herod
when
he
saw
that
he
was
mocked
of
the
wise
men
was
exceeding
wroth
and
sent
forth
and
slew
all
the
children
that
were
in
bethlehem
and
in
all
the
coasts
thereof
from
two
years
old
and
under
according
to
the
time
which
he
had
diligently
enquired
of
the
wise
men
2
17
then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
jeremy
the
prophet
saying
2
18
in
rama
was
there
a
voice
heard
lamentation
and
weeping
and
great
mourning
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
and
would
not
be
comforted
because
they
are
not
2
19
but
when
herod
was
dead
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeareth
in
a
dream
to
joseph
in
egypt
2
20
saying
arise
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
go
into
the
land
of
israel
for
they
are
dead
which
sought
the
young
child’s
life
2
21
and
he
arose
and
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
came
into
the
land
of
israel
2
22
but
when
he
heard
that
archelaus
did
reign
in
judaea
in
the
room
of
his
father
herod
he
was
afraid
to
go
thither
notwithstanding
being
warned
of
god
in
a
dream
he
turned
aside
into
the
parts
of
galilee
2
23
and
he
came
and
dwelt
in
a
city
called
nazareth
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophets
he
shall
be
called
a
nazarene
3
1
in
those
days
came
john
the
baptist
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
judaea
3
2
and
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
3
3
for
this
is
he
that
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
esaias
saying
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
straight
3
4
and
the
same
john
had
his
raiment
of
camel’s
hair
and
a
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
and
his
meat
was
locusts
and
wild
honey
3
5
then
went
out
to
him
jerusalem
and
all
judaea
and
all
the
region
round
about
jordan
3
6
and
were
baptized
of
him
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
3
7
but
when
he
saw
many
of
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
come
to
his
baptism
he
said
unto
them
o
generation
of
vipers
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
3
8
bring
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
repentance
3
9
and
think
not
to
say
within
yourselves
we
have
abraham
to
our
father
for
i
say
unto
you
that
god
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
abraham
3
10
and
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees
therefore
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
3
11
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
repentance
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
3
12
whose
fan
is
in
his
hand
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor
and
gather
his
wheat
into
the
garner
but
he
will
burn
up
the
chaff
with
unquenchable
fire
3
13
then
cometh
jesus
from
galilee
to
jordan
unto
john
to
be
baptized
of
him
3
14
but
john
forbad
him
saying
i
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
3
15
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
suffer
it
to
be
so
now
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
then
he
suffered
him
3
16
and
jesus
when
he
was
baptized
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water
and
lo
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
and
he
saw
the
spirit
of
god
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
3
17
and
lo
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
4
1
then
was
jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
4
2
and
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights
he
was
afterward
an
hungred
4
3
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread
4
4
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
written
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
4
5
then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
4
6
and
saith
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
4
7
jesus
said
unto
him
it
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
4
8
again
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
sheweth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
4
9
and
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
4
10
then
saith
jesus
unto
him
get
thee
hence
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
4
11
then
the
devil
leaveth
him
and
behold
angels
came
and
ministered
unto
him
4
12
now
when
jesus
had
heard
that
john
was
cast
into
prison
he
departed
into
galilee
4
13
and
leaving
nazareth
he
came
and
dwelt
in
capernaum
which
is
upon
the
sea
coast
in
the
borders
of
zabulon
and
nephthalim
4
14
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
prophet
saying
4
15
the
land
of
zabulon
and
the
land
of
nephthalim
by
the
way
of
the
sea
beyond
jordan
galilee
of
the
gentiles
4
16
the
people
which
sat
in
darkness
saw
great
light
and
to
them
which
sat
in
the
region
and
shadow
of
death
light
is
sprung
up
4
17
from
that
time
jesus
began
to
preach
and
to
say
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
4
18
and
jesus
walking
by
the
sea
of
galilee
saw
two
brethren
simon
called
peter
and
andrew
his
brother
casting
a
net
into
the
sea
for
they
were
fishers
4
19
and
he
saith
unto
them
follow
me
and
i
will
make
you
fishers
of
men
4
20
and
they
straightway
left
their
nets
and
followed
him
4
21
and
going
on
from
thence
he
saw
other
two
brethren
james
the
son
of
zebedee
and
john
his
brother
in
a
ship
with
zebedee
their
father
mending
their
nets
and
he
called
them
4
22
and
they
immediately
left
the
ship
and
their
father
and
followed
him
4
23
and
jesus
went
about
all
galilee
teaching
in
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
and
healing
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease
among
the
people
4
24
and
his
fame
went
throughout
all
syria
and
they
brought
unto
him
all
sick
people
that
were
taken
with
divers
diseases
and
torments
and
those
which
were
possessed
with
devils
and
those
which
were
lunatick
and
those
that
had
the
palsy
and
he
healed
them
4
25
and
there
followed
him
great
multitudes
of
people
from
galilee
and
from
decapolis
and
from
jerusalem
and
from
judaea
and
from
beyond
jordan
5
1
and
seeing
the
multitudes
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
and
when
he
was
set
his
disciples
came
unto
him
5
2
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
taught
them
saying
5
3
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
5
4
blessed

revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
5
12
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
which
were
before
you
5
13
ye
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
savour
wherewith
shall
it
be
salted
it
is
thenceforth
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
cast
out
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
men
5
14
ye
are
the
light
of
the
world
a
city
that
is
set
on
an
hill
cannot
be
hid
5
15
neither
do
men
light
a
candle
and
put
it
under
a
bushel
but
on
a
candlestick
and
it
giveth
light
unto
all
that
are
in
the
house
5
16
let
your
light
so
shine
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
5
17
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
destroy
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
fulfil
5
18
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
till
heaven
and
earth
pass
one
jot
or
one
tittle
shall
in
no
wise
pass
from
the
law
till
all
be
fulfilled
5
19
whosoever
therefore
shall
break
one
of
these
least
commandments
and
shall
teach
men
so
he
shall
be
called
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whosoever
shall
do
and
teach
them
the
same
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
5
20
for
i
say
unto
you
that
except
your
righteousness
shall
exceed
the
righteousness
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
ye
shall
in
no
case
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
5
21
ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
whosoever
shall
kill
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment
5
22
but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
without
a
cause
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment
and
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother
raca
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
council
but
whosoever
shall
say
thou
fool
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
fire
5
23
therefore
if
thou
bring
thy
gift
to
the
altar
and
there
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hath
ought
against
thee
5
24
leave
there
thy
gift
before
the
altar
and
go
thy
way
first
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother
and
then
come
and
offer
thy
gift
5
25
agree
with
thine
adversary
quickly
whiles
thou
art
in
the
way
with
him
lest
at
any
time
the
adversary
deliver
thee
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer
and
thou
be
cast
into
prison
5
26
verily
i
say
unto
thee
thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence
till
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
farthing
5
27
ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
5
28
but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
heart
5
29
and
if
thy
right
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
out
and
cast
it
from
thee
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
perish
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
hell
5
30
and
if
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
and
cast
it
from
thee
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
perish
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
hell
5
31
it
hath
been
said
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
let
him
give
her
a
writing
of
divorcement
5
32
but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
saving
for
the
cause
of
fornication
causeth
her
to
commit
adultery
and
whosoever
shall
marry
her
that
is
divorced
committeth
adultery
5
33
again
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
lord
thine
oaths
5
34
but
i
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
neither
by
heaven
for
it
is
god’s
throne
5
35
nor
by
the
earth
for
it
is
his
footstool
neither
by
jerusalem
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
great
king
5
36
neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
head
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
white
or
black
5
37
but
let
your
communication
be
yea
yea
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
evil
5
38
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
5
39
but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
5
40
and
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
and
take
away
thy
coat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
5
41
and
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
mile
go
with
him
twain
5
42
give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
and
from
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
not
thou
away
5
43
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
and
hate
thine
enemy
5
44
but
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
5
45
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
5
46
for
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you
what
reward
have
ye
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
same
5
47
and
if
ye
salute
your
brethren
only
what
do
ye
more
than
others
do
not
even
the
publicans
so
5
48
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
6
1
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
men
to
be
seen
of
them
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
6
2
therefore
when
thou
doest
thine
alms
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
thee
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward
6
3
but
when
thou
doest
alms
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth
6
4
that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly
6
5
and
when
thou
prayest
thou
shalt
not
be
as
the
hypocrites
are
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
corners
of
the
streets
that
they
may
be
seen
of
men
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward
6
6
but
thou
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly
6
7
but
when
ye
pray
use
not
vain
repetitions
as
the
heathen
do
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking
6
8
be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
them
for
your
father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
of
before
ye
ask
him
6
9
after
this
manner
therefore
pray
ye
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
6
10
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
6
11
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
6
12
and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
6
13
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
for
ever
amen
6
14
for
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
you
6
15
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
trespasses
6
16
moreover
when
ye
fast
be
not
as
the
hypocrites
of
a
sad
countenance
for
they
disfigure
their
faces
that
they
may
appear
unto
men
to
fast
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward
6
17
but
thou
when
thou
fastest
anoint
thine
head
and
wash
thy
face
6
18
that
thou
appear
not
unto
men
to
fast
but
unto
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly
6
19
lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth
where
moth
and
rust
doth
corrupt
and
where
thieves
break
through
and
steal
6
20
but
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
and
where
thieves
do
not
break
through
nor
steal
6
21
for
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
6
22
the
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
if
therefore
thine
eye
be
single
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
light
6
23
but
if
thine
eye
be
evil
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
darkness
if
therefore
the
light
that
is
in
thee
be
darkness
how
great
is
that
darkness
6
24
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
ye
cannot
serve
god
and
mammon
6
25
therefore
i
say
unto
you
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
nor
yet
for
your
body
what
ye
shall
put
on
is
not
the
life
more
than
meat
and
the
body
than
raiment
6
26
behold
the
fowls
of
the
air
for
they
sow
not
neither
do
they
reap
nor
gather
into
barns
yet
your
heavenly
father
feedeth
them
are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
6
27
which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
his
stature
6
28
and
why
take
ye
thought
for
raiment
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
6
29
and
yet
i
say
unto
you
that
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
6
30
wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
to
day
is
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
shall
he
not
much
more
clothe
you
o
ye
of
little
faith
6
31
therefore
take
no
thought
saying
what
shall
we
eat
or
what
shall
we
drink
or
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
6
32
(for
after
all
these
things
do
the
gentiles
seek
)
for
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things
6
33
but
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
6
34
take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
7
1
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
7
2
for
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
7
3
and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother’s
eye
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
7
4
or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
brother
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye
and
behold
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye
7
5
thou
hypocrite
first
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
brother’s
eye
7
6
give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet
and
turn
again
and
rend
you
7
7
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
7
8
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened
7
9
or
what
man
is
there
of
you
whom
if
his
son
ask
bread
will
he
give
him
a
stone
7
10
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
7
11
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
7
12
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
7
13
enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
wide
is
the
gate
and
broad
is
the
way
that
leadeth
to
destruction
and
many
there
be
which
go
in
thereat
7
14
because
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
which
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
7
15
beware
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheep’s
clothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
7
16
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
7
17
even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit
7
18
a
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit
neither
can
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit
7
19
every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
7
20
wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
7
21
not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
7
22
many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day
lord
lord
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works
7
23
and
then
will
i
profess
unto
them
i
never
knew
you
depart
from
me
ye
that
work
iniquity
7
24
therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
i
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man
which
built
his
house
upon
a
rock
7
25
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock
7
26
and
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man
which
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
7
27
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it
7
28
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
7
29
for
he
taught
them
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
8
1
when
he
was
come
down
from
the
mountain
great
multitudes
followed
him
8
2
and
behold
there
came
a
leper
and
worshipped
him
saying
lord
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
me
clean
8
3
and
jesus
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
i
will
be
thou
clean
and
immediately
his
leprosy
was
cleansed
8
4
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
see
thou
tell
no
man
but
go
thy
way
shew
thyself
to
the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
moses
commanded
for
a
testimony
unto
them
8
5
and
when
jesus
was
entered
into
capernaum
there
came
unto
him
a
centurion
beseeching
him
8
6
and
saying
lord
my
servant
lieth
at
home
sick
of
the
palsy
grievously
tormented
8
7
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
i
will
come
and
heal
him
8
8
the
centurion
answered
and
said
lord
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
roof
but
speak
the
word
only
and
my
servant
shall
be
healed
8
9
for
i
am
a
man
under
authority
having
soldiers
under
me
and
i
say
to
this
man
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
another
come
and
he
cometh
and
to
my
servant
do
this
and
he
doeth
it
8
10
when
jesus
heard
it
he
marvelled
and
said
to
them
that
followed
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
israel
8
11
and
i
say
unto
you
that
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
west
and
shall
sit
down
with
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
8
12
but
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
8
13
and
jesus
said
unto
the
centurion
go
thy
way
and
as
thou
hast
believed
so
be
it
done
unto
thee
and
his
servant
was
healed
in
the
selfsame
hour
8
14
and
when
jesus
was
come
into
peter’s
house
he
saw
his
wife’s
mother
laid
and
sick
of
a
fever
8
15
and
he
touched
her
hand
and
the
fever
left
her
and
she
arose
and
ministered
unto
them
8
16
when
the
even
was
come
they
brought
unto
him
many
that
were
possessed
with
devils
and
he
cast
out
the
spirits
with
his
word
and
healed
all
that
were
sick
8
17
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
prophet
saying
himself
took
our
infirmities
and
bare
our
sicknesses
8
18
now
when
jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
him
he
gave
commandment
to
depart
unto
the
other
side
8
19
and
a
certain
scribe
came
and
said
unto
him
master
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
8
20
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
8
21
and
another
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him
lord
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father
8
22
but
jesus
said
unto
him
follow
me
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
8
23
and
when
he
was
entered
into
a
ship
his
disciples
followed
him
8
24
and
behold
there
arose
a
great
tempest
in
the
sea
insomuch
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
the
waves
but
he
was
asleep
8
25
and
his
disciples
came
to
him
and
awoke
him
saying
lord
save
us
we
perish
8
26
and
he
saith
unto
them
why
are
ye
fearful
o
ye
of
little
faith
then
he
arose
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
there
was
a
great
calm
8
27
but
the
men
marvelled
saying
what
manner
of
man
is
this
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
him
8
28
and
when
he
was
come
to
the
other
side
into
the
country
of
the
gergesenes
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
devils
coming
out
of
the
tombs
exceeding
fierce
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
way
8
29
and
behold
they
cried
out
saying
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee
jesus
thou
son
of
god
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time
8
30
and
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
an
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
8
31
so
the
devils
besought
him
saying
if
thou
cast
us
out
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
swine
8
32
and
he
said
unto
them
go
and
when
they
were
come
out
they
went
into
the
herd
of
swine
and
behold
the
whole
herd
of
swine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
and
perished
in
the
waters
8
33
and
they
that
kept
them
fled
and
went
their
ways
into
the
city
and
told
every
thing
and
what
was
befallen
to
the
possessed
of
the
devils
8
34
and
behold
the
whole
city
came
out
to
meet
jesus
and
when
they
saw
him
they
besought
him
that
he
would
depart
out
of
their
coasts
9
1
and
he
entered
into
a
ship
and
passed
over
and
came
into
his
own
city
9
2
and
behold
they
brought
to
him
a
man
sick
of
the
palsy
lying
on
a
bed
and
jesus
seeing
their
faith
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy
son
be
of
good
cheer
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
9
3
and
behold
certain
of
the
scribes
said
within
themselves
this
man
blasphemeth
9
4
and
jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
said
wherefore
think
ye
evil
in
your
hearts
9
5
for
whether
is
easier
to
say
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
or
to
say
arise
and
walk
9
6
but
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
sins
(then
saith
he
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy
)
arise
take
up
thy
bed
and
go
unto
thine
house
9
7
and
he
arose
and
departed
to
his
house
9
8
but
when
the
multitudes
saw
it
they
marvelled
and
glorified
god
which
had
given
such
power
unto
men
9
9
and
as
jesus
passed
forth
from
thence
he
saw
a
man
named
matthew
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom
and
he
saith
unto
him
follow
me
and
he
arose
and
followed
him
9
10
and
it
came
to
pass
as
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
house
behold
many
publicans
and
sinners
came
and
sat
down
with
him
and
his
disciples
9
11
and
when
the
pharisees
saw
it
they
said
unto
his
disciples
why
eateth
your
master
with
publicans
and
sinners
9
12
but
when
jesus
heard
that
he
said
unto
them
they
that
be
whole
need
not
a
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
9
13
but
go
ye
and
learn
what
that
meaneth
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
for
i
am
not
come
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
9
14
then
came
to
him
the
disciples
of
john
saying
why
do
we
and
the
pharisees
fast
oft
but
thy
disciples
fast
not
9
15
and
jesus
said
unto
them
can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
mourn
as
long
as
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
but
the
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
from
them
and
then
shall
they
fast
9
16
no
man
putteth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
unto
an
old
garment
for
that
which
is
put
in
to
fill
it
up
taketh
from
the
garment
and
the
rent
is
made
worse
9
17
neither
do
men
put
new
wine
into
old
bottles
else
the
bottles
break
and
the
wine
runneth
out
and
the
bottles
perish
but
they
put
new
wine
into
new
bottles
and
both
are
preserved
9
18
while
he
spake
these
things
unto
them
behold
there
came
a
certain
ruler
and
worshipped
him
saying
my
daughter
is
even
now
dead
but
come
and
lay
thy
hand
upon
her
and
she
shall
live
9
19
and
jesus
arose
and
followed
him
and
so
did
his
disciples
9
20
and
behold
a
woman
which
was
diseased
with
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years
came
behind
him
and
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment
9
21
for
she
said
within
herself
if
i
may
but
touch
his
garment
i
shall
be
whole
9
22
but
jesus
turned
him
about
and
when
he
saw
her
he
said
daughter
be
of
good
comfort
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
and
the
woman
was
made
whole
from
that
hour
9
23
and
when
jesus
came
into
the
ruler’s
house
and
saw
the
minstrels
and
the
people
making
a
noise
9
24
he
said
unto
them
give
place
for
the
maid
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
and
they
laughed
him
to
scorn
9
25
but
when
the
people
were
put
forth
he
went
in
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
the
maid
arose
9
26
and
the
fame
hereof
went
abroad
into
all
that
land
9
27
and
when
jesus
departed
thence
two
blind
men
followed
him
crying
and
saying
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
us
9
28
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
the
blind
men
came
to
him
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
believe
ye
that
i
am
able
to
do
this
they
said
unto
him
yea
lord
9
29
then
touched
he
their
eyes
saying
according
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
you
9
30
and
their
eyes
were
opened
and
jesus
straitly
charged
them
saying
see
that
no
man
know
it
9
31
but
they
when
they
were
departed
spread
abroad
his
fame
in
all
that
country
9
32
as
they
went
out
behold
they
brought
to
him
a
dumb
man
possessed
with
a
devil
9
33
and
when
the
devil
was
cast
out
the
dumb
spake
and
the
multitudes
marvelled
saying
it
was
never
so
seen
in
israel
9
34
but
the
pharisees
said
he
casteth
out
devils
through
the
prince
of
the
devils
9
35
and
jesus
went
about
all
the
cities
and
villages
teaching
in
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
and
healing
every
sickness
and
every
disease
among
the
people
9
36
but
when
he
saw
the
multitudes
he
was
moved
with
compassion
on
them
because
they
fainted
and
were
scattered
abroad
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd
9
37
then
saith
he
unto
his
disciples
the
harvest
truly
is
plenteous
but
the
labourers
are
few
9
38
pray
ye
therefore
the
lord
of
the
harvest
that
he
will
send
forth
labourers
into
his
harvest
10
1
and
when
he
had
called
unto
him
his
twelve
disciples
he
gave
them
power
against
unclean
spirits
to
cast
them
out
and
to
heal
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease
10
2
now
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
are
these
the
first
simon
who
is
called
peter
and
andrew
his
brother
james
the
son
of
zebedee
and
john
his
brother
10
3
philip
and
bartholomew
thomas
and
matthew
the
publican
james
the
son
of
alphaeus
and
lebbaeus
whose
surname
was
thaddaeus
10
4
simon
the
canaanite
and
judas
iscariot
who
also
betrayed
him
10
5
these
twelve
jesus
sent
forth
and
commanded
them
saying
go
not
into
the
way
of
the
gentiles
and
into
any
city
of
the
samaritans
enter
ye
not
10
6
but
go
rather
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
10
7
and
as
ye
go
preach
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
10
8
heal
the
sick
cleanse
the
lepers
raise
the
dead
cast
out
devils
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
10
9
provide
neither
gold
nor
silver
nor
brass
in
your
purses
10
10
nor
scrip
for
your
journey
neither
two
coats
neither
shoes
nor
yet
staves
for
the
workman
is
worthy
of
his
meat
10
11
and
into
whatsoever
city
or
town
ye
shall
enter
enquire
who
in
it
is
worthy
and
there
abide
till
ye
go
thence
10
12
and
when
ye
come
into
an
house
salute
it
10
13
and
if
the
house
be
worthy
let
your
peace
come
upon
it
but
if
it
be
not
worthy
let
your
peace
return
to
you
10
14
and
whosoever
shall
not
receive
you
nor
hear
your
words
when
ye
depart
out
of
that
house
or
city
shake
off
the
dust
of
your
feet
10
15
verily
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
that
city
10
16
behold
i
send
you
forth
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of
wolves
be
ye
therefore
wise
as
serpents
and
harmless
as
doves
10
17
but
beware
of
men
for
they
will
deliver
you
up
to
the
councils
and
they
will
scourge
you
in
their
synagogues
10
18
and
ye
shall
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
sake
for
a
testimony
against
them
and
the
gentiles
10
19
but
when
they
deliver
you
up
take
no
thought
how
or
what
ye
shall
speak
for
it
shall
be
given
you
in
that
same
hour
what
ye
shall
speak
10
20
for
it
is
not
ye
that
speak
but
the
spirit
of
your
father
which
speaketh
in
you
10
21
and
the
brother
shall
deliver
up
the
brother
to
death
and
the
father
the
child
and
the
children
shall
rise
up
against
their
parents
and
cause
them
to
be
put
to
death
10
22
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name’s
sake
but
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be
saved
10
23
but
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
city
flee
ye
into
another
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
have
gone
over
the
cities
of
israel
till
the
son
of
man
be
come
10
24
the
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
nor
the
servant
above
his
lord
10
25
it
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
master
and
the
servant
as
his
lord
if
they
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
beelzebub
how
much
more
shall
they
call
them
of
his
household
10
26
fear
them
not
therefore
for
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
revealed
and
hid
that
shall
not
be
known
10
27
what
i
tell
you
in
darkness
that
speak
ye
in
light
and
what
ye
hear
in
the
ear
that
preach
ye
upon
the
housetops
10
28
and
fear
not
them
which
kill
the
body
but
are
not
able
to
kill
the
soul
but
rather
fear
him
which
is
able
to
destroy
both
soul
and
body
in
hell
10
29
are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
a
farthing
and
one
of
them
shall
not
fall
on
the
ground
without
your
father
10
30
but
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
10
31
fear
ye
not
therefore
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
10
32
whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
men
him
will
i
confess
also
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
10
33
but
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
men
him
will
i
also
deny
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
10
34
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
send
peace
on
earth
i
came
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
10
35
for
i
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
against
his
father
and
the
daughter
against
her
mother
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law
10
36
and
a
man’s
foes
shall
be
they
of
his
own
household
10
37
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
10
38
and
he
that
taketh
not
his
cross
and
followeth
after
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
10
39
he
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
10
40
he
that
receiveth
you
receiveth
me
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me
10
41
he
that
receiveth
a
prophet
in
the
name
of
a
prophet
shall
receive
a
prophet’s
reward
and
he
that
receiveth
a
righteous
man
in
the
name
of
a
righteous
man
shall
receive
a
righteous
man’s
reward
10
42
and
whosoever
shall
give
to
drink
unto
one
of
these
little
ones
a
cup
of
cold
water
only
in
the
name
of
a
disciple
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
reward
11
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
twelve
disciples
he
departed
thence
to
teach
and
to
preach
in
their
cities
11
2
now
when
john
had
heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of
christ
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
11
3
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
he
that
should
come
or
do
we
look
for
another
11
4
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
go
and
shew
john
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
see
11
5
the
blind
receive
their
sight
and
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
up
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
11
6
and
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
11
7
and
as
they
departed
jesus
began
to
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
john
what
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
a
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
11
8
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
man
clothed
in
soft
raiment
behold
they
that
wear
soft
clothing
are
in
kings’
houses
11
9
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
prophet
yea
i
say
unto
you
and
more
than
a
prophet
11
10
for
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
behold
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
11
11
verily
i
say
unto
you
among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
john
the
baptist
notwithstanding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
he
11
12
and
from
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
violence
and
the
violent
take
it
by
force
11
13
for
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
john
11
14
and
if
ye
will
receive
it
this
is
elias
which
was
for
to
come
11
15
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
11
16
but
whereunto
shall
i
liken
this
generation
it
is
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
markets
and
calling
unto
their
fellows
11
17
and
saying
we
have
piped
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
danced
we
have
mourned
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
lamented
11
18
for
john
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they
say
he
hath
a
devil
11
19
the
son
of
man
came
eating
and
drinking
and
they
say
behold
a
man
gluttonous
and
a
winebibber
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
but
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
children
11
20
then
began
he
to
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
done
because
they
repented
not
11
21
woe
unto
thee
chorazin
woe
unto
thee
bethsaida
for
if
the
mighty
works
which
were
done
in
you
had
been
done
in
tyre
and
sidon
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
11
22
but
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
tyre
and
sidon
at
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
you
11
23
and
thou
capernaum
which
art
exalted
unto
heaven
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell
for
if
the
mighty
works
which
have
been
done
in
thee
had
been
done
in
sodom
it
would
have
remained
until
this
day
11
24
but
i
say
unto
you
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
thee
11
25
at
that
time
jesus
answered
and
said
i
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
11
26
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
11
27
all
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
father
and
no
man
knoweth
the
son
but
the
father
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
father
save
the
son
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
son
will
reveal
him
11
28
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
11
29
take
my
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
of
me
for
i
am
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls
11
30
for
my
yoke
is
easy
and
my
burden
is
light
12
1
at
that
time
jesus
went
on
the
sabbath
day
through
the
corn
and
his
disciples
were
an
hungred
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn
and
to
eat
12
2
but
when
the
pharisees
saw
it
they
said
unto
him
behold
thy
disciples
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
upon
the
sabbath
day
12
3
but
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
not
read
what
david
did
when
he
was
an
hungred
and
they
that
were
with
him
12
4
how
he
entered
into
the
house
of
god
and
did
eat
the
shewbread
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
eat
neither
for
them
which
were
with
him
but
only
for
the
priests
12
5
or
have
ye
not
read
in
the
law
how
that
on
the
sabbath
days
the
priests
in
the
temple
profane
the
sabbath
and
are
blameless
12
6
but
i
say
unto
you
that
in
this
place
is
one
greater
than
the
temple
12
7
but
if
ye
had
known
what
this
meaneth
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
ye
would
not
have
condemned
the
guiltless
12
8
for
the
son
of
man
is
lord
even
of
the
sabbath
day
12
9
and
when
he
was
departed
thence
he
went
into
their
synagogue
12
10
and
behold
there
was
a
man
which
had
his
hand
withered
and
they
asked
him
saying
is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
days
that
they
might
accuse
him
12
11
and
he
said
unto
them
what
man
shall
there
be
among
you
that
shall
have
one
sheep
and
if
it
fall
into
a
pit
on
the
sabbath
day
will
he
not
lay
hold
on
it
and
lift
it
out
12
12
how
much
then
is
a
man
better
than
a
sheep
wherefore
it
is
lawful
to
do
well
on
the
sabbath
days
12
13
then
saith
he
to
the
man
stretch
forth
thine
hand
and
he
stretched
it
forth
and
it
was
restored
whole
like
as
the
other
12
14
then
the
pharisees
went
out
and
held
a
council
against
him
how
they
might
destroy
him
12
15
but
when
jesus
knew
it
he
withdrew
himself
from
thence
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
he
healed
them
all
12
16
and
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known
12
17
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
prophet
saying
12
18
behold
my
servant
whom
i
have
chosen
my
beloved
in
whom
my
soul
is
well
pleased
i
will
put
my
spirit
upon
him
and
he
shall
shew
judgment
to
the
gentiles
12
19
he
shall
not
strive
nor
cry
neither
shall
any
man
hear
his
voice
in
the
streets
12
20
a
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break
and
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench
till
he
send
forth
judgment
unto
victory
12
21
and
in
his
name
shall
the
gentiles
trust
12
22
then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
a
devil
blind
and
dumb
and
he
healed
him
insomuch
that
the
blind
and
dumb
both
spake
and
saw
12
23
and
all
the
people
were
amazed
and
said
is
not
this
the
son
of
david
12
24
but
when
the
pharisees
heard
it
they
said
this
fellow
doth
not
cast
out
devils
but
by
beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
devils
12
25
and
jesus
knew
their
thoughts
and
said
unto
them
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
desolation
and
every
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
stand
12
26
and
if
satan
cast
out
satan
he
is
divided
against
himself
how
shall
then
his
kingdom
stand
12
27
and
if
i
by
beelzebub
cast
out
devils
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
them
out
therefore
they
shall
be
your
judges
12
28
but
if
i
cast
out
devils
by
the
spirit
of
god
then
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
unto
you
12
29
or
else
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
man’s
house
and
spoil
his
goods
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
man
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
house
12
30
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
abroad
12
31
wherefore
i
say
unto
you
all
manner
of
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
men
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
holy
ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
unto
men
12
32
and
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
son
of
man
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
him
neither
in
this
world
neither
in
the
world
to
come
12
33
either
make
the
tree
good
and
his
fruit
good
or
else
make
the
tree
corrupt
and
his
fruit
corrupt
for
the
tree
is
known
by
his
fruit
12
34
o
generation
of
vipers
how
can
ye
being
evil
speak
good
things
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
12
35
a
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
the
heart
bringeth
forth
good
things
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
evil
things
12
36
but
i
say
unto
you
that
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
speak
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
judgment
12
37
for
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
justified
and
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
condemned
12
38
then
certain
of
the
scribes
and
of
the
pharisees
answered
saying
master
we
would
see
a
sign
from
thee
12
39
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
an
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
to
it
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
jonas
12
40
for
as
jonas
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
whale’s
belly
so
shall
the
son
of
man
be
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
12
41
the
men
of
nineveh
shall
rise
in
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
because
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
jonas
and
behold
a
greater
than
jonas
is
here
12
42
the
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
for
she
came
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
behold
a
greater
than
solomon
is
here
12
43
when
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
man
he
walketh
through
dry
places
seeking
rest
and
findeth
none
12
44
then
he
saith
i
will
return
into
my
house
from
whence
i
came
out
and
when
he
is
come
he
findeth
it
empty
swept
and
garnished
12
45
then
goeth
he
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
himself
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
there
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
first
even
so
shall
it
be
also
unto
this
wicked
generation
12
46
while
he
yet
talked
to
the
people
behold
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
without
desiring
to
speak
with
him
12
47
then
one
said
unto
him
behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
to
speak
with
thee
12
48
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him
who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brethren
12
49
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
disciples
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren
12
50
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
13
1
the
same
day
went
jesus
out
of
the
house
and
sat
by
the
sea
side
13
2
and
great
multitudes
were
gathered
together
unto
him
so
that
he
went
into
a
ship
and
sat
and
the
whole
multitude
stood
on
the
shore
13
3
and
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
parables
saying
behold
a
sower
went
forth
to
sow
13
4
and
when
he
sowed
some
seeds
fell
by
the
way
side
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
up
13
5
some
fell
upon
stony
places
where
they
had
not
much
earth
and
forthwith
they
sprung
up
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
earth
13
6
and
when
the
sun
was
up
they
were
scorched
and
because
they
had
no
root
they
withered
away
13
7
and
some
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
sprung
up
and
choked
them
13
8
but
other
fell
into
good
ground
and
brought
forth
fruit
some
an
hundredfold
some
sixtyfold
some
thirtyfold
13
9
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
13
10
and
the
disciples
came
and
said
unto
him
why
speakest
thou
unto
them
in
parables
13
11
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
because
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
to
them
it
is
not
given
13
12
for
whosoever
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
he
shall
have
more
abundance
but
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
he
hath
13
13
therefore
speak
i
to
them
in
parables
because
they
seeing
see
not
and
hearing
they
hear
not
neither
do
they
understand
13
14
and
in
them
is
fulfilled
the
prophecy
of
esaias
which
saith
by
hearing
ye
shall
hear
and
shall
not
understand
and
seeing
ye
shall
see
and
shall
not
perceive
13
15
for
this
people’s
heart
is
waxed
gross
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing
and
their
eyes
they
have
closed
lest
at
any
time
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
should
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
13
16
but
blessed
are
your
eyes
for
they
see
and
your
ears
for
they
hear
13
17
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see
and
have
not
seen
them
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear
and
have
not
heard
them
13
18
hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
sower
13
19
when
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
kingdom
and
understandeth
it
not
then
cometh
the
wicked
one
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
heart
this
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
side
13
20
but
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
places
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
it
13
21
yet
hath
he
not
root
in
himself
but
dureth
for
a
while
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
word
by
and
by
he
is
offended
13
22
he
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
the
care
of
this
world
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
choke
the
word
and
he
becometh
unfruitful
13
23
but
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
understandeth
it
which
also
beareth
fruit
and
bringeth
forth
some
an
hundredfold
some
sixty
some
thirty
13
24
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
man
which
sowed
good
seed
in
his
field
13
25
but
while
men
slept
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
among
the
wheat
and
went
his
way
13
26
but
when
the
blade
was
sprung
up
and
brought
forth
fruit
then
appeared
the
tares
also
13
27
so
the
servants
of
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
him
sir
didst
not
thou
sow
good
seed
in
thy
field
from
whence
then
hath
it
tares
13
28
he
said
unto
them
an
enemy
hath
done
this
the
servants
said
unto
him
wilt
thou
then
that
we
go
and
gather
them
up
13
29
but
he
said
nay
lest
while
ye
gather
up
the
tares
ye
root
up
also
the
wheat
with
them
13
30
let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest
and
in
the
time
of
harvest
i
will
say
to
the
reapers
gather
ye
together
first
the
tares
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
them
but
gather
the
wheat
into
my
barn
13
31
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
to
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
which
a
man
took
and
sowed
in
his
field
13
32
which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
seeds
but
when
it
is
grown
it
is
the
greatest
among
herbs
and
becometh
a
tree
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
thereof
13
33
another
parable
spake
he
unto
them
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
leaven
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal
till
the
whole
was
leavened
13
34
all
these
things
spake
jesus
unto
the
multitude
in
parables
and
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them
13
35
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
parables
i
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
13
36
then
jesus
sent
the
multitude
away
and
went
into
the
house
and
his
disciples
came
unto
him
saying
declare
unto
us
the
parable
of
the
tares
of
the
field
13
37
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
he
that
soweth
the
good
seed
is
the
son
of
man
13
38
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
13
39
the
enemy
that
sowed
them
is
the
devil
the
harvest
is
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
reapers
are
the
angels
13
40
as
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
in
the
fire
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
world
13
41
the
son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
offend
and
them
which
do
iniquity
13
42
and
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
fire
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
13
43
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
father
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
13
44
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
treasure
hid
in
a
field
the
which
when
a
man
hath
found
he
hideth
and
for
joy
thereof
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
he
hath
and
buyeth
that
field
13
45
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
merchant
man
seeking
goodly
pearls
13
46
who
when
he
had
found
one
pearl
of
great
price
went
and
sold
all
that
he
had
and
bought
it
13
47
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
net
that
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
gathered
of
every
kind
13
48
which
when
it
was
full
they
drew
to
shore
and
sat
down
and
gathered
the
good
into
vessels
but
cast
the
bad
away
13
49
so
shall
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
world
the
angels
shall
come
forth
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
just
13
50
and
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
of
fire
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
13
51
jesus
saith
unto
them
have
ye
understood
all
these
things
they
say
unto
him
yea
lord
13
52
then
said
he
unto
them
therefore
every
scribe
which
is
instructed
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder
which
bringeth
forth
out
of
his
treasure
things
new
and
old
13
53
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
finished
these
parables
he
departed
thence
13
54
and
when
he
was
come
into
his
own
country
he
taught
them
in
their
synagogue
insomuch
that
they
were
astonished
and
said
whence
hath
this
man
this
wisdom
and
these
mighty
works
13
55
is
not
this
the
carpenter’s
son
is
not
his
mother
called
mary
and
his
brethren
james
and
joses
and
simon
and
judas
13
56
and
his
sisters
are
they
not
all
with
us
whence
then
hath
this
man
all
these
things
13
57
and
they
were
offended
in
him
but
jesus
said
unto
them
a
prophet
is
not
without
honour
save
in
his
own
country
and
in
his
own
house
13
58
and
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
unbelief
14
1
at
that
time
herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
the
fame
of
jesus
14
2
and
said
unto
his
servants
this
is
john
the
baptist
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
him
14
3
for
herod
had
laid
hold
on
john
and
bound
him
and
put
him
in
prison
for
herodias’
sake
his
brother
philip’s
wife
14
4
for
john
said
unto
him
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
her
14
5
and
when
he
would
have
put
him
to
death
he
feared
the
multitude
because
they
counted
him
as
a
prophet
14
6
but
when
herod’s
birthday
was
kept
the
daughter
of
herodias
danced
before
them
and
pleased
herod
14
7
whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
ask
14
8
and
she
being
before
instructed
of
her
mother
said
give
me
here
john
baptist’s
head
in
a
charger
14
9
and
the
king
was
sorry
nevertheless
for
the
oath’s
sake
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
meat
he
commanded
it
to
be
given
her
14
10
and
he
sent
and
beheaded
john
in
the
prison
14
11
and
his
head
was
brought
in
a
charger
and
given
to
the
damsel
and
she
brought
it
to
her
mother
14
12
and
his
disciples
came
and
took
up
the
body
and
buried
it
and
went
and
told
jesus
14
13
when
jesus
heard
of
it
he
departed
thence
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
apart
and
when
the
people
had
heard
thereof
they
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
cities
14
14
and
jesus
went
forth
and
saw
a
great
multitude
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
them
and
he
healed
their
sick
14
15
and
when
it
was
evening
his
disciples
came
to
him
saying
this
is
a
desert
place
and
the
time
is
now
past
send
the
multitude
away
that
they
may
go
into
the
villages
and
buy
themselves
victuals
14
16
but
jesus
said
unto
them
they
need
not
depart
give
ye
them
to
eat
14
17
and
they
say
unto
him
we
have
here
but
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
14
18
he
said
bring
them
hither
to
me
14
19
and
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
the
loaves
to
his
disciples
and
the
disciples
to
the
multitude
14
20
and
they
did
all
eat
and
were
filled
and
they
took
up
of
the
fragments
that
remained
twelve
baskets
full
14
21
and
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
five
thousand
men
beside
women
and
children
14
22
and
straightway
jesus
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
a
ship
and
to
go
before
him
unto
the
other
side
while
he
sent
the
multitudes
away
14
23
and
when
he
had
sent
the
multitudes
away
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
apart
to
pray
and
when
the
evening
was
come
he
was
there
alone
14
24
but
the
ship
was
now
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
tossed
with
waves
for
the
wind
was
contrary
14
25
and
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
jesus
went
unto
them
walking
on
the
sea
14
26
and
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
on
the
sea
they
were
troubled
saying
it
is
a
spirit
and
they
cried
out
for
fear
14
27
but
straightway
jesus
spake
unto
them
saying
be
of
good
cheer
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
14
28
and
peter
answered
him
and
said
lord
if
it
be
thou
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
water
14
29
and
he
said
come
and
when
peter
was
come
down
out
of
the
ship
he
walked
on
the
water
to
go
to
jesus
14
30
but
when
he
saw
the
wind
boisterous
he
was
afraid
and
beginning
to
sink
he
cried
saying
lord
save
me
14
31
and
immediately
jesus
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
caught
him
and
said
unto
him
o
thou
of
little
faith
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
14
32
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
ship
the
wind
ceased
14
33
then
they
that
were
in
the
ship
came
and
worshipped
him
saying
of
a
truth
thou
art
the
son
of
god
14
34
and
when
they
were
gone
over
they
came
into
the
land
of
gennesaret
14
35
and
when
the
men
of
that
place
had
knowledge
of
him
they
sent
out
into
all
that
country
round
about
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
diseased
14
36
and
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
hem
of
his
garment
and
as
many
as
touched
were
made
perfectly
whole
15
1
then
came
to
jesus
scribes
and
pharisees
which
were
of
jerusalem
saying
15
2
why
do
thy
disciples
transgress
the
tradition
of
the
elders
for
they
wash
not
their
hands
when
they
eat
bread
15
3
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
why
do
ye
also
transgress
the
commandment
of
god
by
your
tradition
15
4
for
god
commanded
saying
honour
thy
father
and
mother
and
he
that
curseth
father
or
mother
let
him
die
the
death
15
5
but
ye
say
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
father
or
his
mother
it
is
a
gift
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me
15
6
and
honour
not
his
father
or
his
mother
he
shall
be
free
thus
have
ye
made
the
commandment
of
god
of
none
effect
by
your
tradition
15
7
ye
hypocrites
well
did
esaias
prophesy
of
you
saying
15
8
this
people
draweth
nigh
unto
me
with
their
mouth
and
honoureth
me
with
their
lips
but
their
heart
is
far
from
me
15
9
but
in
vain
they
do
worship
me
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men
15
10
and
he
called
the
multitude
and
said
unto
them
hear
and
understand
15
11
not
that
which
goeth
into
the
mouth
defileth
a
man
but
that
which
cometh
out
of
the
mouth
this
defileth
a
man
15
12
then
came
his
disciples
and
said
unto
him
knowest
thou
that
the
pharisees
were
offended
after
they
heard
this
saying
15
13
but
he
answered
and
said
every
plant
which
my
heavenly
father
hath
not
planted
shall
be
rooted
up
15
14
let
them
alone
they
be
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
and
if
the
blind
lead
the
blind
both
shall
fall
into
the
ditch
15
15
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
him
declare
unto
us
this
parable
15
16
and
jesus
said
are
ye
also
yet
without
understanding
15
17
do
not
ye
yet
understand
that
whatsoever
entereth
in
at
the
mouth
goeth
into
the
belly
and
is
cast
out
into
the
draught
15
18
but
those
things
which
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
come
forth
from
the
heart
and
they
defile
the
man
15
19
for
out
of
the
heart
proceed
evil
thoughts
murders
adulteries
fornications
thefts
false
witness
blasphemies
15
20
these
are
the
things
which
defile
a
man
but
to
eat
with
unwashen
hands
defileth
not
a
man
15
21
then
jesus
went
thence
and
departed
into
the
coasts
of
tyre
and
sidon
15
22
and
behold
a
woman
of
canaan
came
out
of
the
same
coasts
and
cried
unto
him
saying
have
mercy
on
me
o
lord
thou
son
of
david
my
daughter
is
grievously
vexed
with
a
devil
15
23
but
he
answered
her
not
a
word
and
his
disciples
came
and
besought
him
saying
send
her
away
for
she
crieth
after
us
15
24
but
he
answered
and
said
i
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
15
25
then
came
she
and
worshipped
him
saying
lord
help
me
15
26
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children’s
bread
and
to
cast
it
to
dogs
15
27
and
she
said
truth
lord
yet
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
masters’
table
15
28
then
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
o
woman
great
is
thy
faith
be
it
unto
thee
even
as
thou
wilt
and
her
daughter
was
made
whole
from
that
very
hour
15
29
and
jesus
departed
from
thence
and
came
nigh
unto
the
sea
of
galilee
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
and
sat
down
there
15
30
and
great
multitudes
came
unto
him
having
with
them
those
that
were
lame
blind
dumb
maimed
and
many
others
and
cast
them
down
at
jesus’
feet
and
he
healed
them
15
31
insomuch
that
the
multitude
wondered
when
they
saw
the
dumb
to
speak
the
maimed
to
be
whole
the
lame
to
walk
and
the
blind
to
see
and
they
glorified
the
god
of
israel
15
32
then
jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
him
and
said
i
have
compassion
on
the
multitude
because
they
continue
with
me
now
three
days
and
have
nothing
to
eat
and
i
will
not
send
them
away
fasting
lest
they
faint
in
the
way
15
33
and
his
disciples
say
unto
him
whence
should
we
have
so
much
bread
in
the
wilderness
as
to
fill
so
great
a
multitude
15
34
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
how
many
loaves
have
ye
and
they
said
seven
and
a
few
little
fishes
15
35
and
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
15
36
and
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fishes
and
gave
thanks
and
brake
them
and
gave
to
his
disciples
and
the
disciples
to
the
multitude
15
37
and
they
did
all
eat
and
were
filled
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
baskets
full
15
38
and
they
that
did
eat
were
four
thousand
men
beside
women
and
children
15
39
and
he
sent
away
the
multitude
and
took
ship
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
magdala
16
1
the
pharisees
also
with
the
sadducees
came
and
tempting
desired
him
that
he
would
shew
them
a
sign
from
heaven
16
2
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
when
it
is
evening
ye
say
it
will
be
fair
weather
for
the
sky
is
red
16
3
and
in
the
morning
it
will
be
foul
weather
to
day
for
the
sky
is
red
and
lowering
o
ye
hypocrites
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
16
4
a
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
it
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
jonas
and
he
left
them
and
departed
16
5
and
when
his
disciples
were
come
to
the
other
side
they
had
forgotten
to
take
bread
16
6
then
jesus
said
unto
them
take
heed
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
16
7
and
they
reasoned
among
themselves
saying
it
is
because
we
have
taken
no
bread
16
8
which
when
jesus
perceived
he
said
unto
them
o
ye
of
little
faith
why
reason
ye
among
yourselves
because
ye
have
brought
no
bread
16
9
do
ye
not
yet
understand
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
of
the
five
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up
16
10
neither
the
seven
loaves
of
the
four
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up
16
11
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
that
i
spake
it
not
to
you
concerning
bread
that
ye
should
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
16
12
then
understood
they
how
that
he
bade
them
not
beware
of
the
leaven
of
bread
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
16
13
when
jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
caesarea
philippi
he
asked
his
disciples
saying
whom
do
men
say
that
i
the
son
of
man
am
16
14
and
they
said
some
say
that
thou
art
john
the
baptist
some
elias
and
others
jeremias
or
one
of
the
prophets
16
15
he
saith
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
16
16
and
simon
peter
answered
and
said
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
16
17
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
simon
barjona
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
16
18
and
i
say
also
unto
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
16
19
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
16
20
then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
jesus
the
christ
16
21
from
that
time
forth
began
jesus
to
shew
unto
his
disciples
how
that
he
must
go
unto
jerusalem
and
suffer
many
things
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
killed
and
be
raised
again
the
third
day
16
22
then
peter
took
him
and
began
to
rebuke
him
saying
be
it
far
from
thee
lord
this
shall
not
be
unto
thee
16
23
but
he
turned
and
said
unto
peter
get
thee
behind
me
satan
thou
art
an
offence
unto
me
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
god
but
those
that
be
of
men
16
24
then
said
jesus
unto
his
disciples
if
any
man
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
16
25
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
16
26
for
what
is
a
man
profited
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
16
27
for
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
16
28
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
his
kingdom
17
1
and
after
six
days
jesus
taketh
peter
james
and
john
his
brother
and
bringeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
17
2
and
was
transfigured
before
them
and
his
face
did
shine
as
the
sun
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
light
17
3
and
behold
there
appeared
unto
them
moses
and
elias
talking
with
him
17
4
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
jesus
lord
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
if
thou
wilt
let
us
make
here
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
moses
and
one
for
elias
17
5
while
he
yet
spake
behold
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud
which
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
hear
ye
him
17
6
and
when
the
disciples
heard
it
they
fell
on
their
face
and
were
sore
afraid
17
7
and
jesus
came
and
touched
them
and
said
arise
and
be
not
afraid
17
8
and
when
they
had
lifted
up
their
eyes
they
saw
no
man
save
jesus
only
17
9
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain
jesus
charged
them
saying
tell
the
vision
to
no
man
until
the
son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
dead
17
10
and
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
why
then
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
come
17
11
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
elias
truly
shall
first
come
and
restore
all
things
17
12
but
i
say
unto
you
that
elias
is
come
already
and
they
knew
him
not
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed
likewise
shall
also
the
son
of
man
suffer
of
them
17
13
then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
john
the
baptist
17
14
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
multitude
there
came
to
him
a
certain
man
kneeling
down
to
him
and
saying
17
15
lord
have
mercy
on
my
son
for
he
is
lunatick
and
sore
vexed
for
ofttimes
he
falleth
into
the
fire
and
oft
into
the
water
17
16
and
i
brought
him
to
thy
disciples
and
they
could
not
cure
him
17
17
then
jesus
answered
and
said
o
faithless
and
perverse
generation
how
long
shall
i
be
with
you
how
long
shall
i
suffer
you
bring
him
hither
to
me
17
18
and
jesus
rebuked
the
devil
and
he
departed
out
of
him
and
the
child
was
cured
from
that
very
hour
17
19
then
came
the
disciples
to
jesus
apart
and
said
why
could
not
we
cast
him
out
17
20
and
jesus
said
unto
them
because
of
your
unbelief
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
remove
hence
to
yonder
place
and
it
shall
remove
and
nothing
shall
be
impossible
unto
you
17
21
howbeit
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
17
22
and
while
they
abode
in
galilee
jesus
said
unto
them
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
men
17
23
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
again
and
they
were
exceeding
sorry
17
24
and
when
they
were
come
to
capernaum
they
that
received
tribute
money
came
to
peter
and
said
doth
not
your
master
pay
tribute
17
25
he
saith
yes
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
jesus
prevented
him
saying
what
thinkest
thou
simon
of
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
custom
or
tribute
of
their
own
children
or
of
strangers
17
26
peter
saith
unto
him
of
strangers
jesus
saith
unto
him
then
are
the
children
free
17
27
notwithstanding
lest
we
should
offend
them
go
thou
to
the
sea
and
cast
an
hook
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
up
and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
mouth
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
money
that
take
and
give
unto
them
for
me
and
thee
18
1
at
the
same
time
came
the
disciples
unto
jesus
saying
who
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
18
2
and
jesus
called
a
little
child
unto
him
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
18
3
and
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
be
converted
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
18
4
whosoever
therefore
shall
humble
himself
as
this
little
child
the
same
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
18
5
and
whoso
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me
18
6
but
whoso
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
which
believe
in
me
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
18
7
woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offences
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
cometh
18
8
wherefore
if
thy
hand
or
thy
foot
offend
thee
cut
them
off
and
cast
them
from
thee
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
halt
or
maimed
rather
than
having
two
hands
or
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
everlasting
fire
18
9
and
if
thine
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
out
and
cast
it
from
thee
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
with
one
eye
rather
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
fire
18
10
take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
for
i
say
unto
you
that
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
18
11
for
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
lost
18
12
how
think
ye
if
a
man
have
an
hundred
sheep
and
one
of
them
be
gone
astray
doth
he
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
and
goeth
into
the
mountains
and
seeketh
that
which
is
gone
astray
18
13
and
if
so
be
that
he
find
it
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
rejoiceth
more
of
that
sheep
than
of
the
ninety
and
nine
which
went
not
astray
18
14
even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
perish
18
15
moreover
if
thy
brother
shall
trespass
against
thee
go
and
tell
him
his
fault
between
thee
and
him
alone
if
he
shall
hear
thee
thou
hast
gained
thy
brother
18
16
but
if
he
will
not
hear
thee
then
take
with
thee
one
or
two
more
that
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
word
may
be
established
18
17
and
if
he
shall
neglect
to
hear
them
tell
it
unto
the
church
but
if
he
neglect
to
hear
the
church
let
him
be
unto
thee
as
an
heathen
man
and
a
publican
18
18
verily
i
say
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
18
19
again
i
say
unto
you
that
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
any
thing
that
they
shall
ask
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
18
20
for
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
them
18
21
then
came
peter
to
him
and
said
lord
how
oft
shall
my
brother
sin
against
me
and
i
forgive
him
till
seven
times
18
22
jesus
saith
unto
him
i
say
not
unto
thee
until
seven
times
but
until
seventy
times
seven
18
23
therefore
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
likened
unto
a
certain
king
which
would
take
account
of
his
servants
18
24
and
when
he
had
begun
to
reckon
one
was
brought
unto
him
which
owed
him
ten
thousand
talents
18
25
but
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
to
pay
his
lord
commanded
him
to
be
sold
and
his
wife
and
children
and
all
that
he
had
and
payment
to
be
made
18
26
the
servant
therefore
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
saying
lord
have
patience
with
me
and
i
will
pay
thee
all
18
27
then
the
lord
of
that
servant
was
moved
with
compassion
and
loosed
him
and
forgave
him
the
debt
18
28
but
the
same
servant
went
out
and
found
one
of
his
fellowservants
which
owed
him
an
hundred
pence
and
he
laid
hands
on
him
and
took
him
by
the
throat
saying
pay
me
that
thou
owest
18
29
and
his
fellowservant
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
besought
him
saying
have
patience
with
me
and
i
will
pay
thee
all
18
30
and
he
would
not
but
went
and
cast
him
into
prison
till
he
should
pay
the
debt
18
31
so
when
his
fellowservants
saw
what
was
done
they
were
very
sorry
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
done
18
32
then
his
lord
after
that
he
had
called
him
said
unto
him
o
thou
wicked
servant
i
forgave
thee
all
that
debt
because
thou
desiredst
me
18
33
shouldest
not
thou
also
have
had
compassion
on
thy
fellowservant
even
as
i
had
pity
on
thee
18
34
and
his
lord
was
wroth
and
delivered
him
to
the
tormentors
till
he
should
pay
all
that
was
due
unto
him
18
35
so
likewise
shall
my
heavenly
father
do
also
unto
you
if
ye
from
your
hearts
forgive
not
every
one
his
brother
their
trespasses
19
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
finished
these
sayings
he
departed
from
galilee
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
judaea
beyond
jordan
19
2
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
he
healed
them
there
19
3
the
pharisees
also
came
unto
him
tempting
him
and
saying
unto
him
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
cause
19
4
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
have
ye
not
read
that
he
which
made
them
at
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
19
5
and
said
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
to
his
wife
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
flesh
19
6
wherefore
they
are
no
more
twain
but
one
flesh
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
19
7
they
say
unto
him
why
did
moses
then
command
to
give
a
writing
of
divorcement
and
to
put
her
away
19
8
he
saith
unto
them
moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
wives
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so
19
9
and
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
it
be
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
adultery
19
10
his
disciples
say
unto
him
if
the
case
of
the
man
be
so
with
his
wife
it
is
not
good
to
marry
19
11
but
he
said
unto
them
all
men
cannot
receive
this
saying
save
they
to
whom
it
is
given
19
12
for
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
so
born
from
their
mother’s
womb
and
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
men
and
there
be
eunuchs
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven’s
sake
he
that
is
able
to
receive
it
let
him
receive
it
19
13
then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
children
that
he
should
put
his
hands
on
them
and
pray
and
the
disciples
rebuked
them
19
14
but
jesus
said
suffer
little
children
and
forbid
them
not
to
come
unto
me
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
19
15
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
them
and
departed
thence
19
16
and
behold
one
came
and
said
unto
him
good
master
what
good
thing
shall
i
do
that
i
may
have
eternal
life
19
17
and
he
said
unto
him
why
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
but
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
19
18
he
saith
unto
him
which
jesus
said
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
19
19
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
19
20
the
young
man
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
up
what
lack
i
yet
19
21
jesus
said
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
be
perfect
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
and
follow
me
19
22
but
when
the
young
man
heard
that
saying
he
went
away
sorrowful
for
he
had
great
possessions
19
23
then
said
jesus
unto
his
disciples
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
a
rich
man
shall
hardly
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
19
24
and
again
i
say
unto
you
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
19
25
when
his
disciples
heard
it
they
were
exceedingly
amazed
saying
who
then
can
be
saved
19
26
but
jesus
beheld
them
and
said
unto
them
with
men
this
is
impossible
but
with
god
all
things
are
possible
19
27
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
him
behold
we
have
forsaken
all
and
followed
thee
what
shall
we
have
therefore
19
28
and
jesus
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
which
have
followed
me
in
the
regeneration
when
the
son
of
man
shall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
glory
ye
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
19
29
and
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
name’s
sake
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
19
30
but
many
that
are
first
shall
be
last
and
the
last
shall
be
first
20
1
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder
which
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
labourers
into
his
vineyard
20
2
and
when
he
had
agreed
with
the
labourers
for
a
penny
a
day
he
sent
them
into
his
vineyard
20
3
and
he
went
out
about
the
third
hour
and
saw
others
standing
idle
in
the
marketplace
20
4
and
said
unto
them
go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard
and
whatsoever
is
right
i
will
give
you
and
they
went
their
way
20
5
again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
hour
and
did
likewise
20
6
and
about
the
eleventh
hour
he
went
out
and
found
others
standing
idle
and
saith
unto
them
why
stand
ye
here
all
the
day
idle
20
7
they
say
unto
him
because
no
man
hath
hired
us
he
saith
unto
them
go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard
and
whatsoever
is
right
that
shall
ye
receive
20
8
so
when
even
was
come
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
steward
call
the
labourers
and
give
them
their
hire
beginning
from
the
last
unto
the
first
20
9
and
when
they
came
that
were
hired
about
the
eleventh
hour
they
received
every
man
a
penny
20
10
but
when
the
first
came
they
supposed
that
they
should
have
received
more
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
a
penny
20
11
and
when
they
had
received
it
they
murmured
against
the
goodman
of
the
house
20
12
saying
these
last
have
wrought
but
one
hour
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
us
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
20
13
but
he
answered
one
of
them
and
said
friend
i
do
thee
no
wrong
didst
not
thou
agree
with
me
for
a
penny
20
14
take
that
thine
is
and
go
thy
way
i
will
give
unto
this
last
even
as
unto
thee
20
15
is
it
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
what
i
will
with
mine
own
is
thine
eye
evil
because
i
am
good
20
16
so
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
last
for
many
be
called
but
few
chosen
20
17
and
jesus
going
up
to
jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
in
the
way
and
said
unto
them
20
18
behold
we
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
scribes
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
death
20
19
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
gentiles
to
mock
and
to
scourge
and
to
crucify
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again
20
20
then
came
to
him
the
mother
of
zebedee’s
children
with
her
sons
worshipping
him
and
desiring
a
certain
thing
of
him
20
21
and
he
said
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
she
saith
unto
him
grant
that
these
my
two
sons
may
sit
the
one
on
thy
right
hand
and
the
other
on
the
left
in
thy
kingdom
20
22
but
jesus
answered
and
said
ye
know
not
what
ye
ask
are
ye
able
to
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
shall
drink
of
and
to
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
with
they
say
unto
him
we
are
able
20
23
and
he
saith
unto
them
ye
shall
drink
indeed
of
my
cup
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
with
but
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
is
not
mine
to
give
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared
of
my
father
20
24
and
when
the
ten
heard
it
they
were
moved
with
indignation
against
the
two
brethren
20
25
but
jesus
called
them
unto
him
and
said
ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
them
and
they
that
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
them
20
26
but
it
shall
not
be
so
among
you
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you
let
him
be
your
minister
20
27
and
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
you
let
him
be
your
servant
20
28
even
as
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many
20
29
and
as
they
departed
from
jericho
a
great
multitude
followed
him
20
30
and
behold
two
blind
men
sitting
by
the
way
side
when
they
heard
that
jesus
passed
by
cried
out
saying
have
mercy
on
us
o
lord
thou
son
of
david
20
31
and
the
multitude
rebuked
them
because
they
should
hold
their
peace
but
they
cried
the
more
saying
have
mercy
on
us
o
lord
thou
son
of
david
20
32
and
jesus
stood
still
and
called
them
and
said
what
will
ye
that
i
shall
do
unto
you
20
33
they
say
unto
him
lord
that
our
eyes
may
be
opened
20
34
so
jesus
had
compassion
on
them
and
touched
their
eyes
and
immediately
their
eyes
received
sight
and
they
followed
him
21
1
and
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
jerusalem
and
were
come
to
bethphage
unto
the
mount
of
olives
then
sent
jesus
two
disciples
21
2
saying
unto
them
go
into
the
village
over
against
you
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
tied
and
a
colt
with
her
loose
them
and
bring
them
unto
me
21
3
and
if
any
man
say
ought
unto
you
ye
shall
say
the
lord
hath
need
of
them
and
straightway
he
will
send
them
21
4
all
this
was
done
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
21
5
tell
ye
the
daughter
of
sion
behold
thy
king
cometh
unto
thee
meek
and
sitting
upon
an
ass
and
a
colt
the
foal
of
an
ass
21
6
and
the
disciples
went
and
did
as
jesus
commanded
them
21
7
and
brought
the
ass
and
the
colt
and
put
on
them
their
clothes
and
they
set
him
thereon
21
8
and
a
very
great
multitude
spread
their
garments
in
the
way
others
cut
down
branches
from
the
trees
and
strawed
them
in
the
way
21
9
and
the
multitudes
that
went
before
and
that
followed
cried
saying
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
hosanna
in
the
highest
21
10
and
when
he
was
come
into
jerusalem
all
the
city
was
moved
saying
who
is
this
21
11
and
the
multitude
said
this
is
jesus
the
prophet
of
nazareth
of
galilee
21
12
and
jesus
went
into
the
temple
of
god
and
cast
out
all
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
doves
21
13
and
said
unto
them
it
is
written
my
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
21
14
and
the
blind
and
the
lame
came
to
him
in
the
temple
and
he
healed
them
21
15
and
when
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
saw
the
wonderful
things
that
he
did
and
the
children
crying
in
the
temple
and
saying
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
they
were
sore
displeased
21
16
and
said
unto
him
hearest
thou
what
these
say
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
yea
have
ye
never
read
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
perfected
praise
21
17
and
he
left
them
and
went
out
of
the
city
into
bethany
and
he
lodged
there
21
18
now
in
the
morning
as
he
returned
into
the
city
he
hungered
21
19
and
when
he
saw
a
fig
tree
in
the
way
he
came
to
it
and
found
nothing
thereon
but
leaves
only
and
said
unto
it
let
no
fruit
grow
on
thee
henceforward
for
ever
and
presently
the
fig
tree
withered
away
21
20
and
when
the
disciples
saw
it
they
marvelled
saying
how
soon
is
the
fig
tree
withered
away
21
21
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
faith
and
doubt
not
ye
shall
not
only
do
this
which
is
done
to
the
fig
tree
but
also
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
removed
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea
it
shall
be
done
21
22
and
all
things
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer
believing
ye
shall
receive
21
23
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
temple
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
unto
him
as
he
was
teaching
and
said
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
21
24
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
also
will
ask
you
one
thing
which
if
ye
tell
me
i
in
like
wise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
21
25
the
baptism
of
john
whence
was
it
from
heaven
or
of
men
and
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
if
we
shall
say
from
heaven
he
will
say
unto
us
why
did
ye
not
then
believe
him
21
26
but
if
we
shall
say
of
men
we
fear
the
people
for
all
hold
john
as
a
prophet
21
27
and
they
answered
jesus
and
said
we
cannot
tell
and
he
said
unto
them
neither
tell
i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
21
28
but
what
think
ye
a
certain
man
had
two
sons
and
he
came
to
the
first
and
said
son
go
work
to
day
in
my
vineyard
21
29
he
answered
and
said
i
will
not
but
afterward
he
repented
and
went
21
30
and
he
came
to
the
second
and
said
likewise
and
he
answered
and
said
i
go
sir
and
went
not
21
31
whether
of
them
twain
did
the
will
of
his
father
they
say
unto
him
the
first
jesus
saith
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
god
before
you
21
32
for
john
came
unto
you
in
the
way
of
righteousness
and
ye
believed
him
not
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
him
and
ye
when
ye
had
seen
it
repented
not
afterward
that
ye
might
believe
him
21
33
hear
another
parable
there
was
a
certain
householder
which
planted
a
vineyard
and
hedged
it
round
about
and
digged
a
winepress
in
it
and
built
a
tower
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen
and
went
into
a
far
country
21
34
and
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
near
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
husbandmen
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
it
21
35
and
the
husbandmen
took
his
servants
and
beat
one
and
killed
another
and
stoned
another
21
36
again
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
first
and
they
did
unto
them
likewise
21
37
but
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
son
saying
they
will
reverence
my
son
21
38
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
son
they
said
among
themselves
this
is
the
heir
come
let
us
kill
him
and
let
us
seize
on
his
inheritance
21
39
and
they
caught
him
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
slew
him
21
40
when
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
cometh
what
will
he
do
unto
those
husbandmen
21
41
they
say
unto
him
he
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
men
and
will
let
out
his
vineyard
unto
other
husbandmen
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
seasons
21
42
jesus
saith
unto
them
did
ye
never
read
in
the
scriptures
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
this
is
the
lord’s
doing
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes
21
43
therefore
say
i
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
from
you
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
thereof
21
44
and
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
broken
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
21
45
and
when
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
had
heard
his
parables
they
perceived
that
he
spake
of
them
21
46
but
when
they
sought
to
lay
hands
on
him
they
feared
the
multitude
because
they
took
him
for
a
prophet
22
1
and
jesus
answered
and
spake
unto
them
again
by
parables
and
said
22
2
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
king
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
son
22
3
and
sent
forth
his
servants
to
call
them
that
were
bidden
to
the
wedding
and
they
would
not
come
22
4
again
he
sent
forth
other
servants
saying
tell
them
which
are
bidden
behold
i
have
prepared
my
dinner
my
oxen
and
my
fatlings
are
killed
and
all
things
are
ready
come
unto
the
marriage
22
5
but
they
made
light
of
it
and
went
their
ways
one
to
his
farm
another
to
his
merchandise
22
6
and
the
remnant
took
his
servants
and
entreated
them
spitefully
and
slew
them
22
7
but
when
the
king
heard
thereof
he
was
wroth
and
he
sent
forth
his
armies
and
destroyed
those
murderers
and
burned
up
their
city
22
8
then
saith
he
to
his
servants
the
wedding
is
ready
but
they
which
were
bidden
were
not
worthy
22
9
go
ye
therefore
into
the
highways
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
find
bid
to
the
marriage
22
10
so
those
servants
went
out
into
the
highways
and
gathered
together
all
as
many
as
they
found
both
bad
and
good
and
the
wedding
was
furnished
with
guests
22
11
and
when
the
king
came
in
to
see
the
guests
he
saw
there
a
man
which
had
not
on
a
wedding
garment
22
12
and
he
saith
unto
him
friend
how
camest
thou
in
hither
not
having
a
wedding
garment
and
he
was
speechless
22
13
then
said
the
king
to
the
servants
bind
him
hand
and
foot
and
take
him
away
and
cast
him
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
22
14
for
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
22
15
then
went
the
pharisees
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
entangle
him
in
his
talk
22
16
and
they
sent
out
unto
him
their
disciples
with
the
herodians
saying
master
we
know
that
thou
art
true
and
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
truth
neither
carest
thou
for
any
man
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men
22
17
tell
us
therefore
what
thinkest
thou
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
caesar
or
not
22
18
but
jesus
perceived
their
wickedness
and
said
why
tempt
ye
me
ye
hypocrites
22
19
shew
me
the
tribute
money
and
they
brought
unto
him
a
penny
22
20
and
he
saith
unto
them
whose
is
this
image
and
superscription
22
21
they
say
unto
him
caesar’s
then
saith
he
unto
them
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
caesar’s
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god’s
22
22
when
they
had
heard
these
words
they
marvelled
and
left
him
and
went
their
way
22
23
the
same
day
came
to
him
the
sadducees
which
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection
and
asked
him
22
24
saying
master
moses
said
if
a
man
die
having
no
children
his
brother
shall
marry
his
wife
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother
22
25
now
there
were
with
us
seven
brethren
and
the
first
when
he
had
married
a
wife
deceased
and
having
no
issue
left
his
wife
unto
his
brother
22
26
likewise
the
second
also
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
22
27
and
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also
22
28
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
seven
for
they
all
had
her
22
29
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
of
god
22
30
for
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
22
31
but
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
god
saying
22
32
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
22
33
and
when
the
multitude
heard
this
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
22
34
but
when
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
he
had
put
the
sadducees
to
silence
they
were
gathered
together
22
35
then
one
of
them
which
was
a
lawyer
asked
him
a
question
tempting
him
and
saying
22
36
master
which
is
the
great
commandment
in
the
law
22
37
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
22
38
this
is
the
first
and
great
commandment
22
39
and
the
second
is
like
unto
it
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
22
40
on
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
22
41
while
the
pharisees
were
gathered
together
jesus
asked
them
22
42
saying
what
think
ye
of
christ
whose
son
is
he
they
say
unto
him
the
son
of
david
22
43
he
saith
unto
them
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
lord
saying
22
44
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
22
45
if
david
then
call
him
lord
how
is
he
his
son
22
46
and
no
man
was
able
to
answer
him
a
word
neither
durst
any
man
from
that
day
forth
ask
him
any
more
questions
23
1
then
spake
jesus
to
the
multitude
and
to
his
disciples
23
2
saying
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
sit
in
moses’
seat
23
3
all
therefore
whatsoever
they
bid
you
observe
that
observe
and
do
but
do
not
ye
after
their
works
for
they
say
and
do
not
23
4
for
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
men’s
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
23
5
but
all
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
men
they
make
broad
their
phylacteries
and
enlarge
the
borders
of
their
garments
23
6
and
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues
23
7
and
greetings
in
the
markets
and
to
be
called
of
men
rabbi
rabbi
23
8
but
be
not
ye
called
rabbi
for
one
is
your
master
even
christ
and
all
ye
are
brethren
23
9
and
call
no
man
your
father
upon
the
earth
for
one
is
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
23
10
neither
be
ye
called
masters
for
one
is
your
master
even
christ
23
11
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
shall
be
your
servant
23
12
and
whosoever
shall
exalt
himself
shall
be
abased
and
he
that
shall
humble
himself
shall
be
exalted
23
13
but
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
for
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in
23
14
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
devour
widows’
houses
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayer
therefore
ye
shall
receive
the
greater
damnation
23
15
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
compass
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte
and
when
he
is
made
ye
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
yourselves
23
16
woe
unto
you
ye
blind
guides
which
say
whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
temple
it
is
nothing
but
whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
gold
of
the
temple
he
is
a
debtor
23
17
ye
fools
and
blind
for
whether
is
greater
the
gold
or
the
temple
that
sanctifieth
the
gold
23
18
and
whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
altar
it
is
nothing
but
whosoever
sweareth
by
the
gift
that
is
upon
it
he
is
guilty
23
19
ye
fools
and
blind
for
whether
is
greater
the
gift
or
the
altar
that
sanctifieth
the
gift
23
20
whoso
therefore
shall
swear
by
the
altar
sweareth
by
it
and
by
all
things
thereon
23
21
and
whoso
shall
swear
by
the
temple
sweareth
by
it
and
by
him
that
dwelleth
therein
23
22
and
he
that
shall
swear
by
heaven
sweareth
by
the
throne
of
god
and
by
him
that
sitteth
thereon
23
23
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
faith
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
23
24
ye
blind
guides
which
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
23
25
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
platter
but
within
they
are
full
of
extortion
and
excess
23
26
thou
blind
pharisee
cleanse
first
that
which
is
within
the
cup
and
platter
that
the
outside
of
them
may
be
clean
also
23
27
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
which
indeed
appear
beautiful
outward
but
are
within
full
of
dead
men’s
bones
and
of
all
uncleanness
23
28
even
so
ye
also
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
men
but
within
ye
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
iniquity
23
29
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
because
ye
build
the
tombs
of
the
prophets
and
garnish
the
sepulchres
of
the
righteous
23
30
and
say
if
we
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
we
would
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
in
the
blood
of
the
prophets
23
31
wherefore
ye
be
witnesses
unto
yourselves
that
ye
are
the
children
of
them
which
killed
the
prophets
23
32
fill
ye
up
then
the
measure
of
your
fathers
23
33
ye
serpents
ye
generation
of
vipers
how
can
ye
escape
the
damnation
of
hell
23
34
wherefore
behold
i
send
unto
you
prophets
and
wise
men
and
scribes
and
some
of
them
ye
shall
kill
and
crucify
and
some
of
them
shall
ye
scourge
in
your
synagogues
and
persecute
them
from
city
to
city
23
35
that
upon
you
may
come
all
the
righteous
blood
shed
upon
the
earth
from
the
blood
of
righteous
abel
unto
the
blood
of
zacharias
son
of
barachias
whom
ye
slew
between
the
temple
and
the
altar
23
36
verily
i
say
unto
you
all
these
things
shall
come
upon
this
generation
23
37
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
thou
that
killest
the
prophets
and
stonest
them
which
are
sent
unto
thee
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
23
38
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
23
39
for
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
see
me
henceforth
till
ye
shall
say
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
24
1
and
jesus
went
out
and
departed
from
the
temple
and
his
disciples
came
to
him
for
to
shew
him
the
buildings
of
the
temple
24
2
and
jesus
said
unto
them
see
ye
not
all
these
things
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
shall
not
be
left
here
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down
24
3
and
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
olives
the
disciples
came
unto
him
privately
saying
tell
us
when
shall
these
things
be
and
what
shall
be
the
sign
of
thy
coming
and
of
the
end
of
the
world
24
4
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
take
heed
that
no
man
deceive
you
24
5
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name
saying
i
am
christ
and
shall
deceive
many
24
6
and
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
see
that
ye
be
not
troubled
for
all
these
things
must
come
to
pass
but
the
end
is
not
yet
24
7
for
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
pestilences
and
earthquakes
in
divers
places
24
8
all
these
are
the
beginning
of
sorrows
24
9
then
shall
they
deliver
you
up
to
be
afflicted
and
shall
kill
you
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
nations
for
my
name’s
sake
24
10
and
then
shall
many
be
offended
and
shall
betray
one
another
and
shall
hate
one
another
24
11
and
many
false
prophets
shall
rise
and
shall
deceive
many
24
12
and
because
iniquity
shall
abound
the
love
of
many
shall
wax
cold
24
13
but
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved
24
14
and
this
gospel
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
preached
in
all
the
world
for
a
witness
unto
all
nations
and
then
shall
the
end
come
24
15
when
ye
therefore
shall
see
the
abomination
of
desolation
spoken
of
by
daniel
the
prophet
stand
in
the
holy
place
(whoso
readeth
let
him
understand
)
24
16
then
let
them
which
be
in
judaea
flee
into
the
mountains
24
17
let
him
which
is
on
the
housetop
not
come
down
to
take
any
thing
out
of
his
house
24
18
neither
let
him
which
is
in
the
field
return
back
to
take
his
clothes
24
19
and
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days
24
20
but
pray
ye
that
your
flight
be
not
in
the
winter
neither
on
the
sabbath
day
24
21
for
then
shall
be
great
tribulation
such
as
was
not
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
this
time
no
nor
ever
shall
be
24
22
and
except
those
days
should
be
shortened
there
should
no
flesh
be
saved
but
for
the
elect’s
sake
those
days
shall
be
shortened
24
23
then
if
any
man
shall
say
unto
you
lo
here
is
christ
or
there
believe
it
not
24
24
for
there
shall
arise
false
christs
and
false
prophets
and
shall
shew
great
signs
and
wonders
insomuch
that
if
it
were
possible
they
shall
deceive
the
very
elect
24
25
behold
i
have
told
you
before
24
26
wherefore
if
they
shall
say
unto
you
behold
he
is
in
the
desert
go
not
forth
behold
he
is
in
the
secret
chambers
believe
it
not
24
27
for
as
the
lightning
cometh
out
of
the
east
and
shineth
even
unto
the
west
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
be
24
28
for
wheresoever
the
carcase
is
there
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together
24
29
immediately
after
the
tribulation
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
shall
be
shaken
24
30
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
heaven
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
24
31
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
they
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds
from
one
end
of
heaven
to
the
other
24
32
now
learn
a
parable
of
the
fig
tree
when
his
branch
is
yet
tender
and
putteth
forth
leaves
ye
know
that
summer
is
nigh
24
33
so
likewise
ye
when
ye
shall
see
all
these
things
know
that
it
is
near
even
at
the
doors
24
34
verily
i
say
unto
you
this
generation
shall
not
pass
till
all
these
things
be
fulfilled
24
35
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away
24
36
but
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man
no
not
the
angels
of
heaven
but
my
father
only
24
37
but
as
the
days
of
noe
were
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
be
24
38
for
as
in
the
days
that
were
before
the
flood
they
were
eating
and
drinking
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
until
the
day
that
noe
entered
into
the
ark
24
39
and
knew
not
until
the
flood
came
and
took
them
all
away
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
be
24
40
then
shall
two
be
in
the
field
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
24
41
two
women
shall
be
grinding
at
the
mill
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
24
42
watch
therefore
for
ye
know
not
what
hour
your
lord
doth
come
24
43
but
know
this
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
in
what
watch
the
thief
would
come
he
would
have
watched
and
would
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
up
24
44
therefore
be
ye
also
ready
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
son
of
man
cometh
24
45
who
then
is
a
faithful
and
wise
servant
whom
his
lord
hath
made
ruler
over
his
household
to
give
them
meat
in
due
season
24
46
blessed
is
that
servant
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
doing
24
47
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
he
shall
make
him
ruler
over
all
his
goods
24
48
but
and
if
that
evil
servant
shall
say
in
his
heart
my
lord
delayeth
his
coming
24
49
and
shall
begin
to
smite
his
fellowservants
and
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
drunken
24
50
the
lord
of
that
servant
shall
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
him
and
in
an
hour
that
he
is
not
aware
of
24
51
and
shall
cut
him
asunder
and
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
hypocrites
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
25
1
then
shall
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
likened
unto
ten
virgins
which
took
their
lamps
and
went
forth
to
meet
the
bridegroom
25
2
and
five
of
them
were
wise
and
five
were
foolish
25
3
they
that
were
foolish
took
their
lamps
and
took
no
oil
with
them
25
4
but
the
wise
took
oil
in
their
vessels
with
their
lamps
25
5
while
the
bridegroom
tarried
they
all
slumbered
and
slept
25
6
and
at
midnight
there
was
a
cry
made
behold
the
bridegroom
cometh
go
ye
out
to
meet
him
25
7
then
all
those
virgins
arose
and
trimmed
their
lamps
25
8
and
the
foolish
said
unto
the
wise
give
us
of
your
oil
for
our
lamps
are
gone
out
25
9
but
the
wise
answered
saying
not
so
lest
there
be
not
enough
for
us
and
you
but
go
ye
rather
to
them
that
sell
and
buy
for
yourselves
25
10
and
while
they
went
to
buy
the
bridegroom
came
and
they
that
were
ready
went
in
with
him
to
the
marriage
and
the
door
was
shut
25
11
afterward
came
also
the
other
virgins
saying
lord
lord
open
to
us
25
12
but
he
answered
and
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
know
you
not
25
13
watch
therefore
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
wherein
the
son
of
man
cometh
25
14
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
as
a
man
travelling
into
a
far
country
who
called
his
own
servants
and
delivered
unto
them
his
goods
25
15
and
unto
one
he
gave
five
talents
to
another
two
and
to
another
one
to
every
man
according
to
his
several
ability
and
straightway
took
his
journey
25
16
then
he
that
had
received
the
five
talents
went
and
traded
with
the
same
and
made
them
other
five
talents
25
17
and
likewise
he
that
had
received
two
he
also
gained
other
two
25
18
but
he
that
had
received
one
went
and
digged
in
the
earth
and
hid
his
lord’s
money
25
19
after
a
long
time
the
lord
of
those
servants
cometh
and
reckoneth
with
them
25
20
and
so
he
that
had
received
five
talents
came
and
brought
other
five
talents
saying
lord
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
five
talents
behold
i
have
gained
beside
them
five
talents
more
25
21
his
lord
said
unto
him
well
done
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
things
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord
25
22
he
also
that
had
received
two
talents
came
and
said
lord
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
two
talents
behold
i
have
gained
two
other
talents
beside
them
25
23
his
lord
said
unto
him
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
things
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord
25
24
then
he
which
had
received
the
one
talent
came
and
said
lord
i
knew
thee
that
thou
art
an
hard
man
reaping
where
thou
hast
not
sown
and
gathering
where
thou
hast
not
strawed
25
25
and
i
was
afraid
and
went
and
hid
thy
talent
in
the
earth
lo
there
thou
hast
that
is
thine
25
26
his
lord
answered
and
said
unto
him
thou
wicked
and
slothful
servant
thou
knewest
that
i
reap
where
i
sowed
not
and
gather
where
i
have
not
strawed
25
27
thou
oughtest
therefore
to
have
put
my
money
to
the
exchangers
and
then
at
my
coming
i
should
have
received
mine
own
with
usury
25
28
take
therefore
the
talent
from
him
and
give
it
unto
him
which
hath
ten
talents
25
29
for
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
be
given
and
he
shall
have
abundance
but
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
which
he
hath
25
30
and
cast
ye
the
unprofitable
servant
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
25
31
when
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory
and
all
the
holy
angels
with
him
then
shall
he
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
glory
25
32
and
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
nations
and
he
shall
separate
them
one
from
another
as
a
shepherd
divideth
his
sheep
from
the
goats
25
33
and
he
shall
set
the
sheep
on
his
right
hand
but
the
goats
on
the
left
25
34
then
shall
the
king
say
unto
them
on
his
right
hand
come
ye
blessed
of
my
father
inherit
the
kingdom
prepared
for
you
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
25
35
for
i
was
an
hungred
and
ye
gave
me
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
ye
gave
me
drink
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
25
36
naked
and
ye
clothed
me
i
was
sick
and
ye
visited
me
i
was
in
prison
and
ye
came
unto
me
25
37
then
shall
the
righteous
answer
him
saying
lord
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred
and
fed
thee
or
thirsty
and
gave
thee
drink
25
38
when
saw
we
thee
a
stranger
and
took
thee
in
or
naked
and
clothed
thee
25
39
or
when
saw
we
thee
sick
or
in
prison
and
came
unto
thee
25
40
and
the
king
shall
answer
and
say
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
25
41
then
shall
he
say
also
unto
them
on
the
left
hand
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
25
42
for
i
was
an
hungred
and
ye
gave
me
no
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
ye
gave
me
no
drink
25
43
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
not
in
naked
and
ye
clothed
me
not
sick
and
in
prison
and
ye
visited
me
not
25
44
then
shall
they
also
answer
him
saying
lord
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred
or
athirst
or
a
stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
in
prison
and
did
not
minister
unto
thee
25
45
then
shall
he
answer
them
saying
verily
i
say
unto
you
inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
did
it
not
to
me
25
46
and
these
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
punishment
but
the
righteous
into
life
eternal
26
1
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
finished
all
these
sayings
he
said
unto
his
disciples
26
2
ye
know
that
after
two
days
is
the
feast
of
the
passover
and
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
to
be
crucified
26
3
then
assembled
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
of
the
people
unto
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
who
was
called
caiaphas
26
4
and
consulted
that
they
might
take
jesus
by
subtilty
and
kill
him
26
5
but
they
said
not
on
the
feast
day
lest
there
be
an
uproar
among
the
people
26
6
now
when
jesus
was
in
bethany
in
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
26
7
there
came
unto
him
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
very
precious
ointment
and
poured
it
on
his
head
as
he
sat
at
meat
26
8
but
when
his
disciples
saw
it
they
had
indignation
saying
to
what
purpose
is
this
waste
26
9
for
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
much
and
given
to
the
poor
26
10
when
jesus
understood
it
he
said
unto
them
why
trouble
ye
the
woman
for
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
upon
me
26
11
for
ye
have
the
poor
always
with
you
but
me
ye
have
not
always
26
12
for
in
that
she
hath
poured
this
ointment
on
my
body
she
did
it
for
my
burial
26
13
verily
i
say
unto
you
wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
world
there
shall
also
this
that
this
woman
hath
done
be
told
for
a
memorial
of
her
26
14
then
one
of
the
twelve
called
judas
iscariot
went
unto
the
chief
priests
26
15
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
give
me
and
i
will
deliver
him
unto
you
and
they
covenanted
with
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
26
16
and
from
that
time
he
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
26
17
now
the
first
day
of
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
to
jesus
saying
unto
him
where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare
for
thee
to
eat
the
passover
26
18
and
he
said
go
into
the
city
to
such
a
man
and
say
unto
him
the
master
saith
my
time
is
at
hand
i
will
keep
the
passover
at
thy
house
with
my
disciples
26
19
and
the
disciples
did
as
jesus
had
appointed
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
26
20
now
when
the
even
was
come
he
sat
down
with
the
twelve
26
21
and
as
they
did
eat
he
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
me
26
22
and
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful
and
began
every
one
of
them
to
say
unto
him
lord
is
it
i
26
23
and
he
answered
and
said
he
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
dish
the
same
shall
betray
me
26
24
the
son
of
man
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
him
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
it
had
been
good
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
born
26
25
then
judas
which
betrayed
him
answered
and
said
master
is
it
i
he
said
unto
him
thou
hast
said
26
26
and
as
they
were
eating
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
it
and
gave
it
to
the
disciples
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
26
27
and
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
it
26
28
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
26
29
but
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
this
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
i
drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
father’s
kingdom
26
30
and
when
they
had
sung
an
hymn
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
olives
26
31
then
saith
jesus
unto
them
all
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night
for
it
is
written
i
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
scattered
abroad
26
32
but
after
i
am
risen
again
i
will
go
before
you
into
galilee
26
33
peter
answered
and
said
unto
him
though
all
men
shall
be
offended
because
of
thee
yet
will
i
never
be
offended
26
34
jesus
said
unto
him
verily
i
say
unto
thee
that
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
26
35
peter
said
unto
him
though
i
should
die
with
thee
yet
will
i
not
deny
thee
likewise
also
said
all
the
disciples
26
36
then
cometh
jesus
with
them
unto
a
place
called
gethsemane
and
saith
unto
the
disciples
sit
ye
here
while
i
go
and
pray
yonder
26
37
and
he
took
with
him
peter
and
the
two
sons
of
zebedee
and
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
very
heavy
26
38
then
saith
he
unto
them
my
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful
even
unto
death
tarry
ye
here
and
watch
with
me
26
39
and
he
went
a
little
farther
and
fell
on
his
face
and
prayed
saying
o
my
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
nevertheless
not
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
26
40
and
he
cometh
unto
the
disciples
and
findeth
them
asleep
and
saith
unto
peter
what
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
26
41
watch
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
the
spirit
indeed
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak
26
42
he
went
away
again
the
second
time
and
prayed
saying
o
my
father
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
me
except
i
drink
it
thy
will
be
done
26
43
and
he
came
and
found
them
asleep
again
for
their
eyes
were
heavy
26
44
and
he
left
them
and
went
away
again
and
prayed
the
third
time
saying
the
same
words
26
45
then
cometh
he
to
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
sleep
on
now
and
take
your
rest
behold
the
hour
is
at
hand
and
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners
26
46
rise
let
us
be
going
behold
he
is
at
hand
that
doth
betray
me
26
47
and
while
he
yet
spake
lo
judas
one
of
the
twelve
came
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves
from
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people
26
48
now
he
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
a
sign
saying
whomsoever
i
shall
kiss
that
same
is
he
hold
him
fast
26
49
and
forthwith
he
came
to
jesus
and
said
hail
master
and
kissed
him
26
50
and
jesus
said
unto
him
friend
wherefore
art
thou
come
then
came
they
and
laid
hands
on
jesus
and
took
him
26
51
and
behold
one
of
them
which
were
with
jesus
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
his
sword
and
struck
a
servant
of
the
high
priest’s
and
smote
off
his
ear
26
52
then
said
jesus
unto
him
put
up
again
thy
sword
into
his
place
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
26
53
thinkest
thou
that
i
cannot
now
pray
to
my
father
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
26
54
but
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
thus
it
must
be
26
55
in
that
same
hour
said
jesus
to
the
multitudes
are
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
staves
for
to
take
me
i
sat
daily
with
you
teaching
in
the
temple
and
ye
laid
no
hold
on
me
26
56
but
all
this
was
done
that
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets
might
be
fulfilled
then
all
the
disciples
forsook
him
and
fled
26
57
and
they
that
had
laid
hold
on
jesus
led
him
away
to
caiaphas
the
high
priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were
assembled
26
58
but
peter
followed
him
afar
off
unto
the
high
priest’s
palace
and
went
in
and
sat
with
the
servants
to
see
the
end
26
59
now
the
chief
priests
and
elders
and
all
the
council
sought
false
witness
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
death
26
60
but
found
none
yea
though
many
false
witnesses
came
yet
found
they
none
at
the
last
came
two
false
witnesses
26
61
and
said
this
fellow
said
i
am
able
to
destroy
the
temple
of
god
and
to
build
it
in
three
days
26
62
and
the
high
priest
arose
and
said
unto
him
answerest
thou
nothing
what
is
it
which
these
witness
against
thee
26
63
but
jesus
held
his
peace
and
the
high
priest
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
that
thou
tell
us
whether
thou
be
the
christ
the
son
of
god
26
64
jesus
saith
unto
him
thou
hast
said
nevertheless
i
say
unto
you
hereafter
shall
ye
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
26
65
then
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes
saying
he
hath
spoken
blasphemy
what
further
need
have
we
of
witnesses
behold
now
ye
have
heard
his
blasphemy
26
66
what
think
ye
they
answered
and
said
he
is
guilty
of
death
26
67
then
did
they
spit
in
his
face
and
buffeted
him
and
others
smote
him
with
the
palms
of
their
hands
26
68
saying
prophesy
unto
us
thou
christ
who
is
he
that
smote
thee
26
69
now
peter
sat
without
in
the
palace
and
a
damsel
came
unto
him
saying
thou
also
wast
with
jesus
of
galilee
26
70
but
he
denied
before
them
all
saying
i
know
not
what
thou
sayest
26
71
and
when
he
was
gone
out
into
the
porch
another
maid
saw
him
and
said
unto
them
that
were
there
this
fellow
was
also
with
jesus
of
nazareth
26
72
and
again
he
denied
with
an
oath
i
do
not
know
the
man
26
73
and
after
a
while
came
unto
him
they
that
stood
by
and
said
to
peter
surely
thou
also
art
one
of
them
for
thy
speech
bewrayeth
thee
26
74
then
began
he
to
curse
and
to
swear
saying
i
know
not
the
man
and
immediately
the
cock
crew
26
75
and
peter
remembered
the
word
of
jesus
which
said
unto
him
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
and
he
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
27
1
when
the
morning
was
come
all
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people
took
counsel
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
death
27
2
and
when
they
had
bound
him
they
led
him
away
and
delivered
him
to
pontius
pilate
the
governor
27
3
then
judas
which
had
betrayed
him
when
he
saw
that
he
was
condemned
repented
himself
and
brought
again
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders
27
4
saying
i
have
sinned
in
that
i
have
betrayed
the
innocent
blood
and
they
said
what
is
that
to
us
see
thou
to
that
27
5
and
he
cast
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
27
6
and
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
for
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
it
is
the
price
of
blood
27
7
and
they
took
counsel
and
bought
with
them
the
potter’s
field
to
bury
strangers
in
27
8
wherefore
that
field
was
called
the
field
of
blood
unto
this
day
27
9
then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
jeremy
the
prophet
saying
and
they
took
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
the
price
of
him
that
was
valued
whom
they
of
the
children
of
israel
did
value
27
10
and
gave
them
for
the
potter’s
field
as
the
lord
appointed
me
27
11
and
jesus
stood
before
the
governor
and
the
governor
asked
him
saying
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
and
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
sayest
27
12
and
when
he
was
accused
of
the
chief
priests
and
elders
he
answered
nothing
27
13
then
said
pilate
unto
him
hearest
thou
not
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee
27
14
and
he
answered
him
to
never
a
word
insomuch
that
the
governor
marvelled
greatly
27
15
now
at
that
feast
the
governor
was
wont
to
release
unto
the
people
a
prisoner
whom
they
would
27
16
and
they
had
then
a
notable
prisoner
called
barabbas
27
17
therefore
when
they
were
gathered
together
pilate
said
unto
them
whom
will
ye
that
i
release
unto
you
barabbas
or
jesus
which
is
called
christ
27
18
for
he
knew
that
for
envy
they
had
delivered
him
27
19
when
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat
his
wife
sent
unto
him
saying
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
27
20
but
the
chief
priests
and
elders
persuaded
the
multitude
that
they
should
ask
barabbas
and
destroy
jesus
27
21
the
governor
answered
and
said
unto
them
whether
of
the
twain
will
ye
that
i
release
unto
you
they
said
barabbas
27
22
pilate
saith
unto
them
what
shall
i
do
then
with
jesus
which
is
called
christ
they
all
say
unto
him
let
him
be
crucified
27
23
and
the
governor
said
why
what
evil
hath
he
done
but
they
cried
out
the
more
saying
let
him
be
crucified
27
24
when
pilate
saw
that
he
could
prevail
nothing
but
that
rather
a
tumult
was
made
he
took
water
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
multitude
saying
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
see
ye
to
it
27
25
then
answered
all
the
people
and
said
his
blood
be
on
us
and
on
our
children
27
26
then
released
he
barabbas
unto
them
and
when
he
had
scourged
jesus
he
delivered
him
to
be
crucified
27
27
then
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
took
jesus
into
the
common
hall
and
gathered
unto
him
the
whole
band
of
soldiers
27
28
and
they
stripped
him
and
put
on
him
a
scarlet
robe
27
29
and
when
they
had
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
they
put
it
upon
his
head
and
a
reed
in
his
right
hand
and
they
bowed
the
knee
before
him
and
mocked
him
saying
hail
king
of
the
jews
27
30
and
they
spit
upon
him
and
took
the
reed
and
smote
him
on
the
head
27
31
and
after
that
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
the
robe
off
from
him
and
put
his
own
raiment
on
him
and
led
him
away
to
crucify
him
27
32
and
as
they
came
out
they
found
a
man
of
cyrene
simon
by
name
him
they
compelled
to
bear
his
cross
27
33
and
when
they
were
come
unto
a
place
called
golgotha
that
is
to
say
a
place
of
a
skull
27
34
they
gave
him
vinegar
to
drink
mingled
with
gall
and
when
he
had
tasted
thereof
he
would
not
drink
27
35
and
they
crucified
him
and
parted
his
garments
casting
lots
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
they
parted
my
garments
among
them
and
upon
my
vesture
did
they
cast
lots
27
36
and
sitting
down
they
watched
him
there
27
37
and
set
up
over
his
head
his
accusation
written
this
is
jesus
the
king
of
the
jews
27
38
then
were
there
two
thieves
crucified
with
him
one
on
the
right
hand
and
another
on
the
left
27
39
and
they
that
passed
by
reviled
him
wagging
their
heads
27
40
and
saying
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
and
buildest
it
in
three
days
save
thyself
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
come
down
from
the
cross
27
41
likewise
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
27
42
he
saved
others
himself
he
cannot
save
if
he
be
the
king
of
israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
him
27
43
he
trusted
in
god
let
him
deliver
him
now
if
he
will
have
him
for
he
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
27
44
the
thieves
also
which
were
crucified
with
him
cast
the
same
in
his
teeth
27
45
now
from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
land
unto
the
ninth
hour
27
46
and
about
the
ninth
hour
jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
eli
eli
lama
sabachthani
that
is
to
say
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
27
47
some
of
them
that
stood
there
when
they
heard
that
said
this
man
calleth
for
elias
27
48
and
straightway
one
of
them
ran
and
took
a
spunge
and
filled
it
with
vinegar
and
put
it
on
a
reed
and
gave
him
to
drink
27
49
the
rest
said
let
be
let
us
see
whether
elias
will
come
to
save
him
27
50
jesus
when
he
had
cried
again
with
a
loud
voice
yielded
up
the
ghost
27
51
and
behold
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
and
the
earth
did
quake
and
the
rocks
rent
27
52
and
the
graves
were
opened
and
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
arose
27
53
and
came
out
of
the
graves
after
his
resurrection
and
went
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
unto
many
27
54
now
when
the
centurion
and
they
that
were
with
him
watching
jesus
saw
the
earthquake
and
those
things
that
were
done
they
feared
greatly
saying
truly
this
was
the
son
of
god
27
55
and
many
women
were
there
beholding
afar
off
which
followed
jesus
from
galilee
ministering
unto
him
27
56
among
which
was
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
joses
and
the
mother
of
zebedee’s
children
27
57
when
the
even
was
come
there
came
a
rich
man
of
arimathaea
named
joseph
who
also
himself
was
jesus’
disciple
27
58
he
went
to
pilate
and
begged
the
body
of
jesus
then
pilate
commanded
the
body
to
be
delivered
27
59
and
when
joseph
had
taken
the
body
he
wrapped
it
in
a
clean
linen
cloth
27
60
and
laid
it
in
his
own
new
tomb
which
he
had
hewn
out
in
the
rock
and
he
rolled
a
great
stone
to
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
departed
27
61
and
there
was
mary
magdalene
and
the
other
mary
sitting
over
against
the
sepulchre
27
62
now
the
next
day
that
followed
the
day
of
the
preparation
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
came
together
unto
pilate
27
63
saying
sir
we
remember
that
that
deceiver
said
while
he
was
yet
alive
after
three
days
i
will
rise
again
27
64
command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
be
made
sure
until
the
third
day
lest
his
disciples
come
by
night
and
steal
him
away
and
say
unto
the
people
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
first
27
65
pilate
said
unto
them
ye
have
a
watch
go
your
way
make
it
as
sure
as
ye
can
27
66
so
they
went
and
made
the
sepulchre
sure
sealing
the
stone
and
setting
a
watch
28
1
in
the
end
of
the
sabbath
as
it
began
to
dawn
toward
the
first
day
of
the
week
came
mary
magdalene
and
the
other
mary
to
see
the
sepulchre
28
2
and
behold
there
was
a
great
earthquake
for
the
angel
of
the
lord
descended
from
heaven
and
came
and
rolled
back
the
stone
from
the
door
and
sat
upon
it
28
3
his
countenance
was
like
lightning
and
his
raiment
white
as
snow

4
and
for
fear
of
him
the
keepers
did
shake
and
became
as
dead
men
28
5
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
women
fear
not
ye
for
i
know
that
ye
seek
jesus
which
was
crucified
28
6
he
is
not
here
for
he
is
risen
as
he
said
come
see
the
place
where
the
lord
lay
28
7
and
go
quickly
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
and
behold
he
goeth
before
you
into
galilee
there
shall
ye
see
him
lo
i
have
told
you
28
8
and
they
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
joy
and
did
run
to
bring
his
disciples
word
28
9
and
as
they
went
to
tell
his
disciples
behold
jesus
met
them
saying
all
hail
and
they
came
and
held
him
by
the
feet
and
worshipped
him
28
10
then
said
jesus
unto
them
be
not
afraid
go
tell
my
brethren
that
they
go
into
galilee
and
there
shall
they
see
me
28
11
now
when
they
were
going
behold
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the
city
and
shewed
unto
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
that
were
done
28
12
and
when
they
were
assembled
with
the
elders
and
had
taken
counsel
they
gave
large
money
unto
the
soldiers
28
13
saying
say
ye
his
disciples
came
by
night
and
stole
him
away
while
we
slept
28
14
and
if
this
come
to
the
governor’s
ears
we
will
persuade
him
and
secure
you
28
15
so
they
took
the
money
and
did
as
they
were
taught
and
this
saying
is
commonly
reported
among
the
jews
until
this
day
28
16
then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
galilee
into
a
mountain
where
jesus
had
appointed
them
28
17
and
when
they
saw
him
they
worshipped
him
but
some
doubted
28
18
and
jesus
came
and
spake
unto
them
saying
all
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
28
19
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
28
20
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
and
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
amen
the
gospel
according
to
saint
mark
1
1
the
beginning
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
1
2
as
it
is
written
in
the
prophets
behold
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
1
3
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
straight
1
4
john
did
baptize
in
the
wilderness
and
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
1
5
and
there
went
out
unto
him
all
the
land
of
judaea
and
they
of
jerusalem
and
were
all
baptized
of
him
in
the
river
of
jordan
confessing
their
sins
1
6
and
john
was
clothed
with
camel’s
hair
and
with
a
girdle
of
a
skin
about
his
loins
and
he
did
eat
locusts
and
wild
honey
1
7
and
preached
saying
there
cometh
one
mightier
than
i
after
me
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
stoop
down
and
unloose
1
8
i
indeed
have
baptized
you
with
water
but
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
1
9
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
jesus
came
from
nazareth
of
galilee
and
was
baptized
of
john
in
jordan
1
10
and
straightway
coming
up
out
of
the
water
he
saw
the
heavens
opened
and
the
spirit
like
a
dove
descending
upon
him
1
11
and
there
came
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
thou
art
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
1
12
and
immediately
the
spirit
driveth
him
into
the
wilderness
1
13
and
he
was
there
in
the
wilderness
forty
days
tempted
of
satan
and
was
with
the
wild
beasts
and
the
angels
ministered
unto
him
1
14
now
after
that
john
was
put
in
prison
jesus
came
into
galilee
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
of
god
1
15
and
saying
the
time
is
fulfilled
and
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
hand
repent
ye
and
believe
the
gospel
1
16
now
as
he
walked
by
the
sea
of
galilee
he
saw
simon
and
andrew
his
brother
casting
a
net
into
the
sea
for
they
were
fishers
1
17
and
jesus
said
unto
them
come
ye
after
me
and
i
will
make
you
to
become
fishers
of
men
1
18
and
straightway
they
forsook
their
nets
and
followed
him
1
19
and
when
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
thence
he
saw
james
the
son
of
zebedee
and
john
his
brother
who
also
were
in
the
ship
mending
their
nets
1
20
and
straightway
he
called
them
and
they
left
their
father
zebedee
in
the
ship
with
the
hired
servants
and
went
after
him
1
21
and
they
went
into
capernaum
and
straightway
on
the
sabbath
day
he
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
1
22
and
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
for
he
taught
them
as
one
that
had
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
1
23
and
there
was
in
their
synagogue
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit
and
he
cried
out
1
24
saying
let
us
alone
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee
thou
jesus
of
nazareth
art
thou
come
to
destroy
us
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
holy
one
of
god
1
25
and
jesus
rebuked
him
saying
hold
thy
peace
and
come
out
of
him
1
26
and
when
the
unclean
spirit
had
torn
him
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
he
came
out
of
him
1
27
and
they
were
all
amazed
insomuch
that
they
questioned
among
themselves
saying
what
thing
is
this
what
new
doctrine
is
this
for
with
authority
commandeth
he
even
the
unclean
spirits
and
they
do
obey
him
1
28
and
immediately
his
fame
spread
abroad
throughout
all
the
region
round
about
galilee
1
29
and
forthwith
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
synagogue
they
entered
into
the
house
of
simon
and
andrew
with
james
and
john
1
30
but
simon’s
wife’s
mother
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
anon
they
tell
him
of
her
1
31
and
he
came
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
lifted
her
up
and
immediately
the
fever
left
her
and
she
ministered
unto
them
1
32
and
at
even
when
the
sun
did
set
they
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
diseased
and
them
that
were
possessed
with
devils
1
33
and
all
the
city
was
gathered
together
at
the
door
1
34
and
he
healed
many
that
were
sick
of
divers
diseases
and
cast
out
many
devils
and
suffered
not
the
devils
to
speak
because
they
knew
him
1
35
and
in
the
morning
rising
up
a
great
while
before
day
he
went
out
and
departed
into
a
solitary
place
and
there
prayed
1
36
and
simon
and
they
that
were
with
him
followed
after
him
1
37
and
when
they
had
found
him
they
said
unto
him
all
men
seek
for
thee
1
38
and
he
said
unto
them
let
us
go
into
the
next
towns
that
i
may
preach
there
also
for
therefore
came
i
forth
1
39
and
he
preached
in
their
synagogues
throughout
all
galilee
and
cast
out
devils
1
40
and
there
came
a
leper
to
him
beseeching
him
and
kneeling
down
to
him
and
saying
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
me
clean
1
41
and
jesus
moved
with
compassion
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
and
saith
unto
him
i
will
be
thou
clean
1
42
and
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
and
he
was
cleansed
1
43
and
he
straitly
charged
him
and
forthwith
sent
him
away
1
44
and
saith
unto
him
see
thou
say
nothing
to
any
man
but
go
thy
way
shew
thyself
to
the
priest
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
those
things
which
moses
commanded
for
a
testimony
unto
them
1
45
but
he
went
out
and
began
to
publish
it
much
and
to
blaze
abroad
the
matter
insomuch
that
jesus
could
no
more
openly
enter
into
the
city
but
was
without
in
desert
places
and
they
came
to
him
from
every
quarter
2
1
and
again
he
entered
into
capernaum
after
some
days
and
it
was
noised
that
he
was
in
the
house
2
2
and
straightway
many
were
gathered
together
insomuch
that
there
was
no
room
to
receive
them
no
not
so
much
as
about
the
door
and
he
preached
the
word
unto
them
2
3
and
they
come
unto
him
bringing
one
sick
of
the
palsy
which
was
borne
of
four
2
4
and
when
they
could
not
come
nigh
unto
him
for
the
press
they
uncovered
the
roof
where
he
was
and
when
they
had
broken
it
up
they
let
down
the
bed
wherein
the
sick
of
the
palsy
lay
2
5
when
jesus
saw
their
faith
he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy
son
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
2
6
but
there
was
certain
of
the
scribes
sitting
there
and
reasoning
in
their
hearts
2
7
why
doth
this
man
thus
speak
blasphemies
who
can
forgive
sins
but
god
only
2
8
and
immediately
when
jesus
perceived
in
his
spirit
that
they
so
reasoned
within
themselves
he
said
unto
them
why
reason
ye
these
things
in
your
hearts
2
9
whether
is
it
easier
to
say
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
or
to
say
arise
and
take
up
thy
bed
and
walk
2
10
but
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
sins
(he
saith
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy
)
2
11
i
say
unto
thee
arise
and
take
up
thy
bed
and
go
thy
way
into
thine
house
2
12
and
immediately
he
arose
took
up
the
bed
and
went
forth
before
them
all
insomuch
that
they
were
all
amazed
and
glorified
god
saying
we
never
saw
it
on
this
fashion
2
13
and
he
went
forth
again
by
the
sea
side
and
all
the
multitude
resorted
unto
him
and
he
taught
them
2
14
and
as
he
passed
by
he
saw
levi
the
son
of
alphaeus
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom
and
said
unto
him
follow
me
and
he
arose
and
followed
him
2
15
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
his
house
many
publicans
and
sinners
sat
also
together
with
jesus
and
his
disciples
for
there
were
many
and
they
followed
him
2
16
and
when
the
scribes
and
pharisees
saw
him
eat
with
publicans
and
sinners
they
said
unto
his
disciples
how
is
it
that
he
eateth
and
drinketh
with
publicans
and
sinners
2
17
when
jesus
heard
it
he
saith
unto
them
they
that
are
whole
have
no
need
of
the
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
i
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
2
18
and
the
disciples
of
john
and
of
the
pharisees
used
to
fast
and
they
come
and
say
unto
him
why
do
the
disciples
of
john
and
of
the
pharisees
fast
but
thy
disciples
fast
not
2
19
and
jesus
said
unto
them
can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
fast
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
as
long
as
they
have
the
bridegroom
with
them
they
cannot
fast
2
20
but
the
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
them
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
days
2
21
no
man
also
seweth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
on
an
old
garment
else
the
new
piece
that
filled
it
up
taketh
away
from
the
old
and
the
rent
is
made
worse
2
22
and
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
bottles
else
the
new
wine
doth
burst
the
bottles
and
the
wine
is
spilled
and
the
bottles
will
be
marred
but
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
bottles
2
23
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields
on
the
sabbath
day
and
his
disciples
began
as
they
went
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn
2
24
and
the
pharisees
said
unto
him
behold
why
do
they
on
the
sabbath
day
that
which
is
not
lawful
2
25
and
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
never
read
what
david
did
when
he
had
need
and
was
an
hungred
he
and
they
that
were
with
him
2
26
how
he
went
into
the
house
of
god
in
the
days
of
abiathar
the
high
priest
and
did
eat
the
shewbread
which
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
priests
and
gave
also
to
them
which
were
with
him
2
27
and
he
said
unto
them
the
sabbath
was
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath
2
28
therefore
the
son
of
man
is
lord
also
of
the
sabbath
3
1
and
he
entered
again
into
the
synagogue
and
there
was
a
man
there
which
had
a
withered
hand
3
2
and
they
watched
him
whether
he
would
heal
him
on
the
sabbath
day
that
they
might
accuse
him
3
3
and
he
saith
unto
the
man
which
had
the
withered
hand
stand
forth
3
4
and
he
saith
unto
them
is
it
lawful
to
do
good
on
the
sabbath
days
or
to
do
evil
to
save
life
or
to
kill
but
they
held
their
peace
3
5
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
on
them
with
anger
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
he
saith
unto
the
man
stretch
forth
thine
hand
and
he
stretched
it
out
and
his
hand
was
restored
whole
as
the
other
3
6
and
the
pharisees
went
forth
and
straightway
took
counsel
with
the
herodians
against
him
how
they
might
destroy
him
3
7
but
jesus
withdrew
himself
with
his
disciples
to
the
sea
and
a
great
multitude
from
galilee
followed
him
and
from
judaea
3
8
and
from
jerusalem
and
from
idumaea
and
from
beyond
jordan
and
they
about
tyre
and
sidon
a
great
multitude
when
they
had
heard
what
great
things
he
did
came
unto
him
3
9
and
he
spake
to
his
disciples
that
a
small
ship
should
wait
on
him
because
of
the
multitude
lest
they
should
throng
him
3
10
for
he
had
healed
many
insomuch
that
they
pressed
upon
him
for
to
touch
him
as
many
as
had
plagues
3
11
and
unclean
spirits
when
they
saw
him
fell
down
before
him
and
cried
saying
thou
art
the
son
of
god
3
12
and
he
straitly
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known
3
13
and
he
goeth
up
into
a
mountain
and
calleth
unto
him
whom
he
would
and
they
came
unto
him
3
14
and
he
ordained
twelve
that
they
should
be
with
him
and
that
he
might
send
them
forth
to
preach
3
15
and
to
have
power
to
heal
sicknesses
and
to
cast
out
devils
3
16
and
simon
he
surnamed
peter
3
17
and
james
the
son
of
zebedee
and
john
the
brother
of
james
and
he
surnamed
them
boanerges
which
is
the
sons
of
thunder
3
18
and
andrew
and
philip
and
bartholomew
and

the
son
of
alphaeus
and
thaddaeus
and
simon
the
canaanite
3
19
and
judas
iscariot
which
also
betrayed
him
and
they
went
into
an
house
3
20
and
the
multitude
cometh
together
again
so
that
they
could
not
so
much
as
eat
bread
3
21
and
when
his
friends
heard
of
it
they
went
out
to
lay
hold
on
him
for
they
said
he
is
beside
himself
3
22
and
the
scribes
which
came
down
from
jerusalem
said
he
hath
beelzebub
and
by
the
prince
of
the
devils
casteth
he
out
devils
3
23
and
he
called
them
unto
him
and
said
unto
them
in
parables
how
can
satan
cast
out
satan
3
24
and
if
a
kingdom
be
divided
against
itself
that
kingdom
cannot
stand
3
25
and
if
a
house
be
divided
against
itself
that
house
cannot
stand
3
26
and
if
satan
rise
up
against
himself
and
be
divided
he
cannot
stand
but
hath
an
end
3
27
no
man
can
enter
into
a
strong
man’s
house
and
spoil
his
goods
except
he
will
first
bind
the
strong
man
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
house
3
28
verily
i
say
unto
you
all
sins
shall
be
forgiven
unto
the
sons
of
men
and
blasphemies
wherewith
soever
they
shall
blaspheme
3
29
but
he
that
shall
blaspheme
against
the
holy
ghost
hath
never
forgiveness
but
is
in
danger
of
eternal
damnation
3
30
because
they
said
he
hath
an
unclean
spirit
3
31
there
came
then
his
brethren
and
his
mother
and
standing
without
sent
unto
him
calling
him
3
32
and
the
multitude
sat
about
him
and
they
said
unto
him
behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
without
seek
for
thee
3
33
and
he
answered
them
saying
who
is
my
mother
or
my
brethren
3
34
and
he
looked
round
about
on
them
which
sat
about
him
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren
3
35
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
god
the
same
is
my
brother
and
my
sister
and
mother
4
1
and
he
began
again
to
teach
by
the
sea
side
and
there
was
gathered
unto
him
a
great
multitude
so
that
he
entered
into
a
ship
and
sat
in
the
sea
and
the
whole
multitude
was
by
the
sea
on
the
land
4
2
and
he
taught
them
many
things
by
parables
and
said
unto
them
in
his
doctrine
4
3
hearken
behold
there
went
out
a
sower
to
sow
4
4
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
sowed
some
fell
by
the
way
side
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
came
and
devoured
it
up
4
5
and
some
fell
on
stony
ground
where
it
had
not
much
earth
and
immediately
it
sprang
up
because
it
had
no
depth
of
earth
4
6
but
when
the
sun
was
up
it
was
scorched
and
because
it
had
no
root
it
withered
away
4
7
and
some
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
grew
up
and
choked
it
and
it
yielded
no
fruit
4
8
and
other
fell
on
good
ground
and
did
yield
fruit
that
sprang
up
and
increased
and
brought
forth
some
thirty
and
some
sixty
and
some
an
hundred
4
9
and
he
said
unto
them
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
4
10
and
when
he
was
alone
they
that
were
about
him
with
the
twelve
asked
of
him
the
parable
4
11
and
he
said
unto
them
unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of
god
but
unto
them
that
are
without
all
these
things
are
done
in
parables
4
12
that
seeing
they
may
see
and
not
perceive
and
hearing
they
may
hear
and
not
understand
lest
at
any
time
they
should
be
converted
and
their
sins
should
be
forgiven
them
4
13
and
he
said
unto
them
know
ye
not
this
parable
and
how
then
will
ye
know
all
parables
4
14
the
sower
soweth
the
word
4
15
and
these
are
they
by
the
way
side
where
the
word
is
sown
but
when
they
have
heard
satan
cometh
immediately
and
taketh
away
the
word
that
was
sown
in
their
hearts
4
16
and
these
are
they
likewise
which
are
sown
on
stony
ground
who
when
they
have
heard
the
word
immediately
receive
it
with
gladness
4
17
and
have
no
root
in
themselves
and
so
endure
but
for
a
time
afterward
when
affliction
or
persecution
ariseth
for
the
word’s
sake
immediately
they
are
offended
4
18
and
these
are
they
which
are
sown
among
thorns
such
as
hear
the
word
4
19
and
the
cares
of
this
world
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
and
the
lusts
of
other
things
entering
in
choke
the
word
and
it
becometh
unfruitful
4
20
and
these
are
they
which
are
sown
on
good
ground
such
as
hear
the
word
and
receive
it
and
bring
forth
fruit
some
thirtyfold
some
sixty
and
some
an
hundred
4
21
and
he
said
unto
them
is
a
candle
brought
to
be
put
under
a
bushel
or
under
a
bed
and
not
to
be
set
on
a
candlestick
4
22
for
there
is
nothing
hid
which
shall
not
be
manifested
neither
was
any
thing
kept
secret
but
that
it
should
come
abroad
4
23
if
any
man
have
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
4
24
and
he
said
unto
them
take
heed
what
ye
hear
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
and
unto
you
that
hear
shall
more
be
given
4
25
for
he
that
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
he
that
hath
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
hath
4
26
and
he
said
so
is
the
kingdom
of
god
as
if
a
man
should
cast
seed
into
the
ground
4
27
and
should
sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
the
seed
should
spring
and
grow
up
he
knoweth
not
how
4
28
for
the
earth
bringeth
forth
fruit
of
herself
first
the
blade
then
the
ear
after
that
the
full
corn
in
the
ear
4
29
but
when
the
fruit
is
brought
forth
immediately
he
putteth
in
the
sickle
because
the
harvest
is
come
4
30
and
he
said
whereunto
shall
we
liken
the
kingdom
of
god
or
with
what
comparison
shall
we
compare
it
4
31
it
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
which
when
it
is
sown
in
the
earth
is
less
than
all
the
seeds
that
be
in
the
earth
4
32
but
when
it
is
sown
it
groweth
up
and
becometh
greater
than
all
herbs
and
shooteth
out
great
branches
so
that
the
fowls
of
the
air
may
lodge
under
the
shadow
of
it
4
33
and
with
many
such
parables
spake
he
the
word
unto
them
as
they
were
able
to
hear
it
4
34
but
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them
and
when
they
were
alone
he
expounded
all
things
to
his
disciples
4
35
and
the
same
day
when
the
even
was
come
he
saith
unto
them
let
us
pass
over
unto
the
other
side
4
36
and
when
they
had
sent
away
the
multitude
they
took
him
even
as
he
was
in
the
ship
and
there
were
also
with
him
other
little
ships
4
37
and
there
arose
a
great
storm
of
wind
and
the
waves
beat
into
the
ship
so
that
it
was
now
full
4
38
and
he
was
in
the
hinder
part
of
the
ship
asleep
on
a
pillow
and
they
awake
him
and
say
unto
him
master
carest
thou
not
that
we
perish
4
39
and
he
arose
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
said
unto
the
sea
peace
be
still
and
the
wind
ceased
and
there
was
a
great
calm
4
40
and
he
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
so
fearful
how
is
it
that
ye
have
no
faith
4
41
and
they
feared
exceedingly
and
said
one
to
another
what
manner
of
man
is
this
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
him
5
1
and
they
came
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
sea
into
the
country
of
the
gadarenes
5
2
and
when
he
was
come
out
of
the
ship
immediately
there
met
him
out
of
the
tombs
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit
5
3
who
had
his
dwelling
among
the
tombs
and
no
man
could
bind
him
no
not
with
chains
5
4
because
that
he
had
been
often
bound
with
fetters
and
chains
and
the
chains
had
been
plucked
asunder
by
him
and
the
fetters
broken
in
pieces
neither
could
any
man
tame
him
5
5
and
always
night
and
day
he
was
in
the
mountains
and
in
the
tombs
crying
and
cutting
himself
with
stones
5
6
but
when
he
saw
jesus
afar
off
he
ran
and
worshipped
him
5
7
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
jesus
thou
son
of
the
most
high
god
i
adjure
thee
by
god
that
thou
torment
me
not
5
8
for
he
said
unto
him
come
out
of
the
man
thou
unclean
spirit
5
9
and
he
asked
him
what
is
thy
name
and
he
answered
saying
my
name
is
legion
for
we
are
many
5
10
and
he
besought
him
much
that
he
would
not
send
them
away
out
of
the
country
5
11
now
there
was
there
nigh
unto
the
mountains
a
great
herd
of
swine
feeding
5
12
and
all
the
devils
besought
him
saying
send
us
into
the
swine
that
we
may
enter
into
them
5
13
and
forthwith
jesus
gave
them
leave
and
the
unclean
spirits
went
out
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
(they
were
about
two
thousand
)
and
were
choked
in
the
sea
5
14
and
they
that
fed
the
swine
fled
and
told
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
country
and
they
went
out
to
see
what
it
was
that
was
done
5
15
and
they
come
to
jesus
and
see
him
that
was
possessed
with
the
devil
and
had
the
legion
sitting
and
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
and
they
were
afraid
5
16
and
they
that
saw
it
told
them
how
it
befell
to
him
that
was
possessed
with
the
devil
and
also
concerning
the
swine
5
17
and
they
began
to
pray
him
to
depart
out
of
their
coasts
5
18
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
ship
he
that
had
been
possessed
with
the
devil
prayed
him
that
he
might
be
with
him
5
19
howbeit
jesus
suffered
him
not
but
saith
unto
him
go
home
to
thy
friends
and
tell
them
how
great
things
the
lord
hath
done
for
thee
and
hath
had
compassion
on
thee
5
20
and
he
departed
and
began
to
publish
in
decapolis
how
great
things
jesus
had
done
for
him
and
all
men
did
marvel
5
21
and
when
jesus
was
passed
over
again
by
ship
unto
the
other
side
much
people
gathered
unto
him
and
he
was
nigh
unto
the
sea
5
22
and
behold
there
cometh
one
of
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue
jairus
by
name
and
when
he
saw
him
he
fell
at
his
feet
5
23
and
besought
him
greatly
saying
my
little
daughter
lieth
at
the
point
of
death
i
pray
thee
come
and
lay
thy
hands
on
her
that
she
may
be
healed
and
she
shall
live
5
24
and
jesus
went
with
him
and
much
people
followed
him
and
thronged
him
5
25
and
a
certain
woman
which
had
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years
5
26
and
had
suffered
many
things
of
many
physicians
and
had
spent
all
that
she
had
and
was
nothing
bettered
but
rather
grew
worse
5
27
when
she
had
heard
of
jesus
came
in
the
press
behind
and
touched
his
garment
5
28
for
she
said
if
i
may
touch
but
his
clothes
i
shall
be
whole
5
29
and
straightway
the
fountain
of
her
blood
was
dried
up
and
she
felt
in
her
body
that
she
was
healed
of
that
plague
5
30
and
jesus
immediately
knowing
in
himself
that
virtue
had
gone
out
of
him
turned
him
about
in
the
press
and
said
who
touched
my
clothes
5
31
and
his
disciples
said
unto
him
thou
seest
the
multitude
thronging
thee
and
sayest
thou
who
touched
me
5
32
and
he
looked
round
about
to
see
her
that
had
done
this
thing
5
33
but
the
woman
fearing
and
trembling
knowing
what
was
done
in
her
came
and
fell
down
before
him
and
told
him
all
the
truth
5
34
and
he
said
unto
her
daughter
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
go
in
peace
and
be
whole
of
thy
plague
5
35
while
he
yet
spake
there
came
from
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue’s
house
certain
which
said
thy
daughter
is
dead
why
troublest
thou
the
master
any
further
5
36
as
soon
as
jesus
heard
the
word
that
was
spoken
he
saith
unto
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
be
not
afraid
only
believe
5
37
and
he
suffered
no
man
to
follow
him
save
peter
and
james
and
john
the
brother
of
james
5
38
and
he
cometh
to
the
house
of
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
and
seeth
the
tumult
and
them
that
wept
and
wailed
greatly
5
39
and
when
he
was
come
in
he
saith
unto
them
why
make
ye
this
ado
and
weep
the
damsel
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
5
40
and
they
laughed
him
to
scorn
but
when
he
had
put
them
all
out
he
taketh
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
damsel
and
them
that
were
with
him
and
entereth
in
where
the
damsel
was
lying
5
41
and
he
took
the
damsel
by
the
hand
and
said
unto
her
talitha
cumi
which
is
being
interpreted
damsel
i
say
unto
thee
arise
5
42
and
straightway
the
damsel
arose
and
walked
for
she
was
of
the
age
of
twelve
years
and
they
were
astonished
with
a
great
astonishment
5
43
and
he
charged
them
straitly
that
no
man
should
know
it
and
commanded
that
something
should
be
given
her
to
eat
6
1
and
he
went
out
from
thence
and
came
into
his
own
country
and
his
disciples
follow
him
6
2
and
when
the
sabbath
day
was
come
he
began
to
teach
in
the
synagogue
and
many
hearing
him
were
astonished
saying
from
whence
hath
this
man
these
things
and
what
wisdom
is
this
which
is
given
unto
him
that
even
such
mighty
works
are
wrought
by
his
hands
6
3
is
not
this
the
carpenter
the
son
of
mary
the
brother
of
james
and
joses
and
of
juda
and
simon
and
are
not
his
sisters
here
with
us
and
they
were
offended
at
him
6
4
but
jesus
said
unto
them
a
prophet
is
not
without
honour
but
in
his
own
country
and
among
his
own
kin
and
in
his
own
house
6
5
and
he
could
there
do
no
mighty
work
save
that
he
laid
his
hands
upon
a
few
sick
folk
and
healed
them
6
6
and
he
marvelled
because
of
their
unbelief
and
he
went
round
about
the
villages
teaching
6
7
and
he
called
unto
him
the
twelve
and
began
to
send
them
forth
by
two
and
two
and
gave
them
power
over
unclean
spirits
6
8
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
take
nothing
for
their
journey
save
a
staff
only
no
scrip
no
bread
no
money
in
their
purse
6
9
but
be
shod
with
sandals
and
not
put
on
two
coats
6
10
and
he
said
unto
them
in
what
place
soever
ye
enter
into
an
house
there
abide
till
ye
depart
from
that
place
6
11
and
whosoever
shall
not
receive
you
nor
hear
you
when
ye
depart
thence
shake
off
the
dust
under
your
feet
for
a
testimony
against
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
that
city
6
12
and
they
went
out
and
preached
that
men
should
repent
6
13
and
they
cast
out
many
devils
and
anointed
with
oil
many
that
were
sick
and
healed
them
6
14
and
king
herod
heard
of
him
(for
his
name
was
spread
abroad
)
and
he
said
that
john
the
baptist
was
risen
from
the
dead
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
him
6
15
others
said
that
it
is
elias
and
others
said
that
it
is
a
prophet
or
as
one
of
the
prophets
6
16
but
when
herod
heard
thereof
he
said
it
is
john
whom
i
beheaded
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
6
17
for
herod
himself
had
sent
forth
and
laid
hold
upon
john
and
bound
him
in
prison
for
herodias’
sake
his
brother
philip’s
wife
for
he
had
married
her
6
18
for
john
had
said
unto
herod
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
thy
brother’s
wife
6
19
therefore
herodias
had
a
quarrel
against
him
and
would
have
killed
him
but
she
could
not
6
20
for
herod
feared
john
knowing
that
he
was
a
just
man
and
an
holy
and
observed
him
and
when
he
heard
him
he
did
many
things
and
heard
him
gladly
6
21
and
when
a
convenient
day
was
come
that
herod
on
his
birthday
made
a
supper
to
his
lords
high
captains
and
chief
estates
of
galilee
6
22
and
when
the
daughter
of
the
said
herodias
came
in
and
danced
and
pleased
herod
and
them
that
sat
with
him
the
king
said
unto
the
damsel
ask
of
me
whatsoever
thou
wilt
and
i
will
give
it
thee
6
23
and
he
sware
unto
her
whatsoever
thou
shalt
ask
of
me
i
will
give
it
thee
unto
the
half
of
my
kingdom
6
24
and
she
went
forth
and
said
unto
her
mother
what
shall
i
ask
and
she
said
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
6
25
and
she
came
in
straightway
with
haste
unto
the
king
and
asked
saying
i
will
that
thou
give
me
by
and
by
in
a
charger
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
6
26
and
the
king
was
exceeding
sorry
yet
for
his
oath’s
sake
and
for
their
sakes
which
sat
with
him
he
would
not
reject
her
6
27
and
immediately
the
king
sent
an
executioner
and
commanded
his
head
to
be
brought
and
he
went
and
beheaded
him
in
the
prison
6
28
and
brought
his
head
in
a
charger
and
gave
it
to
the
damsel
and
the
damsel
gave
it
to
her
mother
6
29
and
when
his
disciples
heard
of
it
they
came
and
took
up
his
corpse
and
laid
it
in
a
tomb
6
30
and
the
apostles
gathered
themselves
together
unto
jesus
and
told
him
all
things
both
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
had
taught
6
31
and
he
said
unto
them
come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
place
and
rest
a
while
for
there
were
many
coming
and
going
and
they
had
no
leisure
so
much
as
to
eat
6
32
and
they
departed
into
a
desert
place
by
ship
privately
6
33
and
the
people
saw
them
departing
and
many
knew
him
and
ran
afoot
thither
out
of
all
cities
and
outwent
them
and
came
together
unto
him
6
34
and
jesus
when
he
came
out
saw
much
people
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
them
because
they
were
as
sheep
not
having
a
shepherd
and
he
began
to
teach
them
many
things
6
35
and
when
the
day
was
now
far
spent
his
disciples
came
unto
him
and
said
this
is
a
desert
place
and
now
the
time
is
far
passed
6
36
send
them
away
that
they
may
go
into
the
country
round
about
and
into
the
villages
and
buy
themselves
bread
for
they
have
nothing
to
eat
6
37
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
give
ye
them
to
eat
and
they
say
unto
him
shall
we
go
and
buy
two
hundred
pennyworth
of
bread
and
give
them
to
eat
6
38
he
saith
unto
them
how
many
loaves
have
ye
go
and
see
and
when
they
knew
they
say
five
and
two
fishes
6
39
and
he
commanded
them
to
make
all
sit
down
by
companies
upon
the
green
grass
6
40
and
they
sat
down
in
ranks
by
hundreds
and
by
fifties
6
41
and
when
he
had
taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
blessed
and
brake
the
loaves
and
gave
them
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
them
and
the
two
fishes
divided
he
among
them
all
6
42
and
they
did
all
eat
and
were
filled
6
43
and
they
took
up
twelve
baskets
full
of
the
fragments
and
of
the
fishes
6
44
and
they
that
did
eat
of
the
loaves
were
about
five
thousand
men
6
45
and
straightway
he
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
the
ship
and
to
go
to
the
other
side
before
unto
bethsaida
while
he
sent
away
the
people
6
46
and
when
he
had
sent
them
away
he
departed
into
a
mountain
to
pray
6
47
and
when
even
was
come
the
ship
was
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
he
alone
on
the
land
6
48
and
he
saw
them
toiling
in
rowing
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
them
and
about
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
cometh
unto
them
walking
upon
the
sea
and
would
have
passed
by
them
6
49
but
when
they
saw
him
walking
upon
the
sea
they
supposed
it
had
been
a
spirit
and
cried
out
6
50
for
they
all
saw
him
and
were
troubled
and
immediately
he
talked
with
them
and
saith
unto
them
be
of
good
cheer
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
6
51
and
he
went
up
unto
them
into
the
ship
and
the
wind
ceased
and
they
were
sore
amazed
in
themselves
beyond
measure
and
wondered
6
52
for
they
considered
not
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
for
their
heart
was
hardened
6
53
and
when
they
had
passed
over
they
came
into
the
land
of
gennesaret
and
drew
to
the
shore
6
54
and
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
ship
straightway
they
knew
him
6
55
and
ran
through
that
whole
region
round
about
and
began
to
carry
about
in
beds
those
that
were
sick
where
they
heard
he
was
6
56
and
whithersoever
he
entered
into
villages
or
cities
or
country
they
laid
the
sick
in
the
streets
and
besought
him
that
they
might
touch
if
it
were
but
the
border
of
his
garment
and
as
many
as
touched
him
were
made
whole
7
1
then
came
together
unto
him
the
pharisees
and
certain
of
the
scribes
which
came
from
jerusalem
7
2
and
when
they
saw
some
of
his
disciples
eat
bread
with
defiled
that
is
to
say
with
unwashen
hands
they
found
fault
7
3
for
the
pharisees
and
all
the
jews
except
they
wash
their
hands
oft
eat
not
holding
the
tradition
of
the
elders
7
4
and
when
they
come
from
the
market
except
they
wash
they
eat
not
and
many
other
things
there
be
which
they
have
received
to
hold
as
the
washing
of
cups
and
pots
brasen
vessels
and
of
tables
7
5
then
the
pharisees
and
scribes
asked
him
why
walk
not
thy
disciples
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
elders
but
eat
bread
with
unwashen
hands
7
6
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
well
hath
esaias
prophesied
of
you
hypocrites
as
it
is
written
this
people
honoureth
me
with
their
lips
but
their
heart
is
far
from
me
7
7
howbeit
in
vain
do
they
worship
me
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men
7
8
for
laying
aside
the
commandment
of
god
ye
hold
the
tradition
of
men
as
the
washing
of
pots
and
cups
and
many
other
such
like
things
ye
do
7
9
and
he
said
unto
them
full
well
ye
reject
the
commandment
of
god
that
ye
may
keep
your
own
tradition
7
10
for
moses
said
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
whoso
curseth
father
or
mother
let
him
die
the
death
7
11
but
ye
say
if
a
man
shall
say
to
his
father
or
mother
it
is
corban
that
is
to
say
a
gift
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me
he
shall
be
free
7
12
and
ye
suffer
him
no
more
to
do
ought
for
his
father
or
his
mother
7
13
making
the
word
of
god
of
none
effect
through
your
tradition
which
ye
have
delivered
and
many
such
like
things
do
ye
7
14
and
when
he
had
called
all
the
people
unto
him
he
said
unto
them
hearken
unto
me
every
one
of
you
and
understand
7
15
there
is
nothing
from
without
a
man
that
entering
into
him
can
defile
him
but
the
things
which
come
out
of
him
those
are
they
that
defile
the
man
7
16
if
any
man
have
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
7
17
and
when
he
was
entered
into
the
house
from
the
people
his
disciples
asked
him
concerning
the
parable
7
18
and
he
saith
unto
them
are
ye
so
without
understanding
also
do
ye
not
perceive
that
whatsoever
thing
from
without
entereth
into
the
man
it
cannot
defile
him
7
19
because
it
entereth
not
into
his
heart
but
into
the
belly
and
goeth
out
into
the
draught
purging
all
meats
7
20
and
he
said
that
which
cometh
out
of
the
man
that
defileth
the
man
7
21
for
from
within
out
of
the
heart
of
men
proceed
evil
thoughts
adulteries
fornications
murders
7
22
thefts
covetousness
wickedness
deceit
lasciviousness
an
evil
eye
blasphemy
pride
foolishness
7
23
all
these
evil
things
come
from
within
and
defile
the
man
7
24
and
from
thence
he
arose
and
went
into
the
borders
of
tyre
and
sidon
and
entered
into
an
house
and
would
have
no
man
know
it
but
he
could
not
be
hid
7
25
for
a
certain
woman
whose
young
daughter
had
an
unclean
spirit
heard
of
him
and
came
and
fell
at
his
feet
7
26
the
woman
was
a
greek
a
syrophenician
by
nation
and
she
besought
him
that
he
would
cast
forth
the
devil
out
of
her
daughter
7
27
but
jesus
said
unto
her
let
the
children
first
be
filled
for
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children’s
bread
and
to
cast
it
unto
the
dogs
7
28
and
she
answered
and
said
unto
him
yes
lord
yet
the
dogs
under
the
table
eat
of
the
children’s
crumbs
7
29
and
he
said
unto
her
for
this
saying
go
thy
way
the
devil
is
gone
out
of
thy
daughter
7
30
and
when
she
was
come
to
her
house
she
found
the
devil
gone
out
and
her
daughter
laid
upon
the
bed
7
31
and
again
departing
from
the
coasts
of
tyre
and
sidon
he
came
unto
the
sea
of
galilee
through
the
midst
of
the
coasts
of
decapolis
7
32
and
they
bring
unto
him
one
that
was
deaf
and
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech
and
they
beseech
him
to
put
his
hand
upon
him
7
33
and
he
took
him
aside
from
the
multitude
and
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
he
spit
and
touched
his
tongue
7
34
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
sighed
and
saith
unto
him
ephphatha
that
is
be
opened
7
35
and
straightway
his
ears
were
opened
and
the
string
of
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
he
spake
plain
7
36
and
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
but
the
more
he
charged
them
so
much
the
more
a
great
deal
they
published
it
7
37
and
were
beyond
measure
astonished
saying
he
hath
done
all
things
well
he
maketh
both
the
deaf
to
hear
and
the
dumb
to
speak
8
1
in
those
days
the
multitude
being
very
great
and
having
nothing
to
eat
jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
him
and
saith
unto
them
8
2
i
have
compassion
on
the
multitude
because
they
have
now
been
with
me
three
days
and
have
nothing
to
eat
8
3
and
if
i
send
them
away
fasting
to
their
own
houses
they
will
faint
by
the
way
for
divers
of
them
came
from
far
8
4
and
his
disciples
answered
him
from
whence
can
a
man
satisfy
these
men
with
bread
here
in
the
wilderness
8
5
and
he
asked
them
how
many
loaves
have
ye
and
they
said
seven
8
6
and
he
commanded
the
people
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
and
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
gave
thanks
and
brake
and
gave
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
them
and
they
did
set
them
before
the
people
8
7
and
they
had
a
few
small
fishes
and
he
blessed
and
commanded
to
set
them
also
before
them
8
8
so
they
did
eat
and
were
filled
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
baskets
8
9
and
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
four
thousand
and
he
sent
them
away
8
10
and
straightway
he
entered
into
a
ship
with
his
disciples
and
came
into
the
parts
of
dalmanutha
8
11
and
the
pharisees
came
forth
and
began
to
question
with
him
seeking
of
him
a
sign
from
heaven
tempting
him
8
12
and
he
sighed
deeply
in
his
spirit
and
saith
why
doth
this
generation
seek
after
a
sign
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
this
generation
8
13
and
he
left
them
and
entering
into
the
ship
again
departed
to
the
other
side
8
14
now
the
disciples
had
forgotten
to
take
bread
neither
had
they
in
the
ship
with
them
more
than
one
loaf
8
15
and
he
charged
them
saying
take
heed
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
leaven
of
herod
8
16
and
they
reasoned
among
themselves
saying
it
is
because
we
have
no
bread
8
17
and
when
jesus
knew
it
he
saith
unto
them
why
reason
ye
because
ye
have
no
bread
perceive
ye
not
yet
neither
understand
have
ye
your
heart
yet
hardened
8
18
having
eyes
see
ye
not
and
having
ears
hear
ye
not
and
do
ye
not
remember
8
19
when
i
brake
the
five
loaves
among
five
thousand
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
up
they
say
unto
him
twelve
8
20
and
when
the
seven
among
four
thousand
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
up
and
they
said
seven
8
21
and
he
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
8
22
and
he
cometh
to
bethsaida
and
they
bring
a
blind
man
unto
him
and
besought
him
to
touch
him
8
23
and
he
took
the
blind
man
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out
of
the
town
and
when
he
had
spit
on
his
eyes
and
put
his
hands
upon
him
he
asked
him
if
he
saw
ought
8
24
and
he
looked
up
and
said
i
see
men
as
trees
walking
8
25
after
that
he
put
his
hands
again
upon
his
eyes
and
made
him
look
up
and
he
was
restored
and
saw
every
man
clearly
8
26
and
he
sent
him
away
to
his
house
saying
neither
go
into
the
town
nor
tell
it
to
any
in
the
town
8
27
and
jesus
went
out
and
his
disciples
into
the
towns
of
caesarea
philippi
and
by
the
way
he
asked
his
disciples
saying
unto
them
whom
do
men
say
that
i
am
8
28
and
they
answered
john
the
baptist
but
some
say
elias
and
others
one
of
the
prophets
8
29
and
he
saith
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
and
peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
him
thou
art
the
christ
8
30
and
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
of
him
8
31
and
he
began
to
teach
them
that
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
of
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
killed
and
after
three
days
rise
again
8
32
and
he
spake
that
saying
openly
and
peter
took
him
and
began
to
rebuke
him
8
33
but
when
he
had
turned
about
and
looked
on
his
disciples
he
rebuked
peter
saying
get
thee
behind
me
satan
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
god
but
the
things
that
be
of
men
8
34
and
when
he
had
called
the
people
unto
him
with
his
disciples
also
he
said
unto
them
whosoever
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
8
35
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
and
the
gospel’s
the
same
shall
save
it
8
36
for
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
8
37
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
8
38
whosoever
therefore
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
in
this
adulterous
and
sinful
generation
of
him
also
shall
the
son
of
man
be
ashamed
when
he
cometh
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
the
holy
angels
9
1
and
he
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
there
be
some
of
them
that
stand
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
have
seen
the
kingdom
of
god
come
with
power
9
2
and
after
six
days
jesus
taketh
with
him
peter
and
james
and
john
and
leadeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
by
themselves
and
he
was
transfigured
before
them
9
3
and
his
raiment
became
shining
exceeding
white
as
snow
so
as
no
fuller
on
earth
can
white
them
9
4
and
there
appeared
unto
them
elias
with
moses
and
they
were
talking
with
jesus
9
5
and
peter
answered
and
said
to
jesus
master
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
and
let
us
make
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
moses
and
one
for
elias
9
6
for
he
wist
not
what
to
say
for
they
were
sore
afraid
9
7
and
there
was
a
cloud
that
overshadowed
them
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
cloud
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
9
8
and
suddenly
when
they
had
looked
round
about
they
saw
no
man
any
more
save
jesus
only
with
themselves
9
9
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
things
they
had
seen
till
the
son
of
man
were
risen
from
the
dead
9
10
and
they
kept
that
saying
with
themselves
questioning
one
with
another
what
the
rising
from
the
dead
should
mean
9
11
and
they
asked
him
saying
why
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
come
9
12
and
he
answered
and
told
them
elias
verily
cometh
first
and
restoreth
all
things
and
how
it
is
written
of
the
son
of
man
that
he
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
set
at
nought
9
13
but
i
say
unto
you
that
elias
is
indeed
come
and
they
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed
as
it
is
written
of
him
9
14
and
when
he
came
to
his
disciples
he
saw
a
great
multitude
about
them
and
the
scribes
questioning
with
them
9
15
and
straightway
all
the
people
when
they
beheld
him
were
greatly
amazed
and
running
to
him
saluted
him
9
16
and
he
asked
the
scribes
what
question
ye
with
them
9
17
and
one
of
the
multitude
answered
and
said
master
i
have
brought
unto
thee
my
son
which
hath
a
dumb
spirit
9
18
and
wheresoever
he
taketh
him
he
teareth
him
and
he
foameth
and
gnasheth
with
his
teeth
and
pineth
away
and
i
spake
to
thy
disciples
that
they
should
cast
him
out
and
they
could
not
9
19
he
answereth
him
and
saith
o
faithless
generation
how
long
shall
i
be
with
you
how
long
shall
i
suffer
you
bring
him
unto
me
9
20
and
they
brought
him
unto
him
and
when
he
saw
him
straightway
the
spirit
tare
him
and
he
fell
on
the
ground
and
wallowed
foaming
9
21
and
he
asked
his
father
how
long
is
it
ago
since
this
came
unto
him
and
he
said
of
a
child
9
22
and
ofttimes
it
hath
cast
him
into
the
fire
and
into
the
waters
to
destroy
him
but
if
thou
canst
do
any
thing
have
compassion
on
us
and
help
us
9
23
jesus
said
unto
him
if
thou
canst
believe
all
things
are
possible
to
him
that
believeth
9
24
and
straightway
the
father
of
the
child
cried
out
and
said
with
tears
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
9
25
when
jesus
saw
that
the
people
came
running
together
he
rebuked
the
foul
spirit
saying
unto
him
thou
dumb
and
deaf
spirit
i
charge
thee
come
out
of
him
and
enter
no
more
into
him
9
26
and
the
spirit
cried
and
rent
him
sore
and
came
out
of
him
and
he
was
as
one
dead
insomuch
that
many
said
he
is
dead
9
27
but
jesus
took
him
by
the
hand
and
lifted
him
up
and
he
arose
9
28
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
privately
why
could
not
we
cast
him
out
9
29
and
he
said
unto
them
this
kind
can
come
forth
by
nothing
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
9
30
and
they
departed
thence
and
passed
through
galilee
and
he
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
it
9
31
for
he
taught
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
the
son
of
man
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
after
that
he
is
killed
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
9
32
but
they
understood
not
that
saying
and
were
afraid
to
ask
him
9
33
and
he
came
to
capernaum
and
being
in
the
house
he
asked
them
what
was
it
that
ye
disputed
among
yourselves
by
the
way
9
34
but
they
held
their
peace
for
by
the
way
they
had
disputed
among
themselves
who
should
be
the
greatest
9
35
and
he
sat
down
and
called
the
twelve
and
saith
unto
them
if
any
man
desire
to
be
first
the
same
shall
be
last
of
all
and
servant
of
all
9
36
and
he
took
a
child
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
when
he
had
taken
him
in
his
arms
he
said
unto
them
9
37
whosoever
shall
receive
one
of
such
children
in
my
name
receiveth
me
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me
receiveth
not
me
but
him
that
sent
me
9
38
and
john
answered
him
saying
master
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
name
and
he
followeth
not
us
and
we
forbad
him
because
he
followeth
not
us
9
39
but
jesus
said
forbid
him
not
for
there
is
no
man
which
shall
do
a
miracle
in
my
name
that
can
lightly
speak
evil
of
me
9
40
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
on
our
part
9
41
for
whosoever
shall
give
you
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
in
my
name
because
ye
belong
to
christ
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
shall
not
lose
his
reward
9
42
and
whosoever
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
that
believe
in
me
it
is
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
he
were
cast
into
the
sea
9
43
and
if
thy
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
maimed
than
having
two
hands
to
go
into
hell
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
quenched
9
44
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
9
45
and
if
thy
foot
offend
thee
cut
it
off
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
halt
into
life
than
having
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
hell
into
the
fire
that
never
shall
be
quenched
9
46
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
9
47
and
if
thine
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
out
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
with
one
eye
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
fire
9
48
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
9
49
for
every
one
shall
be
salted
with
fire
and
every
sacrifice
shall
be
salted
with
salt
9
50
salt
is
good
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
saltness
wherewith
will
ye
season
it
have
salt
in
yourselves
and
have
peace
one
with
another
10
1
and
he
arose
from
thence
and
cometh
into
the
coasts
of
judaea
by
the
farther
side
of
jordan
and
the
people
resort
unto
him
again
and
as
he
was
wont
he
taught
them
again
10
2
and
the
pharisees
came
to
him
and
asked
him
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
tempting
him
10
3
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
what
did
moses
command
you
10
4
and
they
said
moses
suffered
to
write
a
bill
of
divorcement
and
to
put
her
away
10
5
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
for
the
hardness
of
your
heart
he
wrote
you
this
precept
10
6
but
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
god
made
them
male
and
female
10
7
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
cleave
to
his
wife
10
8
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
flesh
so
then
they
are
no
more
twain
but
one
flesh
10
9
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
10
10
and
in
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
again
of
the
same
matter
10
11
and
he
saith
unto
them
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
and
marry
another
committeth
adultery
against
her
10
12
and
if
a
woman
shall
put
away
her
husband
and
be
married
to
another
she
committeth
adultery
10
13
and
they
brought
young
children
to
him
that
he
should
touch
them
and
his
disciples
rebuked
those
that
brought
them
10
14
but
when
jesus
saw
it
he
was
much
displeased
and
said
unto
them
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
god
10
15
verily
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
child
he
shall
not
enter
therein
10
16
and
he
took
them
up
in
his
arms
put
his
hands
upon
them
and
blessed
them
10
17
and
when
he
was
gone
forth
into
the
way
there
came
one
running
and
kneeled
to
him
and
asked
him
good
master
what
shall
i
do
that
i
may
inherit
eternal
life
10
18
and
jesus
said
unto
him
why
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
10
19
thou
knowest
the
commandments
do
not
commit
adultery
do
not
kill
do
not
steal
do
not
bear
false
witness
defraud
not
honour
thy
father
and
mother
10
20
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
master
all
these
have
i
observed
from
my
youth
10
21
then
jesus
beholding
him
loved
him
and
said
unto
him
one
thing
thou
lackest
go
thy
way
sell
whatsoever
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
take
up
the
cross
and
follow
me
10
22
and
he
was
sad
at
that
saying
and
went
away
grieved
for
he
had
great
possessions
10
23
and
jesus
looked
round
about
and
saith
unto
his
disciples
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
10
24
and
the
disciples
were
astonished
at
his
words
but
jesus
answereth
again
and
saith
unto
them
children
how
hard
is
it
for
them
that
trust
in
riches
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
10
25
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
10
26
and
they
were
astonished
out
of
measure
saying
among
themselves
who
then
can
be
saved
10
27
and
jesus
looking
upon
them
saith
with
men
it
is
impossible
but
not
with
god
for
with
god
all
things
are
possible
10
28
then
peter
began
to
say
unto
him
lo
we
have
left
all
and
have
followed
thee
10
29
and
jesus
answered
and
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
house
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
sake
and
the
gospel’s
10
30
but
he
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
now
in
this
time
houses
and
brethren
and
sisters
and
mothers
and
children
and
lands
with
persecutions
and
in
the
world
to
come
eternal
life
10
31
but
many
that
are
first
shall
be
last
and
the
last
first
10
32
and
they
were
in
the
way
going
up
to
jerusalem
and
jesus
went
before
them
and
they
were
amazed
and
as
they
followed
they
were
afraid
and
he
took
again
the
twelve
and
began
to
tell
them
what
things
should
happen
unto
him
10
33
saying
behold
we
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
scribes
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
death
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
gentiles
10
34
and
they
shall
mock
him
and
shall
scourge
him
and
shall
spit
upon
him
and
shall
kill
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again
10
35
and
james
and
john
the
sons
of
zebedee
come
unto
him
saying
master
we
would
that
thou
shouldest
do
for
us
whatsoever
we
shall
desire
10
36
and
he
said
unto
them
what
would
ye
that
i
should
do
for
you
10
37
they
said
unto
him
grant
unto
us
that
we
may
sit
one
on
thy
right
hand
and
the
other
on
thy
left
hand
in
thy
glory
10
38
but
jesus
said
unto
them
ye
know
not
what
ye
ask
can
ye
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
drink
of
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
with
10
39
and
they
said
unto
him
we
can
and
jesus
said
unto
them
ye
shall
indeed
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
drink
of
and
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
withal
shall
ye
be
baptized
10
40
but
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
hand
is
not
mine
to
give
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared
10
41
and
when
the
ten
heard
it
they
began
to
be
much
displeased
with
james
and
john
10
42
but
jesus
called
them
to
him
and
saith
unto
them
ye
know
that
they
which
are
accounted
to
rule
over
the
gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
them
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
upon
them
10
43
but
so
shall
it
not
be
among
you
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you
shall
be
your
minister
10
44
and
whosoever
of
you
will
be
the
chiefest
shall
be
servant
of
all
10
45
for
even
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many
10
46
and
they
came
to
jericho
and
as
he
went
out
of
jericho
with
his
disciples
and
a
great
number
of
people
blind
bartimaeus
the
son
of
timaeus
sat
by
the
highway
side
begging
10
47
and
when
he
heard
that
it
was
jesus
of
nazareth
he
began
to
cry
out
and
say
jesus
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
me
10
48
and
many
charged
him
that
he
should
hold
his
peace
but
he
cried
the
more
a
great
deal
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
me
10
49
and
jesus
stood
still
and
commanded
him
to
be
called
and
they
call
the
blind
man
saying
unto
him
be
of
good
comfort
rise
he
calleth
thee
10
50
and
he
casting
away
his
garment
rose
and
came
to
jesus
10
51
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
what
wilt
thou
that
i
should
do
unto
thee
the
blind
man
said
unto
him
lord
that
i
might
receive
my
sight
10
52
and
jesus
said
unto
him
go
thy
way
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
and
immediately
he
received
his
sight
and
followed
jesus
in
the
way
11
1
and
when
they
came
nigh
to
jerusalem
unto
bethphage
and
bethany
at
the
mount
of
olives
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
disciples
11
2
and
saith
unto
them
go
your
way
into
the
village
over
against
you
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
entered
into
it
ye
shall
find
a
colt
tied
whereon
never
man
sat
loose
him
and
bring
him
11
3
and
if
any
man
say
unto
you
why
do
ye
this
say
ye
that
the
lord
hath
need
of
him
and
straightway
he
will
send
him
hither
11
4
and
they
went
their
way
and
found
the
colt
tied
by
the
door
without
in
a
place
where
two
ways
met
and
they
loose
him
11
5
and
certain
of
them
that
stood
there
said
unto
them
what
do
ye
loosing
the
colt
11
6
and
they
said
unto
them
even
as
jesus
had
commanded
and
they
let
them
go
11
7
and
they
brought
the
colt
to
jesus
and
cast
their
garments
on
him
and
he
sat
upon
him
11
8
and
many
spread
their
garments
in
the
way
and
others
cut
down
branches
off
the
trees
and
strawed
them
in
the
way
11
9
and
they
that
went
before
and
they
that
followed
cried
saying
hosanna
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
11
10
blessed
be
the
kingdom
of
our
father
david
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
hosanna
in
the
highest
11
11
and
jesus
entered
into
jerusalem
and
into
the
temple
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
upon
all
things
and
now
the
eventide
was
come
he
went
out
unto
bethany
with
the
twelve
11
12
and
on
the
morrow
when
they
were
come
from
bethany
he
was
hungry
11
13
and
seeing
a
fig
tree
afar
off
having
leaves
he
came
if
haply
he
might
find
any
thing
thereon
and
when
he
came
to
it
he
found
nothing
but
leaves
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
yet
11
14
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
it
no
man
eat
fruit
of
thee
hereafter
for
ever
and
his
disciples
heard
it
11
15
and
they
come
to
jerusalem
and
jesus
went
into
the
temple
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
doves
11
16
and
would
not
suffer
that
any
man
should
carry
any
vessel
through
the
temple
11
17
and
he
taught
saying
unto
them
is
it
not
written
my
house
shall
be
called
of
all
nations
the
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
11
18
and
the
scribes
and
chief
priests
heard
it
and
sought
how
they
might
destroy
him
for
they
feared
him
because
all
the
people
was
astonished
at
his
doctrine
11
19
and
when
even
was
come
he
went
out
of
the
city
11
20
and
in
the
morning
as
they
passed
by
they
saw
the
fig
tree
dried
up
from
the
roots
11
21
and
peter
calling
to
remembrance
saith
unto
him
master
behold
the
fig
tree
which
thou
cursedst
is
withered
away
11
22
and
jesus
answering
saith
unto
them
have
faith
in
god
11
23
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
removed
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea
and
shall
not
doubt
in
his
heart
but
shall
believe
that
those
things
which
he
saith
shall
come
to
pass
he
shall
have
whatsoever
he
saith
11
24
therefore
i
say
unto
you
what
things
soever
ye
desire
when
ye
pray
believe
that
ye
receive
them
and
ye
shall
have
them
11
25
and
when
ye
stand
praying
forgive
if
ye
have
ought
against
any
that
your
father
also
which
is
in
heaven
may
forgive
you
your
trespasses
11
26
but
if
ye
do
not
forgive
neither
will
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
forgive
your
trespasses
11
27
and
they
come
again
to
jerusalem
and
as
he
was
walking
in
the
temple
there
come
to
him
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
11
28
and
say
unto
him
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
to
do
these
things
11
29
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
will
also
ask
of
you
one
question
and
answer
me
and
i
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
11
30
the
baptism
of
john
was
it
from
heaven
or
of
men
answer
me
11
31
and
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
if
we
shall
say
from
heaven
he
will
say
why
then
did
ye
not
believe
him
11
32
but
if
we
shall
say
of
men
they
feared
the
people
for
all
men
counted
john
that
he
was
a
prophet
indeed
11
33
and
they
answered
and
said
unto
jesus
we
cannot
tell
and
jesus
answering
saith
unto
them
neither
do
i
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
12
1
and
he
began
to
speak
unto
them
by
parables
a
certain
man
planted
a
vineyard
and
set
an
hedge
about
it
and
digged
a
place
for
the
winefat
and
built
a
tower
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen
and
went
into
a
far
country
12
2
and
at
the
season
he
sent
to
the
husbandmen
a
servant
that
he
might
receive
from
the
husbandmen
of
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
12
3
and
they
caught
him
and
beat
him
and
sent
him
away
empty
12
4
and
again
he
sent
unto
them
another
servant
and
at
him
they
cast
stones
and
wounded
him
in
the
head
and
sent
him
away
shamefully
handled
12
5
and
again
he
sent
another
and
him
they
killed
and
many
others
beating
some
and
killing
some
12
6
having
yet
therefore
one
son
his
wellbeloved
he
sent
him
also
last
unto
them
saying
they
will
reverence
my
son
12
7
but
those
husbandmen
said
among
themselves
this
is
the
heir
come
let
us
kill
him
and
the
inheritance
shall
be
ours
12
8
and
they
took
him
and
killed
him
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard
12
9
what
shall
therefore
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do
he
will
come
and
destroy
the
husbandmen
and
will
give
the
vineyard
unto
others
12
10
and
have
ye
not
read
this
scripture
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
12
11
this
was
the
lord’s
doing
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes
12
12
and
they
sought
to
lay
hold
on
him
but
feared
the
people
for
they
knew
that
he
had
spoken
the
parable
against
them
and
they
left
him
and
went
their
way
12
13
and
they
send
unto
him
certain
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
herodians
to
catch
him
in
his
words
12
14
and
when
they
were
come
they
say
unto
him
master
we
know
that
thou
art
true
and
carest
for
no
man
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men
but
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
truth
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
to
caesar
or
not
12
15
shall
we
give
or
shall
we
not
give
but
he
knowing
their
hypocrisy
said
unto
them
why
tempt
ye
me
bring
me
a
penny
that
i
may
see
it
12
16
and
they
brought
it
and
he
saith
unto
them
whose
is
this
image
and
superscription
and
they
said
unto
him
caesar’s
12
17
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
render
to
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar’s
and
to
god
the
things
that
are
god’s
and
they
marvelled
at
him
12
18
then
come
unto
him
the
sadducees
which
say
there
is
no
resurrection
and
they
asked
him
saying
12
19
master
moses
wrote
unto
us
if
a
man’s
brother
die
and
leave
his
wife
behind
him
and
leave
no
children
that
his
brother
should
take
his
wife
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother
12
20
now
there
were
seven
brethren
and
the
first
took
a
wife
and
dying
left
no
seed
12
21
and
the
second
took
her
and
died
neither
left
he
any
seed
and
the
third
likewise
12
22
and
the
seven
had
her
and
left
no
seed
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also
12
23
in
the
resurrection
therefore
when
they
shall
rise
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
them
for
the
seven
had
her
to
wife
12
24
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
do
ye
not
therefore
err
because
ye
know
not
the
scriptures
neither
the
power
of
god
12
25
for
when
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven
12
26
and
as
touching
the
dead
that
they
rise
have
ye
not
read
in
the
book
of
moses
how
in
the
bush
god
spake
unto
him
saying
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
12
27
he
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
the
god
of
the
living
ye
therefore
do
greatly
err
12
28
and
one
of
the
scribes
came
and
having
heard
them
reasoning
together
and
perceiving
that
he
had
answered
them
well
asked
him
which
is
the
first
commandment
of
all
12
29
and
jesus
answered
him
the
first
of
all
the
commandments
is
hear
o
israel
the
lord
our
god
is
one
lord
12
30
and
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
with
all
thy
strength
this
is
the
first
commandment
12
31
and
the
second
is
like
namely
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
there
is
none
other
commandment
greater
than
these
12
32
and
the
scribe
said
unto
him
well
master
thou
hast
said
the
truth
for
there
is
one
god
and
there
is
none
other
but
he
12
33
and
to
love
him
with
all
the
heart
and
with
all
the
understanding
and
with
all
the
soul
and
with
all
the
strength
and
to
love
his
neighbour
as
himself
is
more
than
all
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
12
34
and
when
jesus
saw
that
he
answered
discreetly
he
said
unto
him
thou
art
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
god
and
no
man
after
that
durst
ask
him
any
question
12
35
and
jesus
answered
and
said
while
he
taught
in
the
temple
how
say
the
scribes
that
christ
is
the
son
of
david
12
36
for
david
himself
said
by
the
holy
ghost
the
lord
said
to
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
12
37
david
therefore
himself
calleth
him
lord
and
whence
is
he
then
his
son
and
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
12
38
and
he
said
unto
them
in
his
doctrine
beware
of
the
scribes
which
love
to
go
in
long
clothing
and
love
salutations
in
the
marketplaces
12
39
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts
12
40
which
devour
widows’
houses
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayers
these
shall
receive
greater
damnation
12
41
and
jesus
sat
over
against
the
treasury
and
beheld
how
the
people
cast
money
into
the
treasury
and
many
that
were
rich
cast
in
much
12
42
and
there
came
a
certain
poor
widow
and
she
threw
in
two
mites
which
make
a
farthing
12
43
and
he
called
unto
him
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
more
in
than
all
they
which
have
cast
into
the
treasury
12
44
for
all
they
did
cast
in
of
their
abundance
but
she
of
her
want
did
cast
in
all
that
she
had
even
all
her
living
13
1
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
temple
one
of
his
disciples
saith
unto
him
master
see
what
manner
of
stones
and
what
buildings
are
here
13
2
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
seest
thou
these
great
buildings
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down
13
3
and
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
olives
over
against
the
temple
peter
and
james
and
john
and
andrew
asked
him
privately
13
4
tell
us
when
shall
these
things
be
and
what
shall
be
the
sign
when
all
these
things
shall
be
fulfilled
13
5
and
jesus
answering
them
began
to
say
take
heed
lest
any
man
deceive
you
13
6
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name
saying
i
am
christ
and
shall
deceive
many
13
7
and
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
be
ye
not
troubled
for
such
things
must
needs
be
but
the
end
shall
not
be
yet
13
8
for
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
shall
be
earthquakes
in
divers
places
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
troubles
these
are
the
beginnings
of
sorrows
13
9
but
take
heed
to
yourselves
for
they
shall
deliver
you
up
to
councils
and
in
the
synagogues
ye
shall
be
beaten
and
ye
shall
be
brought
before
rulers
and
kings
for
my
sake
for
a
testimony
against
them
13
10
and
the
gospel
must
first
be
published
among
all
nations
13
11
but
when
they
shall
lead
you
and
deliver
you
up
take
no
thought
beforehand
what
ye
shall
speak
neither
do
ye
premeditate
but
whatsoever
shall
be
given
you
in
that
hour
that
speak
ye
for
it
is
not
ye
that
speak
but
the
holy
ghost
13
12
now
the
brother
shall
betray
the
brother
to
death
and
the
father
the
son
and
children
shall
rise
up
against
their
parents
and
shall
cause
them
to
be
put
to
death
13
13
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name’s
sake
but
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved
13
14
but
when
ye
shall
see
the
abomination
of
desolation
spoken
of
by
daniel
the
prophet
standing
where
it
ought
not
(let
him
that
readeth
understand
)
then
let
them
that
be
in
judaea
flee
to
the
mountains
13
15
and
let
him
that
is
on
the
housetop
not
go
down
into
the
house
neither
enter
therein
to
take
any
thing
out
of
his
house
13
16
and
let
him
that
is
in
the
field
not
turn
back
again
for
to
take
up
his
garment
13
17
but
woe
to
them
that
are
with
child
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days
13
18
and
pray
ye
that
your
flight
be
not
in
the
winter
13
19
for
in
those
days
shall
be
affliction
such
as
was
not
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
which
god
created
unto
this
time
neither
shall
be
13
20
and
except
that
the
lord
had
shortened
those
days
no
flesh
should
be
saved
but
for
the
elect’s
sake
whom
he
hath
chosen
he
hath
shortened
the
days
13
21
and
then
if
any
man
shall
say
to
you
lo
here
is
christ
or
lo
he
is
there
believe
him
not
13
22
for
false
christs
and
false
prophets
shall
rise
and
shall
shew
signs
and
wonders
to
seduce
if
it
were
possible
even
the
elect
13
23
but
take
ye
heed
behold
i
have
foretold
you
all
things
13
24
but
in
those
days
after
that
tribulation
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
13
25
and
the
stars
of
heaven
shall
fall
and
the
powers
that
are
in
heaven
shall
be
shaken
13
26
and
then
shall
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
with
great
power
and
glory
13
27
and
then
shall
he
send
his
angels
and
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds
from
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
to
the
uttermost
part
of
heaven
13
28
now
learn
a
parable
of
the
fig
tree
when
her
branch
is
yet
tender
and
putteth
forth
leaves
ye
know
that
summer
is
near
13
29
so
ye
in
like
manner
when
ye
shall
see
these
things
come
to
pass
know
that
it
is
nigh
even
at
the
doors
13
30
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
this
generation
shall
not
pass
till
all
these
things
be
done
13
31
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away
13
32
but
of
that
day
and
that
hour
knoweth
no
man
no
not
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven
neither
the
son
but
the
father
13
33
take
ye
heed
watch
and
pray
for
ye
know
not
when
the
time
is
13
34
for
the
son
of
man
is
as
a
man
taking
a
far
journey
who
left
his
house
and
gave
authority
to
his
servants
and
to
every
man
his
work
and
commanded
the
porter
to
watch
13
35
watch
ye
therefore
for
ye
know
not
when
the
master
of
the
house
cometh
at
even
or
at
midnight
or
at
the
cockcrowing
or
in
the
morning
13
36
lest
coming
suddenly
he
find
you
sleeping
13
37
and
what
i
say
unto
you
i
say
unto
all
watch
14
1
after
two
days
was
the
feast
of
the
passover
and
of
unleavened
bread
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
sought
how
they
might
take
him
by
craft
and
put
him
to
death
14
2
but
they
said
not
on
the
feast
day
lest
there
be
an
uproar
of
the
people
14
3
and
being
in
bethany
in
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
as
he
sat
at
meat
there
came
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
ointment
of
spikenard
very
precious
and
she
brake
the
box
and
poured
it
on
his
head
14
4
and
there
were
some
that
had
indignation
within
themselves
and
said
why
was
this
waste
of
the
ointment
made
14
5
for
it
might
have
been
sold
for
more
than
three
hundred
pence
and
have
been
given
to
the
poor
and
they
murmured
against
her
14
6
and
jesus
said
let
her
alone
why
trouble
ye
her
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
on
me
14
7
for
ye
have
the
poor
with
you
always
and
whensoever
ye
will
ye
may
do
them
good
but
me
ye
have
not
always
14
8
she
hath
done
what
she
could
she
is
come
aforehand
to
anoint
my
body
to
the
burying
14
9
verily
i
say
unto
you
wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
throughout
the
whole
world
this
also
that
she
hath
done
shall
be
spoken
of
for
a
memorial
of
her
14
10
and
judas
iscariot
one
of
the
twelve
went
unto
the
chief
priests
to
betray
him
unto
them
14
11
and
when
they
heard
it
they
were
glad
and
promised
to
give
him
money
and
he
sought
how
he
might
conveniently
betray
him
14
12
and
the
first
day
of
unleavened
bread
when
they
killed
the
passover
his
disciples
said
unto
him
where
wilt
thou
that
we
go
and
prepare
that
thou
mayest
eat
the
passover
14
13
and
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
go
ye
into
the
city
and
there
shall
meet
you
a
man
bearing
a
pitcher
of
water
follow
him
14
14
and
wheresoever
he
shall
go
in
say
ye
to
the
goodman
of
the
house
the
master
saith
where
is
the
guestchamber
where
i
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
disciples
14
15
and
he
will
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
furnished
and
prepared
there
make
ready
for
us
14
16
and
his
disciples
went
forth
and
came
into
the
city
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
14
17
and
in
the
evening
he
cometh
with
the
twelve
14
18
and
as
they
sat
and
did
eat
jesus
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
one
of
you
which
eateth
with
me
shall
betray
me
14
19
and
they
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
to
say
unto
him
one
by
one
is
it
i
and
another
said
is
it
i
14
20
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
it
is
one
of
the
twelve
that
dippeth
with
me
in
the
dish
14
21
the
son
of
man
indeed
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
him
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
good
were
it
for
that
man
if
he
had
never
been
born
14
22
and
as
they
did
eat
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
and
brake
it
and
gave
to
them
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
14
23
and
he
took
the
cup
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
gave
it
to
them
and
they
all
drank
of
it
14
24
and
he
said
unto
them
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
14
25
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
will
drink
no
more
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
that
i
drink
it
new
in
the
kingdom
of
god
14
26
and
when
they
had
sung
an
hymn
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
olives
14
27
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
all
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night
for
it
is
written
i
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered
14
28
but
after
that
i
am
risen
i
will
go
before
you
into
galilee
14
29
but
peter
said
unto
him
although
all
shall
be
offended
yet
will
not
i
14
30
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
verily
i
say
unto
thee
that
this
day
even
in
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
14
31
but
he
spake
the
more
vehemently
if
i
should
die
with
thee
i
will
not
deny
thee
in
any
wise
likewise
also
said
they
all
14
32
and
they
came
to
a
place
which
was
named
gethsemane
and
he
saith
to
his
disciples
sit
ye
here
while
i
shall
pray
14
33
and
he
taketh
with
him
peter
and
james
and
john
and
began
to
be
sore
amazed
and
to
be
very
heavy
14
34
and
saith
unto
them
my
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful
unto
death
tarry
ye
here
and
watch
14
35
and
he
went
forward
a
little
and
fell
on
the
ground
and
prayed
that
if
it
were
possible
the
hour
might
pass
from
him
14
36
and
he
said
abba
father
all
things
are
possible
unto
thee
take
away
this
cup
from
me
nevertheless
not
what
i
will
but
what
thou
wilt
14
37
and
he
cometh
and
findeth
them
sleeping
and
saith
unto
peter
simon
sleepest
thou
couldest
not
thou
watch
one
hour
14
38
watch
ye
and
pray
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation
the
spirit
truly
is
ready
but
the
flesh
is
weak
14
39
and
again
he
went
away
and
prayed
and
spake
the
same
words
14
40
and
when
he
returned
he
found
them
asleep
again
(for
their
eyes
were
heavy
)
neither
wist
they
what
to
answer
him
14
41
and
he
cometh
the
third
time
and
saith
unto
them
sleep
on
now
and
take
your
rest
it
is
enough
the
hour
is
come
behold
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners
14
42
rise
up
let
us
go
lo
he
that
betrayeth
me
is
at
hand
14
43
and
immediately
while
he
yet
spake
cometh
judas
one
of
the
twelve
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
14
44
and
he
that
betrayed
him
had
given
them
a
token
saying
whomsoever
i
shall
kiss
that
same
is
he
take
him
and
lead
him
away
safely
14
45
and
as
soon
as
he
was
come
he
goeth
straightway
to
him
and
saith
master
master
and
kissed
him
14
46
and
they
laid
their
hands
on
him
and
took
him
14
47
and
one
of
them
that
stood
by
drew
a
sword
and
smote
a
servant
of
the
high
priest
and
cut
off
his
ear
14
48
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
are
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
with
staves
to
take
me
14
49
i
was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching
and
ye
took
me
not
but
the
scriptures
must
be
fulfilled
14
50
and
they
all
forsook
him
and
fled
14
51
and
there
followed
him
a
certain
young
man
having
a
linen
cloth
cast
about
his
naked
body
and
the
young
men
laid
hold
on
him
14
52
and
he
left
the
linen
cloth
and
fled
from
them
naked
14
53
and
they
led
jesus
away
to
the
high
priest
and
with
him
were
assembled
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
14
54
and
peter
followed
him
afar
off
even
into
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
and
he
sat
with
the
servants
and
warmed
himself
at
the
fire
14
55
and
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
council
sought
for
witness
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
death
and
found
none
14
56
for
many
bare
false
witness
against
him
but
their
witness
agreed
not
together
14
57
and
there
arose
certain
and
bare
false
witness
against
him
saying
14
58
we
heard
him
say
i
will
destroy
this
temple
that
is
made
with
hands
and
within
three
days
i
will
build
another
made
without
hands
14
59
but
neither
so
did
their
witness
agree
together
14
60
and
the
high
priest
stood
up
in
the
midst
and
asked
jesus
saying
answerest
thou
nothing
what
is
it
which
these
witness
against
thee
14
61
but
he
held
his
peace
and
answered
nothing
again
the
high
priest
asked
him
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
14
62
and
jesus
said
i
am
and
ye
shall
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
14
63
then
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes
and
saith
what
need
we
any
further
witnesses
14
64
ye
have
heard
the
blasphemy
what
think
ye
and
they
all
condemned
him
to
be
guilty
of
death
14
65
and
some
began
to
spit
on
him
and
to
cover
his
face
and
to
buffet
him
and
to
say
unto
him
prophesy
and
the
servants
did
strike
him
with
the
palms
of
their
hands
14
66
and
as
peter
was
beneath
in
the
palace
there
cometh
one
of
the
maids
of
the
high
priest
14
67
and
when
she
saw
peter
warming
himself
she
looked
upon
him
and
said
and
thou
also
wast
with
jesus
of
nazareth
14
68
but
he
denied
saying
i
know
not
neither
understand
i
what
thou
sayest
and
he
went
out
into
the
porch
and
the
cock
crew
14
69
and
a
maid
saw
him
again
and
began
to
say
to
them
that
stood
by
this
is
one
of
them
14
70
and
he
denied
it
again
and
a
little
after
they
that
stood
by
said
again
to
peter
surely
thou
art
one
of
them
for
thou
art
a
galilaean
and
thy
speech
agreeth
thereto
14
71
but
he
began
to
curse
and
to
swear
saying
i
know
not
this
man
of
whom
ye
speak
14
72
and
the
second
time
the
cock
crew
and
peter
called
to
mind
the
word
that
jesus
said
unto
him
before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
and
when
he
thought
thereon
he
wept
15
1
and
straightway
in
the
morning
the
chief
priests
held
a
consultation
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
the
whole
council
and
bound
jesus
and
carried
him
away
and
delivered
him
to
pilate
15
2
and
pilate
asked
him
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
and
he
answering
said
unto
them
thou
sayest
it
15
3
and
the
chief
priests
accused
him
of
many
things
but
he
answered
nothing
15
4
and
pilate
asked
him
again
saying
answerest
thou
nothing
behold
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee
15
5
but
jesus
yet
answered
nothing
so
that
pilate
marvelled
15
6
now
at
that
feast
he
released
unto
them
one
prisoner
whomsoever
they
desired
15
7
and
there
was
one
named
barabbas
which
lay
bound
with
them
that
had
made
insurrection
with
him
who
had
committed
murder
in
the
insurrection
15
8
and
the
multitude
crying
aloud
began
to
desire
him
to
do
as
he
had
ever
done
unto
them
15
9
but
pilate
answered
them
saying
will
ye
that
i
release
unto
you
the
king
of
the
jews
15
10
for
he
knew
that
the
chief
priests
had
delivered
him
for
envy
15
11
but
the
chief
priests
moved
the
people
that
he
should
rather
release
barabbas
unto
them
15
12
and
pilate
answered
and
said
again
unto
them
what
will
ye
then
that
i
shall
do
unto
him
whom
ye
call
the
king
of
the
jews
15
13
and
they
cried
out
again
crucify
him
15
14
then
pilate
said
unto
them
why
what
evil
hath
he
done
and
they
cried
out
the
more
exceedingly
crucify
him
15
15
and
so
pilate
willing
to
content
the
people
released
barabbas
unto
them
and
delivered
jesus
when
he
had
scourged
him
to
be
crucified
15
16
and
the
soldiers
led
him
away
into
the
hall
called
praetorium
and
they
call
together
the
whole
band
15
17
and
they
clothed
him
with
purple
and
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
about
his
head
15
18
and
began
to
salute
him
hail
king
of
the
jews
15
19
and
they
smote
him
on
the
head
with
a
reed
and
did
spit
upon
him
and
bowing
their
knees
worshipped
him
15
20
and
when
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
off
the
purple
from
him
and
put
his
own
clothes
on
him
and
led
him
out
to
crucify
him
15
21
and
they
compel
one
simon
a
cyrenian
who
passed
by
coming
out
of
the
country
the
father
of
alexander
and
rufus
to
bear
his
cross
15
22
and
they
bring
him
unto
the
place
golgotha
which
is
being
interpreted
the
place
of
a
skull
15
23
and
they
gave
him
to
drink
wine
mingled
with
myrrh
but
he
received
it
not
15
24
and
when
they
had
crucified
him
they
parted
his
garments
casting
lots
upon
them
what
every
man
should
take
15
25
and
it
was
the
third
hour
and
they
crucified
him
15
26
and
the
superscription
of
his
accusation
was
written
over
the
king
of
the
jews
15
27
and
with
him
they
crucify
two
thieves
the
one
on
his
right
hand
and
the
other
on
his
left
15
28
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
which
saith
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
15
29
and
they
that
passed
by
railed
on
him
wagging
their
heads
and
saying
ah
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
and
buildest
it
in
three
days
15
30
save
thyself
and
come
down
from
the
cross
15
31
likewise
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
said
among
themselves
with
the
scribes
he
saved
others
himself
he
cannot
save
15
32
let
christ
the
king
of
israel
descend
now
from
the
cross
that
we
may
see
and
believe
and
they
that
were
crucified
with
him
reviled
him
15
33
and
when
the
sixth
hour
was
come
there
was
darkness
over
the
whole
land
until
the
ninth
hour
15
34
and
at
the
ninth
hour
jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
eloi
eloi
lama
sabachthani
which
is
being
interpreted
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
15
35
and
some
of
them
that
stood
by
when
they
heard
it
said
behold
he
calleth
elias
15
36
and
one
ran
and
filled
a
spunge
full
of
vinegar
and
put
it
on
a
reed
and
gave
him
to
drink
saying
let
alone
let
us
see
whether
elias
will
come
to
take
him
down
15
37
and
jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
gave
up
the
ghost
15
38
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
15
39
and
when
the
centurion
which
stood
over
against
him
saw
that
he
so
cried
out
and
gave
up
the
ghost
he
said
truly
this
man
was
the
son
of
god
15
40
there
were
also
women
looking
on
afar
off
among
whom
was
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
the
less
and
of
joses
and
salome
15
41
(who
also
when
he
was
in
galilee
followed
him
and
ministered
unto
him
)
and
many
other
women
which
came
up
with
him
unto
jerusalem
15
42
and
now
when
the
even
was
come
because
it
was
the
preparation
that
is
the
day
before
the
sabbath
15
43
joseph
of
arimathaea
an
honourable
counsellor
which
also
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
god
came
and
went
in
boldly
unto
pilate
and
craved
the
body
of
jesus
15
44
and
pilate
marvelled
if
he
were
already
dead
and
calling
unto
him
the
centurion
he
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
any
while
dead
15
45
and
when
he
knew
it
of
the
centurion
he
gave
the
body
to
joseph
15
46
and
he
bought
fine
linen
and
took
him
down
and
wrapped
him
in
the
linen
and
laid
him
in
a
sepulchre
which
was
hewn
out
of
a
rock
and
rolled
a
stone
unto
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
15
47
and
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
joses
beheld
where
he
was
laid
16
1
and
when
the
sabbath
was
past
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
salome
had
bought
sweet
spices
that
they
might
come
and
anoint
him
16
2
and
very
early
in
the
morning
the
first
day
of
the
week
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
16
3
and
they
said
among
themselves
who
shall
roll
us
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
16
4
and
when
they
looked
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
for
it
was
very
great
16
5
and
entering
into
the
sepulchre
they
saw
a
young
man
sitting
on
the
right
side
clothed
in
a
long
white
garment
and
they
were
affrighted
16
6
and
he
saith
unto
them
be
not
affrighted
ye
seek
jesus
of
nazareth
which
was
crucified
he
is
risen
he
is
not
here
behold
the
place
where
they
laid
him
16
7
but
go
your
way
tell
his
disciples
and
peter
that
he
goeth
before
you
into
galilee
there
shall
ye
see
him
as
he
said
unto
you
16
8
and
they
went
out
quickly
and
fled
from
the
sepulchre
for
they
trembled
and
were
amazed
neither
said
they
any
thing
to
any
man
for
they
were
afraid
16
9
now
when
jesus
was
risen
early
the
first
day
of
the
week
he
appeared
first
to
mary
magdalene
out
of
whom
he
had
cast
seven
devils
16
10
and
she
went
and
told
them
that
had
been
with
him
as
they
mourned
and
wept
16
11
and
they
when
they
had
heard
that
he
was
alive
and
had
been
seen
of
her
believed
not
16
12
after
that
he
appeared
in
another
form
unto
two
of
them
as
they
walked
and
went
into
the
country
16
13
and
they
went
and
told
it
unto
the
residue
neither
believed
they
them
16
14
afterward
he
appeared
unto
the
eleven
as
they
sat
at
meat
and
upbraided
them
with
their
unbelief
and
hardness
of
heart
because
they
believed
not
them
which
had
seen
him
after
he
was
risen
16
15
and
he
said
unto
them
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
16
16
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
16
17
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
16
18
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
16
19
so
then
after
the
lord
had
spoken
unto
them
he
was
received
up
into
heaven
and
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
god
16
20
and
they
went
forth
and
preached
every
where
the
lord
working
with
them
and
confirming
the
word
with
signs
following
amen
the
gospel
according
to
saint
luke
1
1
forasmuch
as
many
have
taken
in
hand
to
set
forth
in
order
a
declaration
of
those
things
which
are
most
surely
believed
among
us
1
2
even
as
they
delivered
them
unto
us
which
from
the
beginning
were
eyewitnesses
and
ministers
of
the
word
1
3
it
seemed
good
to
me
also
having
had
perfect
understanding
of
all
things
from
the
very
first
to
write
unto
thee
in
order
most
excellent
theophilus
1
4
that
thou
mightest
know
the
certainty
of
those
things
wherein
thou
hast
been
instructed
1
5
there
was
in
the
days
of
herod
the
king
of
judaea
a
certain
priest
named
zacharias
of
the
course
of
abia
and
his
wife
was
of
the
daughters
of
aaron
and
her
name
was
elisabeth
1
6
and
they
were
both
righteous
before
god
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of
the
lord
blameless
1
7
and
they
had
no
child
because
that
elisabeth
was
barren
and
they
both
were
now
well
stricken
in
years
1
8
and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
executed
the
priest’s
office
before
god
in
the
order
of
his
course
1
9
according
to
the
custom
of
the
priest’s
office
his
lot
was
to
burn
incense
when
he
went
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
1
10
and
the
whole
multitude
of
the
people
were
praying
without
at
the
time
of
incense
1
11
and
there
appeared
unto
him
an
angel
of
the
lord
standing
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
of
incense
1
12
and
when
zacharias
saw
him
he
was
troubled
and
fear
fell
upon
him
1
13
but
the
angel
said
unto
him
fear
not
zacharias
for
thy
prayer
is
heard
and
thy
wife
elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
john
1
14
and
thou
shalt
have
joy
and
gladness
and
many
shall
rejoice
at
his
birth
1
15
for
he
shall
be
great
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
shall
drink
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink
and
he
shall
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
even
from
his
mother’s
womb
1
16
and
many
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
he
turn
to
the
lord
their
god
1
17
and
he
shall
go
before
him
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
elias
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
disobedient
to
the
wisdom
of
the
just
to
make
ready
a
people
prepared
for
the
lord
1
18
and
zacharias
said
unto
the
angel
whereby
shall
i
know
this
for
i
am
an
old
man
and
my
wife
well
stricken
in
years
1
19
and
the
angel
answering
said
unto
him
i
am
gabriel
that
stand
in
the
presence
of
god
and
am
sent
to
speak
unto
thee
and
to
shew
thee
these
glad
tidings
1
20
and
behold
thou
shalt
be
dumb
and
not
able
to
speak
until
the
day
that
these
things
shall
be
performed
because
thou
believest
not
my
words
which
shall
be
fulfilled
in
their
season
1
21
and
the
people
waited
for
zacharias
and
marvelled
that
he
tarried
so
long
in
the
temple
1
22
and
when
he
came
out
he
could
not
speak
unto
them
and
they
perceived
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
in
the
temple
for
he
beckoned
unto
them
and
remained
speechless
1
23
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
the
days
of
his
ministration
were
accomplished
he
departed
to
his
own
house
1
24
and
after
those
days
his
wife
elisabeth
conceived
and
hid
herself
five
months
saying
1
25
thus
hath
the
lord
dealt
with
me
in
the
days
wherein
he
looked
on
me
to
take
away
my
reproach
among
men
1
26
and
in
the
sixth
month
the
angel
gabriel
was
sent
from
god
unto
a
city
of
galilee
named
nazareth
1
27
to
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
joseph
of
the
house
of
david
and
the
virgin’s
name
was
mary
1
28
and
the
angel
came
in
unto
her
and
said
hail
thou
that
art
highly
favoured
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
1
29
and
when
she
saw
him
she
was
troubled
at
his
saying
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
be
1
30
and
the
angel
said
unto
her
fear
not
mary
for
thou
hast
found
favour
with
god
1
31
and
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb
and
bring
forth
a
son
and
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
1
32
he
shall
be
great
and
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
highest
and
the
lord
god
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
david
1
33
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
for
ever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end
1
34
then
said
mary
unto
the
angel
how
shall
this
be
seeing
i
know
not
a
man
1
35
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
her
the
holy
ghost
shall
come
upon
thee
and
the
power
of
the
highest
shall
overshadow
thee
therefore
also
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
1
36
and
behold
thy
cousin
elisabeth
she
hath
also
conceived
a
son
in
her
old
age
and
this
is
the
sixth
month
with
her
who
was
called
barren
1
37
for
with
god
nothing
shall
be
impossible
1
38
and
mary
said
behold
the
handmaid
of
the
lord
be
it
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
and
the
angel
departed
from
her
1
39
and
mary
arose
in
those
days
and
went
into
the
hill
country
with
haste
into
a
city
of
juda
1
40
and
entered
into
the
house
of
zacharias
and
saluted
elisabeth
1
41
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
elisabeth
heard
the
salutation
of
mary
the
babe
leaped
in
her
womb
and
elisabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
1
42
and
she
spake
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
1
43
and
whence
is
this
to
me
that
the
mother
of
my
lord
should
come
to
me
1
44
for
lo
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
thy
salutation
sounded
in
mine
ears
the
babe
leaped
in
my
womb
for
joy
1
45
and
blessed
is
she
that
believed
for
there
shall
be
a
performance
of
those
things
which
were
told
her
from
the
lord
1
46
and
mary
said
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
1
47
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
saviour
1
48
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden
for
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed
1
49
for
he
that
is
mighty
hath
done
to
me
great
things
and
holy
is
his
name
1
50
and
his
mercy
is
on
them
that
fear
him
from
generation
to
generation
1
51
he
hath
shewed
strength
with
his
arm
he
hath
scattered
the
proud
in
the
imagination
of
their
hearts
1
52
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree
1
53
he
hath
filled
the
hungry
with
good
things
and
the
rich
he
hath
sent
empty
away
1
54
he
hath
holpen
his
servant
israel
in
remembrance
of
his
mercy
1
55
as
he
spake
to
our
fathers
to
abraham
and
to
his
seed
for
ever
1
56
and
mary
abode
with
her
about
three
months
and
returned
to
her
own
house
1
57
now
elisabeth’s
full
time
came
that
she
should
be
delivered
and
she
brought
forth
a
son
1
58
and
her
neighbours
and
her
cousins
heard
how
the
lord
had
shewed
great
mercy
upon
her
and
they
rejoiced
with
her
1
59
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
eighth
day
they
came
to
circumcise
the
child
and
they
called
him
zacharias
after
the
name
of
his
father
1
60
and
his
mother
answered
and
said
not
so
but
he
shall
be
called
john
1
61
and
they
said
unto
her
there
is
none
of
thy
kindred
that
is
called
by
this
name
1
62
and
they
made
signs
to
his
father
how
he
would
have
him
called
1
63
and
he
asked
for
a
writing
table
and
wrote
saying
his
name
is
john
and
they
marvelled
all
1
64
and
his
mouth
was
opened
immediately
and
his
tongue
loosed
and
he
spake
and
praised
god
1
65
and
fear
came
on
all
that
dwelt
round
about
them
and
all
these
sayings
were
noised
abroad
throughout
all
the
hill
country
of
judaea
1
66
and
all
they
that
heard
them
laid
them
up
in
their
hearts
saying
what
manner
of
child
shall
this
be
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
with
him
1
67
and
his
father
zacharias
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
prophesied
saying
1
68
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
for
he
hath
visited
and
redeemed
his
people
1
69
and
hath
raised
up
an
horn
of
salvation
for
us
in
the
house
of
his
servant
david
1
70
as
he
spake
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
which
have
been
since
the
world
began
1
71
that
we
should
be
saved
from
our
enemies
and
from
the
hand
of
all
that
hate
us
1
72
to
perform
the
mercy
promised
to
our
fathers
and
to
remember
his
holy
covenant
1
73
the
oath
which
he
sware
to
our
father
abraham
1
74
that
he
would
grant
unto
us
that
we
being
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
might
serve
him
without
fear
1
75
in
holiness
and
righteousness
before
him
all
the
days
of
our
life
1
76
and
thou
child
shalt
be
called
the
prophet
of
the
highest
for
thou
shalt
go
before
the
face
of
the
lord
to
prepare
his
ways
1
77
to
give
knowledge
of
salvation
unto
his
people
by
the
remission
of
their
sins
1
78
through
the
tender
mercy
of
our
god
whereby
the
dayspring
from
on
high
hath
visited
us
1
79
to
give
light
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
to
guide
our
feet
into
the
way
of
peace
1
80
and
the
child
grew
and
waxed
strong
in
spirit
and
was
in
the
deserts
till
the
day
of
his
shewing
unto
israel
2
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
there
went
out
a
decree
from
caesar
augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
taxed
2
2
(and
this
taxing
was
first
made
when
cyrenius
was
governor
of
syria
)
2
3
and
all
went
to
be
taxed
every
one
into
his
own
city
2
4
and
joseph
also
went
up
from
galilee
out
of
the
city
of
nazareth
into
judaea
unto
the
city
of
david
which
is
called
bethlehem
(because
he
was
of
the
house
and
lineage
of
david
)
2
5
to
be
taxed
with
mary
his
espoused
wife
being
great
with
child
2
6
and
so
it
was
that
while
they
were
there
the
days
were
accomplished
that
she
should
be
delivered
2
7
and
she
brought
forth
her
firstborn
son
and
wrapped
him
in
swaddling
clothes
and
laid
him
in
a
manger
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
inn
2
8
and
there
were
in
the
same
country
shepherds
abiding
in
the
field
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night
2
9
and
lo
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shone
round
about
them
and
they
were
sore
afraid
2
10
and
the
angel
said
unto
them
fear
not
for
behold
i
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy
which
shall
be
to
all
people
2
11
for
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
david
a
saviour
which
is
christ
the
lord
2
12
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
ye
shall
find
the
babe
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
lying
in
a
manger
2
13
and
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
god
and
saying
2
14
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
toward
men
2
15
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
angels
were
gone
away
from
them
into
heaven
the
shepherds
said
one
to
another
let
us
now
go
even
unto
bethlehem
and
see
this
thing
which
is
come
to
pass
which
the
lord
hath
made
known
unto
us
2
16
and
they
came
with
haste
and
found
mary
and
joseph
and
the
babe
lying
in
a
manger
2
17
and
when
they
had
seen
it
they
made
known
abroad
the
saying
which
was
told
them
concerning
this
child
2
18
and
all
they
that
heard
it
wondered
at
those
things
which
were
told
them
by
the
shepherds
2
19
but
mary
kept
all
these
things
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart
2
20
and
the
shepherds
returned
glorifying
and
praising
god
for
all
the
things
that
they
had
heard
and
seen
as
it
was
told
unto
them
2
21
and
when
eight
days
were
accomplished
for
the
circumcising
of
the
child
his
name
was
called
jesus
which
was
so
named
of
the
angel
before
he
was
conceived
in
the
womb
2
22
and
when
the
days
of
her
purification
according
to
the
law
of
moses
were
accomplished
they
brought
him
to
jerusalem
to
present
him
to
the
lord
2
23
(as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
lord
every
male
that
openeth
the
womb
shall
be
called
holy
to
the
lord
)
2
24
and
to
offer
a
sacrifice
according
to
that
which
is
said
in
the
law
of
the
lord
a
pair
of
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
2
25
and
behold
there
was
a
man
in
jerusalem
whose
name
was
simeon
and
the
same
man
was
just
and
devout
waiting
for
the
consolation
of
israel
and
the
holy
ghost
was
upon
him
2
26
and
it
was
revealed
unto
him
by
the
holy
ghost
that
he
should
not
see
death
before
he
had
seen
the
lord’s
christ
2
27
and
he
came
by
the
spirit
into
the
temple
and
when
the
parents
brought
in
the
child
jesus
to
do
for
him
after
the
custom
of
the
law
2
28
then
took
he
him
up
in
his
arms
and
blessed
god
and
said
2
29
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
according
to
thy
word
2
30
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation
2
31
which
thou
hast
prepared
before
the
face
of
all
people
2
32
a
light
to
lighten
the
gentiles
and
the
glory
of
thy
people
israel
2
33
and
joseph
and
his
mother
marvelled
at
those
things
which
were
spoken
of
him
2
34
and
simeon
blessed
them
and
said
unto
mary
his
mother
behold
this
child
is
set
for
the
fall
and
rising
again
of
many
in
israel
and
for
a
sign
which
shall
be
spoken
against
2
35
(yea
a
sword
shall
pierce
through
thy
own
soul
also
)
that
the
thoughts
of
many
hearts
may
be
revealed
2
36
and
there
was
one
anna
a
prophetess
the
daughter
of
phanuel
of
the
tribe
of
aser
she
was
of
a
great
age
and
had
lived
with
an
husband
seven
years
from
her
virginity
2
37
and
she
was
a
widow
of
about
fourscore
and
four
years
which
departed
not
from
the
temple
but
served
god
with
fastings
and
prayers
night
and
day
2
38
and
she
coming
in
that
instant
gave
thanks
likewise
unto
the
lord
and
spake
of
him
to
all
them
that
looked
for
redemption
in
jerusalem
2
39
and
when
they
had
performed
all
things
according
to
the
law
of
the
lord
they
returned
into
galilee
to
their
own
city
nazareth
2
40
and
the
child
grew
and
waxed
strong
in
spirit
filled
with
wisdom
and
the
grace
of
god
was
upon
him
2
41
now
his
parents
went
to
jerusalem
every
year
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
2
42
and
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
they
went
up
to
jerusalem
after
the
custom
of
the
feast
2
43
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
the
days
as
they
returned
the
child
jesus
tarried
behind
in
jerusalem
and
joseph
and
his
mother
knew
not
of
it
2
44
but
they
supposing
him
to
have
been
in
the
company
went
a
day’s
journey
and
they
sought
him
among
their
kinsfolk
and
acquaintance
2
45
and
when
they
found
him
not
they
turned
back
again
to
jerusalem
seeking
him
2
46
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
days
they
found
him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
doctors
both
hearing
them
and
asking
them
questions
2
47
and
all
that
heard
him
were
astonished
at
his
understanding
and
answers
2
48
and
when
they
saw
him
they
were
amazed
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
son
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
us
behold
thy
father
and
i
have
sought
thee
sorrowing
2
49
and
he
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
sought
me
wist
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
father’s
business
2
50
and
they
understood
not
the
saying
which
he
spake
unto
them
2
51
and
he
went
down
with
them
and
came
to
nazareth
and
was
subject
unto
them
but
his
mother
kept
all
these
sayings
in
her
heart
2
52
and
jesus
increased
in
wisdom
and
stature
and
in
favour
with
god
and
man
3
1
now
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
tiberius
caesar
pontius
pilate
being
governor
of
judaea
and
herod
being
tetrarch
of
galilee
and
his
brother
philip
tetrarch
of
ituraea
and
of
the
region
of
trachonitis
and
lysanias
the
tetrarch
of
abilene
3
2
annas
and
caiaphas
being
the
high
priests
the
word
of
god
came
unto
john
the
son
of
zacharias
in
the
wilderness
3
3
and
he
came
into
all
the
country
about
jordan
preaching
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
3
4
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
words
of
esaias
the
prophet
saying
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
straight
3
5
every
valley
shall
be
filled
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
brought
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
ways
shall
be
made
smooth
3
6
and
all
flesh
shall
see
the
salvation
of
god
3
7
then
said
he
to
the
multitude
that
came
forth
to
be
baptized
of
him
o
generation
of
vipers
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
3
8
bring
forth
therefore
fruits
worthy
of
repentance
and
begin
not
to
say
within
yourselves
we
have
abraham
to
our
father
for
i
say
unto
you
that
god
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
abraham
3
9
and
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees
every
tree
therefore
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
3
10
and
the
people
asked
him
saying
what
shall
we
do
then
3
11
he
answereth
and
saith
unto
them
he
that
hath
two
coats
let
him
impart
to
him
that
hath
none
and
he
that
hath
meat
let
him
do
likewise
3
12
then
came
also
publicans
to
be
baptized
and
said
unto
him
master
what
shall
we
do
3
13
and
he
said
unto
them
exact
no
more
than
that
which
is
appointed
you
3
14
and
the
soldiers
likewise
demanded
of
him
saying
and
what
shall
we
do
and
he
said
unto
them
do
violence
to
no
man
neither
accuse
any
falsely
and
be
content
with
your
wages
3
15
and
as
the
people
were
in
expectation
and
all
men
mused
in
their
hearts
of
john
whether
he
were
the
christ
or
not
3
16
john
answered
saying
unto
them
all
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
but
one
mightier
than
i
cometh
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
3
17
whose
fan
is
in
his
hand
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor
and
will
gather
the
wheat
into
his
garner
but
the
chaff
he
will
burn
with
fire
unquenchable
3
18
and
many
other
things
in
his
exhortation
preached
he
unto
the
people
3
19
but
herod
the
tetrarch
being
reproved
by
him
for
herodias
his
brother
philip’s
wife
and
for
all
the
evils
which
herod
had
done
3
20
added
yet
this
above
all
that
he
shut
up
john
in
prison
3
21
now
when
all
the
people
were
baptized
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
also
being
baptized
and
praying
the
heaven
was
opened
3
22
and
the
holy
ghost
descended
in
a
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
upon
him
and
a
voice
came
from
heaven
which
said
thou
art
my
beloved
son
in
thee
i
am
well
pleased
3
23
and
jesus
himself
began
to
be
about
thirty
years
of
age
being
(as
was
supposed)
the
son
of
joseph
which
was

being
full
of

ghost
returned
from

and
was
led
by
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
4
2
being
forty
days
tempted
of
the
devil
and
in
those
days
he
did
eat
nothing
and
when
they
were
ended
he
afterward
hungered
4
3
and
the
devil
said
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
this
stone
that
it
be
made
bread
4
4
and
jesus
answered
him
saying
it
is
written
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
of
god
4
5
and
the
devil
taking
him
up
into
an
high
mountain
shewed
unto
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
in
a
moment
of
time
4
6
and
the
devil
said
unto
him
all
this
power
will
i
give
thee
and
the
glory
of
them
for
that
is
delivered
unto
me
and
to
whomsoever
i
will
i
give
it
4
7
if
thou
therefore
wilt
worship
me
all
shall
be
thine
4
8
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
get
thee
behind
me
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
4
9
and
he
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
set
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
said
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
cast
thyself
down
from
hence
4
10
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
4
11
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
4
12
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
it
is
said
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
4
13
and
when
the
devil
had
ended
all
the
temptation
he
departed
from
him
for
a
season
4
14
and
jesus
returned
in
the
power
of
the
spirit
into
galilee
and
there
went
out
a
fame
of
him
through
all
the
region
round
about
4
15
and
he
taught
in
their
synagogues
being
glorified
of
all
4
16
and
he
came
to
nazareth
where
he
had
been
brought
up
and
as
his
custom
was
he
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day
and
stood
up
for
to
read
4
17
and
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
of
the
prophet
esaias
and
when
he
had
opened
the
book
he
found
the
place
where
it
was
written
4
18
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
brokenhearted
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
4
19
to
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
4
20
and
he
closed
the
book
and
he
gave
it
again
to
the
minister
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
of
all
them
that
were
in
the
synagogue
were
fastened
on
him
4
21
and
he
began
to
say
unto
them
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
4
22
and
all
bare
him
witness
and
wondered
at
the
gracious
words
which
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
and
they
said
is
not
this
joseph’s
son
4
23
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
will
surely
say
unto
me
this
proverb
physician
heal
thyself
whatsoever
we
have
heard
done
in
capernaum
do
also
here
in
thy
country
4
24
and
he
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
no
prophet
is
accepted
in
his
own
country
4
25
but
i
tell
you
of
a
truth
many
widows
were
in
israel
in
the
days
of
elias
when
the
heaven
was
shut
up
three
years
and
six
months
when
great
famine
was
throughout
all
the
land
4
26
but
unto
none
of
them
was
elias
sent
save
unto
sarepta
a
city
of
sidon
unto
a
woman
that
was
a
widow
4
27
and
many
lepers
were
in
israel
in
the
time
of
eliseus
the
prophet
and
none
of
them
was
cleansed
saving
naaman
the
syrian
4
28
and
all
they
in
the
synagogue
when
they
heard
these
things
were
filled
with
wrath
4
29
and
rose
up
and
thrust
him
out
of
the
city
and
led
him
unto
the
brow
of
the
hill
whereon
their
city
was
built
that
they
might
cast
him
down
headlong
4
30
but
he
passing
through
the
midst
of
them
went
his
way
4
31
and
came
down
to
capernaum
a
city
of
galilee
and
taught
them
on
the
sabbath
days
4
32
and
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
for
his
word
was
with
power
4
33
and
in
the
synagogue
there
was
a
man
which
had
a
spirit
of
an
unclean
devil
and
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
4
34
saying
let
us
alone
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee
thou
jesus
of
nazareth
art
thou
come
to
destroy
us
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
holy
one
of
god
4
35
and
jesus
rebuked
him
saying
hold
thy
peace
and
come
out
of
him
and
when
the
devil
had
thrown
him
in
the
midst
he
came
out
of
him
and
hurt
him
not
4
36
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
spake
among
themselves
saying
what
a
word
is
this
for
with
authority
and
power
he
commandeth
the
unclean
spirits
and
they
come
out
4
37
and
the
fame
of
him
went
out
into
every
place
of
the
country
round
about
4
38
and
he
arose
out
of
the
synagogue
and
entered
into
simon’s
house
and
simon’s
wife’s
mother
was
taken
with
a
great
fever
and
they
besought
him
for
her
4
39
and
he
stood
over
her
and
rebuked
the
fever
and
it
left
her
and
immediately
she
arose
and
ministered
unto
them
4
40
now
when
the
sun
was
setting
all
they
that
had
any
sick
with
divers
diseases
brought
them
unto
him
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
every
one
of
them
and
healed
them
4
41
and
devils
also
came
out
of
many
crying
out
and
saying
thou
art
christ
the
son
of
god
and
he
rebuking
them
suffered
them
not
to
speak
for
they
knew
that
he
was
christ
4
42
and
when
it
was
day
he
departed
and
went
into
a
desert
place
and
the
people
sought
him
and
came
unto
him
and
stayed
him
that
he
should
not
depart
from
them
4
43
and
he
said
unto
them
i
must
preach
the
kingdom
of
god
to
other
cities
also
for
therefore
am
i
sent
4
44
and
he
preached
in
the
synagogues
of
galilee
5
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
the
people
pressed
upon
him
to
hear
the
word
of
god
he
stood
by
the
lake
of
gennesaret
5
2
and
saw
two
ships
standing
by
the
lake
but
the
fishermen
were
gone
out
of
them
and
were
washing
their
nets
5
3
and
he
entered
into
one
of
the
ships
which
was
simon’s
and
prayed
him
that
he
would
thrust
out
a
little
from
the
land
and
he
sat
down
and
taught
the
people
out
of
the
ship
5
4
now
when
he
had
left
speaking
he
said
unto
simon
launch
out
into
the
deep
and
let
down
your
nets
for
a
draught
5
5
and
simon
answering
said
unto
him
master
we
have
toiled
all
the
night
and
have
taken
nothing
nevertheless
at
thy
word
i
will
let
down
the
net
5
6
and
when
they
had
this
done
they
inclosed
a
great
multitude
of
fishes
and
their
net
brake
5
7
and
they
beckoned
unto
their
partners
which
were
in
the
other
ship
that
they
should
come
and
help
them
and
they
came
and
filled
both
the
ships
so
that
they
began
to
sink
5
8
when
simon
peter
saw
it
he
fell
down
at
jesus’
knees
saying
depart
from
me
for
i
am
a
sinful
man
o
lord
5
9
for
he
was
astonished
and
all
that
were
with
him
at
the
draught
of
the
fishes
which
they
had
taken
5
10
and
so
was
also
james
and
john
the
sons
of
zebedee
which
were
partners
with
simon
and
jesus
said
unto
simon
fear
not
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
catch
men
5
11
and
when
they
had
brought
their
ships
to
land
they
forsook
all
and
followed
him
5
12
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
in
a
certain
city
behold
a
man
full
of
leprosy
who
seeing
jesus
fell
on
his
face
and
besought
him
saying
lord
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
me
clean
5
13
and
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
i
will
be
thou
clean
and
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
5
14
and
he
charged
him
to
tell
no
man
but
go
and
shew
thyself
to
the
priest
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
according
as
moses
commanded
for
a
testimony
unto
them
5
15
but
so
much
the
more
went
there
a
fame
abroad
of
him
and
great
multitudes
came
together
to
hear
and
to
be
healed
by
him
of
their
infirmities
5
16
and
he
withdrew
himself
into
the
wilderness
and
prayed
5
17
and
it
came
to
pass
on
a
certain
day
as
he
was
teaching
that
there
were
pharisees
and
doctors
of
the
law
sitting
by
which
were
come
out
of
every
town
of
galilee
and
judaea
and
jerusalem
and
the
power
of
the
lord
was
present
to
heal
them
5
18
and
behold
men
brought
in
a
bed
a
man
which
was
taken
with
a
palsy
and
they
sought
means
to
bring
him
in
and
to
lay
him
before
him
5
19
and
when
they
could
not
find
by
what
way
they
might
bring
him
in
because
of
the
multitude
they
went
upon
the
housetop
and
let
him
down
through
the
tiling
with
his
couch
into
the
midst
before
jesus
5
20
and
when
he
saw
their
faith
he
said
unto
him
man
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
5
21
and
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
began
to
reason
saying
who
is
this
which
speaketh
blasphemies
who
can
forgive
sins
but
god
alone
5
22
but
when
jesus
perceived
their
thoughts
he
answering
said
unto
them
what
reason
ye
in
your
hearts
5
23
whether
is
easier
to
say
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
or
to
say
rise
up
and
walk
5
24
but
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
upon
earth
to
forgive
sins
(he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
palsy
)
i
say
unto
thee
arise
and
take
up
thy
couch
and
go
into
thine
house
5
25
and
immediately
he
rose
up
before
them
and
took
up
that
whereon
he
lay
and
departed
to
his
own
house
glorifying
god
5
26
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
they
glorified
god
and
were
filled
with
fear
saying
we
have
seen
strange
things
to
day
5
27
and
after
these
things
he
went
forth
and
saw
a
publican
named
levi
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
custom
and
he
said
unto
him
follow
me
5
28
and
he
left
all
rose
up
and
followed
him
5
29
and
levi
made
him
a
great
feast
in
his
own
house
and
there
was
a
great
company
of
publicans
and
of
others
that
sat
down
with
them
5
30
but
their
scribes
and
pharisees
murmured
against
his
disciples
saying
why
do
ye
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
5
31
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
they
that
are
whole
need
not
a
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
5
32
i
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
5
33
and
they
said
unto
him
why
do
the
disciples
of
john
fast
often
and
make
prayers
and
likewise
the
disciples
of
the
pharisees
but
thine
eat
and
drink
5
34
and
he
said
unto
them
can
ye
make
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
fast
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
5
35
but
the
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
them
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
days
5
36
and
he
spake
also
a
parable
unto
them
no
man
putteth
a
piece
of
a
new
garment
upon
an
old
if
otherwise
then
both
the
new
maketh
a
rent
and
the
piece
that
was
taken
out
of
the
new
agreeth
not
with
the
old
5
37
and
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
bottles
else
the
new
wine
will
burst
the
bottles
and
be
spilled
and
the
bottles
shall
perish
5
38
but
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
bottles
and
both
are
preserved
5
39
no
man
also
having
drunk
old
wine
straightway
desireth
new
for
he
saith
the
old
is
better
6
1
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
second
sabbath
after
the
first
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields
and
his
disciples
plucked
the
ears
of
corn
and
did
eat
rubbing
them
in
their
hands
6
2
and
certain
of
the
pharisees
said
unto
them
why
do
ye
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
on
the
sabbath
days
6
3
and
jesus
answering
them
said
have
ye
not
read
so
much
as
this
what
david
did
when
himself
was
an
hungred
and
they
which
were
with
him
6
4
how
he
went
into
the
house
of
god
and
did
take
and
eat
the
shewbread
and
gave
also
to
them
that
were
with
him
which
it
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
priests
alone
6
5
and
he
said
unto
them
that
the
son
of
man
is
lord
also
of
the
sabbath
6
6
and
it
came
to
pass
also
on
another
sabbath
that
he
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there
was
a
man
whose
right
hand
was
withered
6
7
and
the
scribes
and
pharisees
watched
him
whether
he
would
heal
on
the
sabbath
day
that
they
might
find
an
accusation
against
him
6
8
but
he
knew
their
thoughts
and
said
to
the
man
which
had
the
withered
hand
rise
up
and
stand
forth
in
the
midst
and
he
arose
and
stood
forth
6
9
then
said
jesus
unto
them
i
will
ask
you
one
thing
is
it
lawful
on
the
sabbath
days
to
do
good
or
to
do
evil
to
save
life
or
to
destroy
it
6
10
and
looking
round
about
upon
them
all
he
said
unto
the
man
stretch
forth
thy
hand
and
he
did
so
and
his
hand
was
restored
whole
as
the
other
6
11
and
they
were
filled
with
madness
and
communed
one
with
another
what
they
might
do
to
jesus
6
12
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
he
went
out
into
a
mountain
to
pray
and
continued
all
night
in
prayer
to
god
6
13
and
when
it
was
day
he
called
unto
him
his
disciples
and
of
them
he
chose
twelve
whom
also
he
named
apostles
6
14
simon
(whom
he
also
named
peter
)
and
andrew
his
brother
james
and
john
philip
and
bartholomew
6
15
matthew
and
thomas
james
the
son
of
alphaeus
and
simon
called
zelotes
6
16
and
judas
the
brother
of
james
and
judas
iscariot
which
also
was
the
traitor
6
17
and
he
came
down
with
them
and
stood
in
the
plain
and
the
company
of
his
disciples
and
a
great
multitude
of
people
out
of
all
judaea
and
jerusalem
and
from
the
sea
coast
of
tyre
and
sidon
which
came
to
hear
him
and
to
be
healed
of
their
diseases
6
18
and
they
that
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits
and
they
were
healed
6
19
and
the
whole
multitude
sought
to
touch
him
for
there
went
virtue
out
of
him
and
healed
them
all
6
20
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
on
his
disciples
and
said
blessed
be
ye
poor
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
of
god
6
21
blessed
are
ye
that
hunger
now
for
ye
shall
be
filled
blessed
are
ye
that
weep
now
for
ye
shall
laugh
6
22
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
hate
you
and
when
they
shall
separate
you
from
their
company
and
shall
reproach
you
and
cast
out
your
name
as
evil
for
the
son
of
man’s
sake
6
23
rejoice
ye
in
that
day
and
leap
for
joy
for
behold
your
reward
is
great
in
heaven
for
in
the
like
manner
did
their
fathers
unto
the
prophets
6
24
but
woe
unto
you
that
are
rich
for
ye
have
received
your
consolation
6
25
woe
unto
you
that
are
full
for
ye
shall
hunger
woe
unto
you
that
laugh
now
for
ye
shall
mourn
and
weep
6
26
woe
unto
you
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
of
you
for
so
did
their
fathers
to
the
false
prophets
6
27
but
i
say
unto
you
which
hear
love
your
enemies
do
good
to
them
which
hate
you
6
28
bless
them
that
curse
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
6
29
and
unto
him
that
smiteth
thee
on
the
one
cheek
offer
also
the
other
and
him
that
taketh
away
thy
cloak
forbid
not
to
take
thy
coat
also
6
30
give
to
every
man
that
asketh
of
thee
and
of
him
that
taketh
away
thy
goods
ask
them
not
again
6
31
and
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
also
to
them
likewise
6
32
for
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you
what
thank
have
ye
for
sinners
also
love
those
that
love
them
6
33
and
if
ye
do
good
to
them
which
do
good
to
you
what
thank
have
ye
for
sinners
also
do
even
the
same
6
34
and
if
ye
lend
to
them
of
whom
ye
hope
to
receive
what
thank
have
ye
for
sinners
also
lend
to
sinners
to
receive
as
much
again
6
35
but
love
ye
your
enemies
and
do
good
and
lend
hoping
for
nothing
again
and
your
reward
shall
be
great
and
ye
shall
be
the
children
of
the
highest
for
he
is
kind
unto
the
unthankful
and
to
the
evil
6
36
be
ye
therefore
merciful
as
your
father
also
is
merciful
6
37
judge
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
judged
condemn
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
condemned
forgive
and
ye
shall
be
forgiven
6
38
give
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
good
measure
pressed
down
and
shaken
together
and
running
over
shall
men
give
into
your
bosom
for
with
the
same
measure
that
ye
mete
withal
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
6
39
and
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
can
the
blind
lead
the
blind
shall
they
not
both
fall
into
the
ditch
6
40
the
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
but
every
one
that
is
perfect
shall
be
as
his
master
6
41
and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother’s
eye
but
perceivest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
6
42
either
how
canst
thou
say
to
thy
brother
brother
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
that
is
in
thine
eye
when
thou
thyself
beholdest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
thou
hypocrite
cast
out
first
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
pull
out
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother’s
eye
6
43
for
a
good
tree
bringeth
not
forth
corrupt
fruit
neither
doth
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit
6
44
for
every
tree
is
known
by
his
own
fruit
for
of
thorns
men
do
not
gather
figs
nor
of
a
bramble
bush
gather
they
grapes
6
45
a
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
his
heart
bringeth
forth
that
which
is
good
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
of
his
heart
bringeth
forth
that
which
is
evil
for
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
his
mouth
speaketh
6
46
and
why
call
ye
me
lord
lord
and
do
not
the
things
which
i
say
6
47
whosoever
cometh
to
me
and
heareth
my
sayings
and
doeth
them
i
will
shew
you
to
whom
he
is
like
6
48
he
is
like
a
man
which
built
an
house
and
digged
deep
and
laid
the
foundation
on
a
rock
and
when
the
flood
arose
the
stream
beat
vehemently
upon
that
house
and
could
not
shake
it
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock
6
49
but
he
that
heareth
and
doeth
not
is
like
a
man
that
without
a
foundation
built
an
house
upon
the
earth
against
which
the
stream
did
beat
vehemently
and
immediately
it
fell
and
the
ruin
of
that
house
was
great
7
1
now
when
he
had
ended
all
his
sayings
in
the
audience
of
the
people
he
entered
into
capernaum
7
2
and
a
certain
centurion’s
servant
who
was
dear
unto
him
was
sick
and
ready
to
die
7
3
and
when
he
heard
of
jesus
he
sent
unto
him
the
elders
of
the
jews
beseeching
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
servant
7
4
and
when
they
came
to
jesus
they
besought
him
instantly
saying
that
he
was
worthy
for
whom
he
should
do
this
7
5
for
he
loveth
our
nation
and
he
hath
built
us
a
synagogue
7
6
then
jesus
went
with
them
and
when
he
was
now
not
far
from
the
house
the
centurion
sent
friends
to
him
saying
unto
him
lord
trouble
not
thyself
for
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
enter
under
my
roof
7
7
wherefore
neither
thought
i
myself
worthy
to
come
unto
thee
but
say
in
a
word
and
my
servant
shall
be
healed
7
8
for
i
also
am
a
man
set
under
authority
having
under
me
soldiers
and
i
say
unto
one
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
another
come
and
he
cometh
and
to
my
servant
do
this
and
he
doeth
it
7
9
when
jesus
heard
these
things
he
marvelled
at
him
and
turned
him
about
and
said
unto
the
people
that
followed
him
i
say
unto
you
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
israel
7
10
and
they
that
were
sent
returning
to
the
house
found
the
servant
whole
that
had
been
sick
7
11
and
it
came
to
pass
the
day
after
that
he
went
into
a
city
called
nain
and
many
of
his
disciples
went
with
him
and
much
people
7
12
now
when
he
came
nigh
to
the
gate
of
the
city
behold
there
was
a
dead
man
carried
out
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
was
a
widow
and
much
people
of
the
city
was
with
her
7
13
and
when
the
lord
saw
her
he
had
compassion
on
her
and
said
unto
her
weep
not
7
14
and
he
came
and
touched
the
bier
and
they
that
bare
him
stood
still
and
he
said
young
man
i
say
unto
thee
arise
7
15
and
he
that
was
dead
sat
up
and
began
to
speak
and
he
delivered
him
to
his
mother
7
16
and
there
came
a
fear
on
all
and
they
glorified
god
saying
that
a
great
prophet
is
risen
up
among
us
and
that
god
hath
visited
his
people
7
17
and
this
rumour
of
him
went
forth
throughout
all
judaea
and
throughout
all
the
region
round
about
7
18
and
the
disciples
of
john
shewed
him
of
all
these
things
7
19
and
john
calling
unto
him
two
of
his
disciples
sent
them
to
jesus
saying
art
thou
he
that
should
come
or
look
we
for
another
7
20
when
the
men
were
come
unto
him
they
said
john
baptist
hath
sent
us
unto
thee
saying
art
thou
he
that
should
come
or
look
we
for
another
7
21
and
in
that
same
hour
he
cured
many
of
their
infirmities
and
plagues
and
of
evil
spirits
and
unto
many
that
were
blind
he
gave
sight
7
22
then
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
go
your
way
and
tell
john
what
things
ye
have
seen
and
heard
how
that
the
blind
see
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
preached
7
23
and
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
7
24
and
when
the
messengers
of
john
were
departed
he
began
to
speak
unto
the
people
concerning
john
what
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
for
to
see
a
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
7
25
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
man
clothed
in
soft
raiment
behold
they
which
are
gorgeously
apparelled
and
live
delicately
are
in
kings’
courts
7
26
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
prophet
yea
i
say
unto
you
and
much
more
than
a
prophet
7
27
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
behold
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
7
28
for
i
say
unto
you
among
those
that
are
born
of
women
there
is
not
a
greater
prophet
than
john
the
baptist
but
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
god
is
greater
than
he
7
29
and
all
the
people
that
heard
him
and
the
publicans
justified
god
being
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
john
7
30
but
the
pharisees
and
lawyers
rejected
the
counsel
of
god
against
themselves
being
not
baptized
of
him
7
31
and
the
lord
said
whereunto
then
shall
i
liken
the
men
of
this
generation
and
to
what
are
they
like
7
32
they
are
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
marketplace
and
calling
one
to
another
and
saying
we
have
piped
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
danced
we
have
mourned
to
you
and
ye
have
not
wept
7
33
for
john
the
baptist
came
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
ye
say
he
hath
a
devil
7
34
the
son
of
man
is
come
eating
and
drinking
and
ye
say
behold
a
gluttonous
man
and
a
winebibber
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
7
35
but
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
children
7
36
and
one
of
the
pharisees
desired
him
that
he
would
eat
with
him
and
he
went
into
the
pharisee’s
house
and
sat
down
to
meat
7
37
and
behold
a
woman
in
the
city
which
was
a
sinner
when
she
knew
that
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
pharisee’s
house
brought
an
alabaster
box
of
ointment
7
38
and
stood
at
his
feet
behind
him
weeping
and
began
to
wash
his
feet
with
tears
and
did
wipe
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head
and
kissed
his
feet
and
anointed
them
with
the
ointment
7
39
now
when
the
pharisee
which
had
bidden
him
saw
it
he
spake
within
himself
saying
this
man
if
he
were
a
prophet
would
have
known
who
and
what
manner
of
woman
this
is
that
toucheth
him
for
she
is
a
sinner
7
40
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
simon
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
thee
and
he
saith
master
say
on
7
41
there
was
a
certain
creditor
which
had
two
debtors
the
one
owed
five
hundred
pence
and
the
other
fifty
7
42
and
when
they
had
nothing
to
pay
he
frankly
forgave
them
both
tell
me
therefore
which
of
them
will
love
him
most
7
43
simon
answered
and
said
i
suppose
that
he
to
whom
he
forgave
most
and
he
said
unto
him
thou
hast
rightly
judged
7
44
and
he
turned
to
the
woman
and
said
unto
simon
seest
thou
this
woman
i
entered
into
thine
house
thou
gavest
me
no
water
for
my
feet
but
she
hath
washed
my
feet
with
tears
and
wiped
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head
7
45
thou
gavest
me
no
kiss
but
this
woman
since
the
time
i
came
in
hath
not
ceased
to
kiss
my
feet
7
46
my
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
anoint
but
this
woman
hath
anointed
my
feet
with
ointment
7
47
wherefore
i
say
unto
thee
her
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
for
she
loved
much
but
to
whom
little
is
forgiven
the
same
loveth
little
7
48
and
he
said
unto
her
thy
sins
are
forgiven
7
49
and
they
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
began
to
say
within
themselves
who
is
this
that
forgiveth
sins
also
7
50
and
he
said
to
the
woman
thy
faith
hath
saved
thee
go
in
peace
8
1
and
it
came
to
pass
afterward
that
he
went
throughout
every
city
and
village
preaching
and
shewing
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
twelve
were
with
him
8
2
and
certain
women
which
had
been
healed
of
evil
spirits
and
infirmities
mary
called
magdalene
out
of
whom
went
seven
devils
8
3
and
joanna
the
wife
of
chuza
herod’s
steward
and
susanna
and
many
others
which
ministered
unto
him
of
their
substance
8
4
and
when
much
people
were
gathered
together
and
were
come
to
him
out
of
every
city
he
spake
by
a
parable
8
5
a
sower
went
out
to
sow
his
seed
and
as
he
sowed
some
fell
by
the
way
side
and
it
was
trodden
down
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
devoured
it
8
6
and
some
fell
upon
a
rock
and
as
soon
as
it
was
sprung
up
it
withered
away
because
it
lacked
moisture
8
7
and
some
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
sprang
up
with
it
and
choked
it
8
8
and
other
fell
on
good
ground
and
sprang
up
and
bare
fruit
an
hundredfold
and
when
he
had
said
these
things
he
cried
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
8
9
and
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
what
might
this
parable
be
8
10
and
he
said
unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
god
but
to
others
in
parables
that
seeing
they
might
not
see
and
hearing
they
might
not
understand
8
11
now
the
parable
is
this
the
seed
is
the
word
of
god
8
12
those
by
the
way
side
are
they
that
hear
then
cometh
the
devil
and
taketh
away
the
word
out
of
their
hearts
lest
they
should
believe
and
be
saved
8
13
they
on
the
rock
are
they
which
when
they
hear
receive
the
word
with
joy
and
these
have
no
root
which
for
a
while
believe
and
in
time
of
temptation
fall
away
8
14
and
that
which
fell
among
thorns
are
they
which
when
they
have
heard
go
forth
and
are
choked
with
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
of
this
life
and
bring
no
fruit
to
perfection
8
15
but
that
on
the
good
ground
are
they
which
in
an
honest
and
good
heart
having
heard
the
word
keep
it
and
bring
forth
fruit
with
patience
8
16
no
man
when
he
hath
lighted
a
candle
covereth
it
with
a
vessel
or
putteth
it
under
a
bed
but
setteth
it
on
a
candlestick
that
they
which
enter
in
may
see
the
light
8
17
for
nothing
is
secret
that
shall
not
be
made
manifest
neither
any
thing
hid
that
shall
not
be
known
and
come
abroad
8
18
take
heed
therefore
how
ye
hear
for
whosoever
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
seemeth
to
have
8
19
then
came
to
him
his
mother
and
his
brethren
and
could
not
come
at
him
for
the
press
8
20
and
it
was
told
him
by
certain
which
said
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
to
see
thee
8
21
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
my
mother
and
my
brethren
are
these
which
hear
the
word
of
god
and
do
it
8
22
now
it
came
to
pass
on
a
certain
day
that
he
went
into
a
ship
with
his
disciples
and
he
said
unto
them
let
us
go
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
they
launched
forth
8
23
but
as
they
sailed
he
fell
asleep
and
there
came
down
a
storm
of
wind
on
the
lake
and
they
were
filled
with
water
and
were
in
jeopardy
8
24
and
they
came
to
him
and
awoke
him
saying
master
master
we
perish
then
he
arose
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
of
the
water
and
they
ceased
and
there
was
a
calm
8
25
and
he
said
unto
them
where
is
your
faith
and
they
being
afraid
wondered
saying
one
to
another
what
manner
of
man
is
this
for
he
commandeth
even
the
winds
and
water
and
they
obey
him
8
26
and
they
arrived
at
the
country
of
the
gadarenes
which
is
over
against
galilee
8
27
and
when
he
went
forth
to
land
there
met
him
out
of
the
city
a
certain
man
which
had
devils
long
time
and
ware
no
clothes
neither
abode
in
any
house
but
in
the
tombs
8
28
when
he
saw
jesus
he
cried
out
and
fell
down
before
him
and
with
a
loud
voice
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
jesus
thou
son
of
god
most
high
i
beseech
thee
torment
me
not
8
29
(for
he
had
commanded
the
unclean
spirit
to
come
out
of
the
man
for
oftentimes
it
had
caught
him
and
he
was
kept
bound
with
chains
and
in
fetters
and
he
brake
the
bands
and
was
driven
of
the
devil
into
the
wilderness
)
8
30
and
jesus
asked
him
saying
what
is
thy
name
and
he
said
legion
because
many
devils
were
entered
into
him
8
31
and
they
besought
him
that
he
would
not
command
them
to
go
out
into
the
deep
8
32
and
there
was
there
an
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
on
the
mountain
and
they
besought
him
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
enter
into
them
and
he
suffered
them
8
33
then
went
the
devils
out
of
the
man
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
lake
and
were
choked
8
34
when
they
that
fed
them
saw
what
was
done
they
fled
and
went
and
told
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
country
8
35
then
they
went
out
to
see
what
was
done
and
came
to
jesus
and
found
the
man
out
of
whom
the
devils
were
departed
sitting
at
the
feet
of
jesus
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
and
they
were
afraid
8
36
they
also
which
saw
it
told
them
by
what
means
he
that
was
possessed
of
the
devils
was
healed
8
37
then
the
whole
multitude
of
the
country
of
the
gadarenes
round
about
besought
him
to
depart
from
them
for
they
were
taken
with
great
fear
and
he
went
up
into
the
ship
and
returned
back
again
8
38
now
the
man
out
of
whom
the
devils
were
departed
besought
him
that
he
might
be
with
him
but
jesus
sent
him
away
saying
8
39
return
to
thine
own
house
and
shew
how
great
things
god
hath
done
unto
thee
and
he
went
his
way
and
published
throughout
the
whole
city
how
great
things
jesus
had
done
unto
him
8
40
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
was
returned
the
people
gladly
received
him
for
they
were
all
waiting
for
him
8
41
and
behold
there
came
a
man
named
jairus
and
he
was
a
ruler
of
the
synagogue
and
he
fell
down
at
jesus’
feet
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
into
his
house
8
42
for
he
had
one
only
daughter
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
she
lay
a
dying
but
as
he
went
the
people
thronged
him
8
43
and
a
woman
having
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
years
which
had
spent
all
her
living
upon
physicians
neither
could
be
healed
of
any
8
44
came
behind
him
and
touched
the
border
of
his
garment
and
immediately
her
issue
of
blood
stanched
8
45
and
jesus
said
who
touched
me
when
all
denied
peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
said
master
the
multitude
throng
thee
and
press
thee
and
sayest
thou
who
touched
me
8
46
and
jesus
said
somebody
hath
touched
me
for
i
perceive
that
virtue
is
gone
out
of
me
8
47
and
when
the
woman
saw
that
she
was
not
hid
she
came
trembling
and
falling
down
before
him
she
declared
unto
him
before
all
the
people
for
what
cause
she
had
touched
him
and
how
she
was
healed
immediately
8
48
and
he
said
unto
her
daughter
be
of
good
comfort
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
go
in
peace
8
49
while
he
yet
spake
there
cometh
one
from
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue’s
house
saying
to
him
thy
daughter
is
dead
trouble
not
the
master
8
50
but
when
jesus
heard
it
he
answered
him
saying
fear
not
believe
only
and
she
shall
be
made
whole
8
51
and
when
he
came
into
the
house
he
suffered
no
man
to
go
in
save
peter
and
james
and
john
and
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
maiden
8
52
and
all
wept
and
bewailed
her
but
he
said
weep
not
she
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
8
53
and
they
laughed
him
to
scorn
knowing
that
she
was
dead
8
54
and
he
put
them
all
out
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
called
saying
maid
arise
8
55
and
her
spirit
came
again
and
she
arose
straightway
and
he
commanded
to
give
her
meat
8
56
and
her
parents
were
astonished
but
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
was
done
9
1
then
he
called
his
twelve
disciples
together
and
gave
them
power
and
authority
over
all
devils
and
to
cure
diseases
9
2
and
he
sent
them
to
preach
the
kingdom
of
god
and
to
heal
the
sick
9
3
and
he
said
unto
them
take
nothing
for
your
journey
neither
staves
nor
scrip
neither
bread
neither
money
neither
have
two
coats
apiece
9
4
and
whatsoever
house
ye
enter
into
there
abide
and
thence
depart
9
5
and
whosoever
will
not
receive
you
when
ye
go
out
of
that
city
shake
off
the
very
dust
from
your
feet
for
a
testimony
against
them
9
6
and
they
departed
and
went
through
the
towns
preaching
the
gospel
and
healing
every
where
9
7
now
herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
all
that
was
done
by
him
and
he
was
perplexed
because
that
it
was
said
of
some
that
john
was
risen
from
the
dead
9
8
and
of
some
that
elias
had
appeared
and
of
others
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
was
risen
again
9
9
and
herod
said
john
have
i
beheaded
but
who
is
this
of
whom
i
hear
such
things
and
he
desired
to
see
him
9
10
and
the
apostles
when
they
were
returned
told
him
all
that
they
had
done
and
he
took
them
and
went
aside
privately
into
a
desert
place
belonging
to
the
city
called
bethsaida
9
11
and
the
people
when
they
knew
it
followed
him
and
he
received
them
and
spake
unto
them
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
healed
them
that
had
need
of
healing
9
12
and
when
the
day
began
to
wear
away
then
came
the
twelve
and
said
unto
him
send
the
multitude
away
that
they
may
go
into
the
towns
and
country
round
about
and
lodge
and
get
victuals
for
we
are
here
in
a
desert
place
9
13
but
he
said
unto
them
give
ye
them
to
eat
and
they
said
we
have
no
more
but
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
except
we
should
go
and
buy
meat
for
all
this
people
9
14
for
they
were
about
five
thousand
men
and
he
said
to
his
disciples
make
them
sit
down
by
fifties
in
a
company
9
15
and
they
did
so
and
made
them
all
sit
down
9
16
then
he
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
blessed
them
and
brake
and
gave
to
the
disciples
to
set
before
the
multitude
9
17
and
they
did
eat
and
were
all
filled
and
there
was
taken
up
of
fragments
that
remained
to
them
twelve
baskets
9
18
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
alone
praying
his
disciples
were
with
him
and
he
asked
them
saying
whom
say
the
people
that
i
am
9
19
they
answering
said
john
the
baptist
but
some
say
elias
and
others
say
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
is
risen
again
9
20
he
said
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
peter
answering
said
the
christ
of
god
9
21
and
he
straitly
charged
them
and
commanded
them
to
tell
no
man
that
thing
9
22
saying
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
slain
and
be
raised
the
third
day
9
23
and
he
said
to
them
all
if
any
man
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
daily
and
follow
me
9
24
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
but
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
the
same
shall
save
it
9
25
for
what
is
a
man
advantaged
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
himself
or
be
cast
away
9
26
for
whosoever
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
of
him
shall
the
son
of
man
be
ashamed
when
he
shall
come
in
his
own
glory
and
in
his
father’s
and
of
the
holy
angels
9
27
but
i
tell
you
of
a
truth
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
see
the
kingdom
of
god
9
28
and
it
came
to
pass
about
an
eight
days
after
these
sayings
he
took
peter
and
john
and
james
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
to
pray
9
29
and
as
he
prayed
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
altered
and
his
raiment
was
white
and
glistering
9
30
and
behold
there
talked
with
him
two
men
which
were
moses
and
elias
9
31
who
appeared
in
glory
and
spake
of
his
decease
which
he
should
accomplish
at
jerusalem
9
32
but
peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
were
heavy
with
sleep
and
when
they
were
awake
they
saw
his
glory
and
the
two
men
that
stood
with
him
9
33
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
departed
from
him
peter
said
unto
jesus
master
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
and
let
us
make
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
moses
and
one
for
elias
not
knowing
what
he
said
9
34
while
he
thus
spake
there
came
a
cloud
and
overshadowed
them
and
they
feared
as
they
entered
into
the
cloud
9
35
and
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
9
36
and
when
the
voice
was
past
jesus
was
found
alone
and
they
kept
it
close
and
told
no
man
in
those
days
any
of
those
things
which
they
had
seen
9
37
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
next
day
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
hill
much
people
met
him
9
38
and
behold
a
man
of
the
company
cried
out
saying
master
i
beseech
thee
look
upon
my
son
for
he
is
mine
only
child
9
39
and
lo
a
spirit
taketh
him
and
he
suddenly
crieth
out
and
it
teareth
him
that
he
foameth
again
and
bruising
him
hardly
departeth
from
him
9
40
and
i
besought
thy
disciples
to
cast
him
out
and
they
could
not
9
41
and
jesus
answering
said
o
faithless
and
perverse
generation
how
long
shall
i
be
with
you
and
suffer
you
bring
thy
son
hither
9
42
and
as
he
was
yet
a
coming
the
devil
threw
him
down
and
tare
him
and
jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit
and
healed
the
child
and
delivered
him
again
to
his
father
9
43
and
they
were
all
amazed
at
the
mighty
power
of
god
but
while
they
wondered
every
one
at
all
things
which
jesus
did
he
said
unto
his
disciples
9
44
let
these
sayings
sink
down
into
your
ears
for
the
son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men
9
45
but
they
understood
not
this
saying
and
it
was
hid
from
them
that
they
perceived
it
not
and
they
feared
to
ask
him
of
that
saying
9
46
then
there
arose
a
reasoning
among
them
which
of
them
should
be
greatest
9
47
and
jesus
perceiving
the
thought
of
their
heart
took
a
child
and
set
him
by
him
9
48
and
said
unto
them
whosoever
shall
receive
this
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me
for
he
that
is
least
among
you
all
the
same
shall
be
great
9
49
and
john
answered
and
said
master
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
name
and
we
forbad
him
because
he
followeth
not
with
us
9
50
and
jesus
said
unto
him
forbid
him
not
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
for
us
9
51
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
time
was
come
that
he
should
be
received
up
he
stedfastly
set
his
face
to
go
to
jerusalem
9
52
and
sent
messengers
before
his
face
and
they
went
and
entered
into
a
village
of
the
samaritans
to
make
ready
for
him
9
53
and
they
did
not
receive
him
because
his
face
was
as
though
he
would
go
to
jerusalem
9
54
and
when
his
disciples
james
and
john
saw
this
they
said
lord
wilt
thou
that
we
command
fire
to
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
them
even
as
elias
did
9
55
but
he
turned
and
rebuked
them
and
said
ye
know
not
what
manner
of
spirit
ye
are
of
9
56
for
the
son
of
man
is
not
come
to
destroy
men’s
lives
but
to
save
them
and
they
went
to
another
village
9
57
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
went
in
the
way
a
certain
man
said
unto
him
lord
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
9
58
and
jesus
said
unto
him
foxes
have
holes
and
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
9
59
and
he
said
unto
another
follow
me
but
he
said
lord
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father
9
60
jesus
said
unto
him
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
but
go
thou
and
preach
the
kingdom
of
god
9
61
and
another
also
said
lord
i
will
follow
thee
but
let
me
first
go
bid
them
farewell
which
are
at
home
at
my
house
9
62
and
jesus
said
unto
him
no
man
having
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
and
looking
back
is
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
god
10
1
after
these
things
the
lord
appointed
other
seventy
also
and
sent
them
two
and
two
before
his
face
into
every
city
and
place
whither
he
himself
would
come
10
2
therefore
said
he
unto
them
the
harvest
truly
is
great
but
the
labourers
are
few
pray
ye
therefore
the
lord
of
the
harvest
that
he
would
send
forth
labourers
into
his
harvest
10
3
go
your
ways
behold
i
send
you
forth
as
lambs
among
wolves
10
4
carry
neither
purse
nor
scrip
nor
shoes
and
salute
no
man
by
the
way
10
5
and
into
whatsoever
house
ye
enter
first
say
peace
be
to
this
house
10
6
and
if
the
son
of
peace
be
there
your
peace
shall
rest
upon
it
if
not
it
shall
turn
to
you
again
10
7
and
in
the
same
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
such
things
as
they
give
for
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
go
not
from
house
to
house
10
8
and
into
whatsoever
city
ye
enter
and
they
receive
you
eat
such
things
as
are
set
before
you
10
9
and
heal
the
sick
that
are
therein
and
say
unto
them
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
nigh
unto
you
10
10
but
into
whatsoever
city
ye
enter
and
they
receive
you
not
go
your
ways
out
into
the
streets
of
the
same
and
say
10
11
even
the
very
dust
of
your
city
which
cleaveth
on
us
we
do
wipe
off
against
you
notwithstanding
be
ye
sure
of
this
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
nigh
unto
you
10
12
but
i
say
unto
you
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
in
that
day
for
sodom
than
for
that
city
10
13
woe
unto
thee
chorazin
woe
unto
thee
bethsaida
for
if
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
in
tyre
and
sidon
which
have
been
done
in
you
they
had
a
great
while
ago
repented
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
10
14
but
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
tyre
and
sidon
at
the
judgment
than
for
you
10
15
and
thou
capernaum
which
art
exalted
to
heaven
shalt
be
thrust
down
to
hell
10
16
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
me
10
17
and
the
seventy
returned
again
with
joy
saying
lord
even
the
devils
are
subject
unto
us
through
thy
name
10
18
and
he
said
unto
them
i
beheld
satan
as
lightning
fall
from
heaven
10
19
behold
i
give
unto
you
power
to
tread
on
serpents
and
scorpions
and
over
all
the
power
of
the
enemy
and
nothing
shall
by
any
means
hurt
you
10
20
notwithstanding
in
this
rejoice
not
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
you
but
rather
rejoice
because
your
names
are
written
in
heaven
10
21
in
that
hour
jesus
rejoiced
in
spirit
and
said
i
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
that
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
10
22
all
things
are
delivered
to
me
of
my
father
and
no
man
knoweth
who
the
son
is
but
the
father
and
who
the
father
is
but
the
son
and
he
to
whom
the
son
will
reveal
him
10
23
and
he
turned
him
unto
his
disciples
and
said
privately
blessed
are
the
eyes
which
see
the
things
that
ye
see
10
24
for
i
tell
you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see
and
have
not
seen
them
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear
and
have
not
heard
them
10
25
and
behold
a
certain
lawyer
stood
up
and
tempted
him
saying
master
what
shall
i
do
to
inherit
eternal
life
10
26
he
said
unto
him
what
is
written
in
the
law
how
readest
thou
10
27
and
he
answering
said
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
strength
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
10
28
and
he
said
unto
him
thou
hast
answered
right
this
do
and
thou
shalt
live
10
29
but
he
willing
to
justify
himself
said
unto
jesus
and
who
is
my
neighbour
10
30
and
jesus
answering
said
a
certain
man
went
down
from
jerusalem
to
jericho
and
fell
among
thieves
which
stripped
him
of
his
raiment
and
wounded
him
and
departed
leaving
him
half
dead
10
31
and
by
chance
there
came
down
a
certain
priest
that
way
and
when
he
saw
him
he
passed
by
on
the
other
side
10
32
and
likewise
a
levite
when
he
was
at
the
place
came
and
looked
on
him
and
passed
by
on
the
other
side
10
33
but
a
certain
samaritan
as
he
journeyed
came
where
he
was
and
when
he
saw
him
he
had
compassion
on
him
10
34
and
went
to
him
and
bound
up
his
wounds
pouring
in
oil
and
wine
and
set
him
on
his
own
beast
and
brought
him
to
an
inn
and
took
care
of
him
10
35
and
on
the
morrow
when
he
departed
he
took
out
two
pence
and
gave
them
to
the
host
and
said
unto
him
take
care
of
him
and
whatsoever
thou
spendest
more
when
i
come
again
i
will
repay
thee
10
36
which
now
of
these
three
thinkest
thou
was
neighbour
unto
him
that
fell
among
the
thieves
10
37
and
he
said
he
that
shewed
mercy
on
him
then
said
jesus
unto
him
go
and
do
thou
likewise
10
38
now
it
came
to
pass
as
they
went
that
he
entered
into
a
certain
village
and
a
certain
woman
named
martha
received
him
into
her
house
10
39
and
she
had
a
sister
called
mary
which
also
sat
at
jesus’
feet
and
heard
his
word
10
40
but
martha
was
cumbered
about
much
serving
and
came
to
him
and
said
lord
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
alone
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
me
10
41
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
martha
martha
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
10
42
but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
11
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
was
praying
in
a
certain
place
when
he
ceased
one
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him
lord
teach
us
to
pray
as
john
also
taught
his
disciples
11
2
and
he
said
unto
them
when
ye
pray
say
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
as
in
heaven
so
in
earth
11
3
give
us
day
by
day
our
daily
bread
11
4
and
forgive
us
our
sins
for
we
also
forgive
every
one
that
is
indebted
to
us
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
11
5
and
he
said
unto
them
which
of
you
shall
have
a
friend
and
shall
go
unto
him
at
midnight
and
say
unto
him
friend
lend
me
three
loaves
11
6
for
a
friend
of
mine
in
his
journey
is
come
to
me
and
i
have
nothing
to
set
before
him
11
7
and
he
from
within
shall
answer
and
say
trouble
me
not
the
door
is
now
shut
and
my
children
are
with
me
in
bed
i
cannot
rise
and
give
thee
11
8
i
say
unto
you
though
he
will
not
rise
and
give
him
because
he
is
his
friend
yet
because
of
his
importunity
he
will
rise
and
give
him
as
many
as
he
needeth
11
9
and
i
say
unto
you
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
11
10
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened
11
11
if
a
son
shall
ask
bread
of
any
of
you
that
is
a
father
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
for
a
fish
give
him
a
serpent
11
12
or
if
he
shall
ask
an
egg
will
he
offer
him
a
scorpion
11
13
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
heavenly
father
give
the
holy
spirit
to
them
that
ask
him
11
14
and
he
was
casting
out
a
devil
and
it
was
dumb
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
devil
was
gone
out
the
dumb
spake
and
the
people
wondered
11
15
but
some
of
them
said
he
casteth
out
devils
through
beelzebub
the
chief
of
the
devils
11
16
and
others
tempting
him
sought
of
him
a
sign
from
heaven
11
17
but
he
knowing
their
thoughts
said
unto
them
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
desolation
and
a
house
divided
against
a
house
falleth
11
18
if
satan
also
be
divided
against
himself
how
shall
his
kingdom
stand
because
ye
say
that
i
cast
out
devils
through
beelzebub
11
19
and
if
i
by
beelzebub
cast
out
devils
by
whom
do
your
sons
cast
them
out
therefore
shall
they
be
your
judges
11
20
but
if
i
with
the
finger
of
god
cast
out
devils
no
doubt
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
upon
you
11
21
when
a
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
palace
his
goods
are
in
peace
11
22
but
when
a
stronger
than
he
shall
come
upon
him
and
overcome
him
he
taketh
from
him
all
his
armour
wherein
he
trusted
and
divideth
his
spoils
11
23
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
11
24
when
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
man
he
walketh
through
dry
places
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
he
saith
i
will
return
unto
my
house
whence
i
came
out
11
25
and
when
he
cometh
he
findeth
it
swept
and
garnished
11
26
then
goeth
he
and
taketh
to
him
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
himself
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
there
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
first
11
27
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
spake
these
things
a
certain
woman
of
the
company
lifted
up
her
voice
and
said
unto
him
blessed
is
the
womb
that
bare
thee
and
the
paps
which
thou
hast
sucked
11
28
but
he
said
yea
rather
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
of
god
and
keep
it
11
29
and
when
the
people
were
gathered
thick
together
he
began
to
say
this
is
an
evil
generation
they
seek
a
sign
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
it
but
the
sign
of
jonas
the
prophet
11
30
for
as
jonas
was
a
sign
unto
the
ninevites
so
shall
also
the
son
of
man
be
to
this
generation
11
31
the
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of
this
generation
and
condemn
them
for
she
came
from
the
utmost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
behold
a
greater
than
solomon
is
here
11
32
the
men
of
nineve
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
for
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
jonas
and
behold
a
greater
than
jonas
is
here
11
33
no
man
when
he
hath
lighted
a
candle
putteth
it
in
a
secret
place
neither
under
a
bushel
but
on
a
candlestick
that
they
which
come
in
may
see
the
light
11
34
the
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
therefore
when
thine
eye
is
single
thy
whole
body
also
is
full
of
light
but
when
thine
eye
is
evil
thy
body
also
is
full
of
darkness
11
35
take
heed
therefore
that
the
light
which
is
in
thee
be
not
darkness
11
36
if
thy
whole
body
therefore
be
full
of
light
having
no
part
dark
the
whole
shall
be
full
of
light
as
when
the
bright
shining
of
a
candle
doth
give
thee
light
11
37
and
as
he
spake
a
certain
pharisee
besought
him
to
dine
with
him
and
he
went
in
and
sat
down
to
meat
11
38
and
when
the
pharisee
saw
it
he
marvelled
that
he
had
not
first
washed
before
dinner
11
39
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
now
do
ye
pharisees
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
the
platter
but
your
inward
part
is
full
of
ravening
and
wickedness
11
40
ye
fools
did
not
he
that
made
that
which
is
without
make
that
which
is
within
also
11
41
but
rather
give
alms
of
such
things
as
ye
have
and
behold
all
things
are
clean
unto
you
11
42
but
woe
unto
you
pharisees
for
ye
tithe
mint
and
rue
and
all
manner
of
herbs
and
pass
over
judgment
and
the
love
of
god
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
11
43
woe
unto
you
pharisees
for
ye
love
the
uppermost
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
greetings
in
the
markets
11
44
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
are
as
graves
which
appear
not
and
the
men
that
walk
over
them
are
not
aware
of
them
11
45
then
answered
one
of
the
lawyers
and
said
unto
him
master
thus
saying
thou
reproachest
us
also
11
46
and
he
said
woe
unto
you
also
ye
lawyers
for
ye
lade
men
with
burdens
grievous
to
be
borne
and
ye
yourselves
touch
not
the
burdens
with
one
of
your
fingers
11
47
woe
unto
you
for
ye
build
the
sepulchres
of
the
prophets
and
your
fathers
killed
them
11
48
truly
ye
bear
witness
that
ye
allow
the
deeds
of
your
fathers
for
they
indeed
killed
them
and
ye
build
their
sepulchres
11
49
therefore
also
said
the
wisdom
of
god
i
will
send
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
some
of
them
they
shall
slay
and
persecute
11
50
that
the
blood
of
all
the
prophets
which
was
shed
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
may
be
required
of
this
generation
11
51
from
the
blood
of
abel
unto
the
blood
of
zacharias
which
perished
between
the
altar
and
the
temple
verily
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
required
of
this
generation
11
52
woe
unto
you
lawyers
for
ye
have
taken
away
the
key
of
knowledge
ye
entered
not
in
yourselves
and
them
that
were
entering
in
ye
hindered
11
53
and
as
he
said
these
things
unto
them
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
began
to
urge
him
vehemently
and
to
provoke
him
to
speak
of
many
things
11
54
laying
wait
for
him
and
seeking
to
catch
something
out
of
his
mouth
that
they
might
accuse
him
12
1
in
the
mean
time
when
there
were
gathered
together
an
innumerable
multitude
of
people
insomuch
that
they
trode
one
upon
another
he
began
to
say
unto
his
disciples
first
of
all
beware
ye
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
which
is
hypocrisy
12
2
for
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
revealed
neither
hid
that
shall
not
be
known
12
3
therefore
whatsoever
ye
have
spoken
in
darkness
shall
be
heard
in
the
light
and
that
which
ye
have
spoken
in
the
ear
in
closets
shall
be
proclaimed
upon
the
housetops
12
4
and
i
say
unto
you
my
friends
be
not
afraid
of
them
that
kill
the
body
and
after
that
have
no
more
that
they
can
do
12
5
but
i
will
forewarn
you
whom
ye
shall
fear
fear
him
which
after
he
hath
killed
hath
power
to
cast
into
hell
yea
i
say
unto
you
fear
him
12
6
are
not
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
farthings
and
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
before
god
12
7
but
even
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
fear
not
therefore
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
12
8
also
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
confess
me
before
men
him
shall
the
son
of
man
also
confess
before
the
angels
of
god
12
9
but
he
that
denieth
me
before
men
shall
be
denied
before
the
angels
of
god
12
10
and
whosoever
shall
speak
a
word
against
the
son
of
man
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
but
unto
him
that
blasphemeth
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
12
11
and
when
they
bring
you
unto
the
synagogues
and
unto
magistrates
and
powers
take
ye
no
thought
how
or
what
thing
ye
shall
answer
or
what
ye
shall
say
12
12
for
the
holy
ghost
shall
teach
you
in
the
same
hour
what
ye
ought
to
say
12
13
and
one
of
the
company
said
unto
him
master
speak
to
my
brother
that
he
divide
the
inheritance
with
me
12
14
and
he
said
unto
him
man
who
made
me
a
judge
or
a
divider
over
you
12
15
and
he
said
unto
them
take
heed
and
beware
of
covetousness
for
a
man’s
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
which
he
possesseth
12
16
and
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
saying
the
ground
of
a
certain
rich
man
brought
forth
plentifully
12
17
and
he
thought
within
himself
saying
what
shall
i
do
because
i
have
no
room
where
to
bestow
my
fruits
12
18
and
he
said
this
will
i
do
i
will
pull
down
my
barns
and
build
greater
and
there
will
i
bestow
all
my
fruits
and
my
goods
12
19
and
i
will
say
to
my
soul
soul
thou
hast
much
goods
laid
up
for
many
years
take
thine
ease
eat
drink
and
be
merry
12
20
but
god
said
unto
him
thou
fool
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee
then
whose
shall
those
things
be
which
thou
hast
provided
12
21
so
is
he
that
layeth
up
treasure
for
himself
and
is
not
rich
toward
god
12
22
and
he
said
unto
his
disciples
therefore
i
say
unto
you
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
neither
for
the
body
what
ye
shall
put
on
12
23
the
life
is
more
than
meat
and
the
body
is
more
than
raiment
12
24
consider
the
ravens
for
they
neither
sow
nor
reap
which
neither
have
storehouse
nor
barn
and
god
feedeth
them
how
much
more
are
ye
better
than
the
fowls
12
25
and
which
of
you
with
taking
thought
can
add
to
his
stature
one
cubit
12
26
if
ye
then
be
not
able
to
do
that
thing
which
is
least
why
take
ye
thought
for
the
rest
12
27
consider
the
lilies
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
they
spin
not
and
yet
i
say
unto
you
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
12
28
if
then
god
so
clothe
the
grass
which
is
to
day
in
the
field
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
how
much
more
will
he
clothe
you
o
ye
of
little
faith
12
29
and
seek
not
ye
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
neither
be
ye
of
doubtful
mind
12
30
for
all
these
things
do
the
nations
of
the
world
seek
after
and
your
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
things
12
31
but
rather
seek
ye
the
kingdom
of
god
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
12
32
fear
not
little
flock
for
it
is
your
father’s
good
pleasure
to
give
you
the
kingdom
12
33
sell
that
ye
have
and
give
alms
provide
yourselves
bags
which
wax
not
old
a
treasure
in
the
heavens
that
faileth
not
where
no
thief
approacheth
neither
moth
corrupteth
12
34
for
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
12
35
let
your
loins
be
girded
about
and
your
lights
burning
12
36
and
ye
yourselves
like
unto
men
that
wait
for
their
lord
when
he
will
return
from
the
wedding
that
when
he
cometh
and
knocketh
they
may
open
unto
him
immediately
12
37
blessed
are
those
servants
whom
the
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
watching
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
he
shall
gird
himself
and
make
them
to
sit
down
to
meat
and
will
come
forth
and
serve
them
12
38
and
if
he
shall
come
in
the
second
watch
or
come
in
the
third
watch
and
find
them
so
blessed
are
those
servants
12
39
and
this
know
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
what
hour
the
thief
would
come
he
would
have
watched
and
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
through
12
40
be
ye
therefore
ready
also
for
the
son
of
man
cometh
at
an
hour
when
ye
think
not
12
41
then
peter
said
unto
him
lord
speakest
thou
this
parable
unto
us
or
even
to
all
12
42
and
the
lord
said
who
then
is
that
faithful
and
wise
steward
whom
his
lord
shall
make
ruler
over
his
household
to
give
them
their
portion
of
meat
in
due
season
12
43
blessed
is
that
servant
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
doing
12
44
of
a
truth
i
say
unto
you
that
he
will
make
him
ruler
over
all
that
he
hath
12
45
but
and
if
that
servant
say
in
his
heart
my
lord
delayeth
his
coming
and
shall
begin
to
beat
the
menservants
and
maidens
and
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
be
drunken
12
46
the
lord
of
that
servant
will
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
him
and
at
an
hour
when
he
is
not
aware
and
will
cut
him
in
sunder
and
will
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
unbelievers
12
47
and
that
servant
which
knew
his
lord’s
will
and
prepared
not
himself
neither
did
according
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
many
stripes
12
48
but
he
that
knew
not
and
did
commit
things
worthy
of
stripes
shall
be
beaten
with
few
stripes
for
unto
whomsoever
much
is
given
of
him
shall
be
much
required
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
much
of
him
they
will
ask
the
more
12
49
i
am
come
to
send
fire
on
the
earth
and
what
will
i
if
it
be
already
kindled
12
50
but
i
have
a
baptism
to
be
baptized
with
and
how
am
i
straitened
till
it
be
accomplished
12
51
suppose
ye
that
i
am
come
to
give
peace
on
earth
i
tell
you
nay
but
rather
division
12
52
for
from
henceforth
there
shall
be
five
in
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
12
53
the
father
shall
be
divided
against
the
son
and
the
son
against
the
father
the
mother
against
the
daughter
and
the
daughter
against
the
mother
the
mother
in
law
against
her
daughter
in
law
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law
12
54
and
he
said
also
to
the
people
when
ye
see
a
cloud
rise
out
of
the
west
straightway
ye
say
there
cometh
a
shower
and
so
it
is
12
55
and
when
ye
see
the
south
wind
blow
ye
say
there
will
be
heat
and
it
cometh
to
pass
12
56
ye
hypocrites
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
and
of
the
earth
but
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
discern
this
time
12
57
yea
and
why
even
of
yourselves
judge
ye
not
what
is
right
12
58
when
thou
goest
with
thine
adversary
to
the
magistrate
as
thou
art
in
the
way
give
diligence
that
thou
mayest
be
delivered
from
him
lest
he
hale
thee
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer
and
the
officer
cast
thee
into
prison
12
59
i
tell
thee
thou
shalt
not
depart
thence
till
thou
hast
paid
the
very
last
mite
13
1
there
were
present
at
that
season
some
that
told
him
of
the
galilaeans
whose
blood
pilate
had
mingled
with
their
sacrifices
13
2
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
suppose
ye
that
these
galilaeans
were
sinners
above
all
the
galilaeans
because
they
suffered
such
things
13
3
i
tell
you
nay
but
except
ye
repent
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish
13
4
or
those
eighteen
upon
whom
the
tower
in
siloam
fell
and
slew
them
think
ye
that
they
were
sinners
above
all
men
that
dwelt
in
jerusalem
13
5
i
tell
you
nay
but
except
ye
repent
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish
13
6
he
spake
also
this
parable
a
certain
man
had
a
fig
tree
planted
in
his
vineyard
and
he
came
and
sought
fruit
thereon
and
found
none
13
7
then
said
he
unto
the
dresser
of
his
vineyard
behold
these
three
years
i
come
seeking
fruit
on
this
fig
tree
and
find
none
cut
it
down
why
cumbereth
it
the
ground
13
8
and
he
answering
said
unto
him
lord
let
it
alone
this
year
also
till
i
shall
dig
about
it
and
dung
it
13
9
and
if
it
bear
fruit
well
and
if
not
then
after
that
thou
shalt
cut
it
down
13
10
and
he
was
teaching
in
one
of
the
synagogues
on
the
sabbath
13
11
and
behold
there
was
a
woman
which
had
a
spirit
of
infirmity
eighteen
years
and
was
bowed
together
and
could
in
no
wise
lift
up
herself
13
12
and
when
jesus
saw
her
he
called
her
to
him
and
said
unto
her
woman
thou
art
loosed
from
thine
infirmity
13
13
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
and
immediately
she
was
made
straight
and
glorified
god
13
14
and
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
answered
with
indignation
because
that
jesus
had
healed
on
the
sabbath
day
and
said
unto
the
people
there
are
six
days
in
which
men
ought
to
work
in
them
therefore
come
and
be
healed
and
not
on
the
sabbath
day
13
15
the
lord
then
answered
him
and
said
thou
hypocrite
doth
not
each
one
of
you
on
the
sabbath
loose
his
ox
or
his
ass
from
the
stall
and
lead
him
away
to
watering
13
16
and
ought
not
this
woman
being
a
daughter
of
abraham
whom
satan
hath
bound
lo
these
eighteen
years
be
loosed
from
this
bond
on
the
sabbath
day
13
17
and
when
he
had
said
these
things
all
his
adversaries
were
ashamed
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
for
all
the
glorious
things
that
were
done
by
him
13
18
then
said
he
unto
what
is
the
kingdom
of
god
like
and
whereunto
shall
i
resemble
it
13
19
it
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
which
a
man
took
and
cast
into
his
garden
and
it
grew
and
waxed
a
great
tree
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
lodged
in
the
branches
of
it
13
20
and
again
he
said
whereunto
shall
i
liken
the
kingdom
of
god
13
21
it
is
like
leaven
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal
till
the
whole
was
leavened
13
22
and
he
went
through
the
cities
and
villages
teaching
and
journeying
toward
jerusalem
13
23
then
said
one
unto
him
lord
are
there
few
that
be
saved
and
he
said
unto
them
13
24
strive
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
many
i
say
unto
you
will
seek
to
enter
in
and
shall
not
be
able
13
25
when
once
the
master
of
the
house
is
risen
up
and
hath
shut
to
the
door
and
ye
begin
to
stand
without
and
to
knock
at
the
door
saying
lord
lord
open
unto
us
and
he
shall
answer
and
say
unto
you
i
know
you
not
whence
ye
are
13
26
then
shall
ye
begin
to
say
we
have
eaten
and
drunk
in
thy
presence
and
thou
hast
taught
in
our
streets
13
27
but
he
shall
say
i
tell
you
i
know
you
not
whence
ye
are
depart
from
me
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity
13
28
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
when
ye
shall
see
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
and
all
the
prophets
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
you
yourselves
thrust
out
13
29
and
they
shall
come
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
and
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
and
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
god
13
30
and
behold
there
are
last
which
shall
be
first
and
there
are
first
which
shall
be
last
13
31
the
same
day
there
came
certain
of
the
pharisees
saying
unto
him
get
thee
out
and
depart
hence
for
herod
will
kill
thee
13
32
and
he
said
unto
them
go
ye
and
tell
that
fox
behold
i
cast
out
devils
and
i
do
cures
to
day
and
to
morrow
and
the
third
day
i
shall
be
perfected
13
33
nevertheless
i
must
walk
to
day
and
to
morrow
and
the
day
following
for
it
cannot
be
that
a
prophet
perish
out
of
jerusalem
13
34
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
which
killest
the
prophets
and
stonest
them
that
are
sent
unto
thee
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
as
a
hen
doth
gather
her
brood
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
13
35
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
and
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
see
me
until
the
time
come
when
ye
shall
say
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
14
1
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
into
the
house
of
one
of
the
chief
pharisees
to
eat
bread
on
the
sabbath
day
that
they
watched
him
14
2
and
behold
there
was
a
certain
man
before
him
which
had
the
dropsy
14
3
and
jesus
answering
spake
unto
the
lawyers
and
pharisees
saying
is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
day
14
4
and
they
held
their
peace
and
he
took
him
and
healed
him
and
let
him
go
14
5
and
answered
them
saying
which
of
you
shall
have
an
ass
or
an
ox
fallen
into
a
pit
and
will
not
straightway
pull
him
out
on
the
sabbath
day
14
6
and
they
could
not
answer
him
again
to
these
things
14
7
and
he
put
forth
a
parable
to
those
which
were
bidden
when
he
marked
how
they
chose
out
the
chief
rooms
saying
unto
them
14
8
when
thou
art
bidden
of
any
man
to
a
wedding
sit
not
down
in
the
highest
room
lest
a
more
honourable
man
than
thou
be
bidden
of
him
14
9
and
he
that
bade
thee
and
him
come
and
say
to
thee
give
this
man
place
and
thou
begin
with
shame
to
take
the
lowest
room
14
10
but
when
thou
art
bidden
go
and
sit
down
in
the
lowest
room
that
when
he
that
bade
thee
cometh
he
may
say
unto
thee
friend
go
up
higher
then
shalt
thou
have
worship
in
the
presence
of
them
that
sit
at
meat
with
thee
14
11
for
whosoever
exalteth
himself
shall
be
abased
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
exalted
14
12
then
said
he
also
to
him
that
bade
him
when
thou
makest
a
dinner
or
a
supper
call
not
thy
friends
nor
thy
brethren
neither
thy
kinsmen
nor
thy
rich
neighbours
lest
they
also
bid
thee
again
and
a
recompence
be
made
thee
14
13
but
when
thou
makest
a
feast
call
the
poor
the
maimed
the
lame
the
blind
14
14
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
for
they
cannot
recompense
thee
for
thou
shalt
be
recompensed
at
the
resurrection
of
the
just
14
15
and
when
one
of
them
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
heard
these
things
he
said
unto
him
blessed
is
he
that
shall
eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
of
god
14
16
then
said
he
unto
him
a
certain
man
made
a
great
supper
and
bade
many
14
17
and
sent
his
servant
at
supper
time
to
say
to
them
that
were
bidden
come
for
all
things
are
now
ready
14
18
and
they
all
with
one
consent
began
to
make
excuse
the
first
said
unto
him
i
have
bought
a
piece
of
ground
and
i
must
needs
go
and
see
it
i
pray
thee
have
me
excused
14
19
and
another
said
i
have
bought
five
yoke
of
oxen
and
i
go
to
prove
them
i
pray
thee
have
me
excused
14
20
and
another
said
i
have
married
a
wife
and
therefore
i
cannot
come
14
21
so
that
servant
came
and
shewed
his
lord
these
things
then
the
master
of
the
house
being
angry
said
to
his
servant
go
out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city
and
bring
in
hither
the
poor
and
the
maimed
and
the
halt
and
the
blind
14
22
and
the
servant
said
lord
it
is
done
as
thou
hast
commanded
and
yet
there
is
room
14
23
and
the
lord
said
unto
the
servant
go
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel
them
to
come
in
that
my
house
may
be
filled
14
24
for
i
say
unto
you
that
none
of
those
men
which
were
bidden
shall
taste
of
my
supper
14
25
and
there
went
great
multitudes
with
him
and
he
turned
and
said
unto
them
14
26
if
any
man
come
to
me
and
hate
not
his
father
and
mother
and
wife
and
children
and
brethren
and
sisters
yea
and
his
own
life
also
he
cannot
be
my
disciple
14
27
and
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
cross
and
come
after
me
cannot
be
my
disciple
14
28
for
which
of
you
intending
to
build
a
tower
sitteth
not
down
first
and
counteth
the
cost
whether
he
have
sufficient
to
finish
it
14
29
lest
haply
after
he
hath
laid
the
foundation
and
is
not
able
to
finish
it
all
that
behold
it
begin
to
mock
him
14
30
saying
this
man
began
to
build
and
was
not
able
to
finish
14
31
or
what
king
going
to
make
war
against
another
king
sitteth
not
down
first
and
consulteth
whether
he
be
able
with
ten
thousand
to
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
thousand
14
32
or
else
while
the
other
is
yet
a
great
way
off
he
sendeth
an
ambassage
and
desireth
conditions
of
peace
14
33
so
likewise
whosoever
he
be
of
you
that
forsaketh
not
all
that
he
hath
he
cannot
be
my
disciple
14
34
salt
is
good
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
savour
wherewith
shall
it
be
seasoned
14
35
it
is
neither
fit
for
the
land
nor
yet
for
the
dunghill
but
men
cast
it
out
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
15
1
then
drew
near
unto
him
all
the
publicans
and
sinners
for
to
hear
him
15
2
and
the
pharisees
and
scribes
murmured
saying
this
man
receiveth
sinners
and
eateth
with
them
15
3
and
he
spake
this
parable
unto
them
saying
15
4
what
man
of
you
having
an
hundred
sheep
if
he
lose
one
of
them
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
in
the
wilderness
and
go
after
that
which
is
lost
until
he
find
it
15
5
and
when
he
hath
found
it
he
layeth
it
on
his
shoulders
rejoicing
15
6
and
when
he
cometh
home
he
calleth
together
his
friends
and
neighbours
saying
unto
them
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
15
7
i
say
unto
you
that
likewise
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
which
need
no
repentance
15
8
either
what
woman
having
ten
pieces
of
silver
if
she
lose
one
piece
doth
not
light
a
candle
and
sweep
the
house
and
seek
diligently
till
she
find
it
15
9
and
when
she
hath
found
it
she
calleth
her
friends
and
her
neighbours
together
saying
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
the
piece
which
i
had
lost
15
10
likewise
i
say
unto
you
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
15
11
and
he
said
a
certain
man
had
two
sons
15
12
and
the
younger
of
them
said
to
his
father
father
give
me
the
portion
of
goods
that
falleth
to
me
and
he
divided
unto
them
his
living
15
13
and
not
many
days
after
the
younger
son
gathered
all
together
and
took
his
journey
into
a
far
country
and
there
wasted
his
substance
with
riotous
living
15
14
and
when
he
had
spent
all
there
arose
a
mighty
famine
in
that
land
and
he
began
to
be
in
want
15
15
and
he
went
and
joined
himself
to
a
citizen
of
that
country
and
he
sent
him
into
his
fields
to
feed
swine
15
16
and
he
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat
and
no
man
gave
unto
him
15
17
and
when
he
came
to
himself
he
said
how
many
hired
servants
of
my
father’s
have
bread
enough
and
to
spare
and
i
perish
with
hunger
15
18
i
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
and
will
say
unto
him
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
thee
15
19
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
make
me
as
one
of
thy
hired
servants
15
20
and
he
arose
and
came
to
his
father
but
when
he
was
yet
a
great
way
off
his
father
saw
him
and
had
compassion
and
ran
and
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
15
21
and
the
son
said
unto
him
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
in
thy
sight
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
15
22
but
the
father
said
to
his
servants
bring
forth
the
best
robe
and
put
it
on
him
and
put
a
ring
on
his
hand
and
shoes
on
his
feet
15
23
and
bring
hither
the
fatted
calf
and
kill
it
and
let
us
eat
and
be
merry
15
24
for
this
my
son
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
he
was
lost
and
is
found
and
they
began
to
be
merry
15
25
now
his
elder
son
was
in
the
field
and
as
he
came
and
drew
nigh
to
the
house
he
heard
musick
and
dancing
15
26
and
he
called
one
of
the
servants
and
asked
what
these
things
meant
15
27
and
he
said
unto
him
thy
brother
is
come
and
thy
father
hath
killed
the
fatted
calf
because
he
hath
received
him
safe
and
sound
15
28
and
he
was
angry
and
would
not
go
in
therefore
came
his
father
out
and
intreated
him
15
29
and
he
answering
said
to
his
father
lo
these
many
years
do
i
serve
thee
neither
transgressed
i
at
any
time
thy
commandment
and
yet
thou
never
gavest
me
a
kid
that
i
might
make
merry
with
my
friends
15
30
but
as
soon
as
this
thy
son
was
come
which
hath
devoured
thy
living
with
harlots
thou
hast
killed
for
him
the
fatted
calf
15
31
and
he
said
unto
him
son
thou
art
ever
with
me
and
all
that
i
have
is
thine
15
32
it
was
meet
that
we
should
make
merry
and
be
glad
for
this
thy
brother
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
and
was
lost
and
is
found
16
1
and
he
said
also
unto
his
disciples
there
was
a
certain
rich
man
which
had
a
steward
and
the
same
was
accused
unto
him
that
he
had
wasted
his
goods
16
2
and
he
called
him
and
said
unto
him
how
is
it
that
i
hear
this
of
thee
give
an
account
of
thy
stewardship
for
thou
mayest
be
no
longer
steward
16
3
then
the
steward
said
within
himself
what
shall
i
do
for
my
lord
taketh
away
from
me
the
stewardship
i
cannot
dig
to
beg
i
am
ashamed
16
4
i
am
resolved
what
to
do
that
when
i
am
put
out
of
the
stewardship
they
may
receive
me
into
their
houses
16
5
so
he
called
every
one
of
his
lord’s
debtors
unto
him
and
said
unto
the
first
how
much
owest
thou
unto
my
lord
16
6
and
he
said
an
hundred
measures
of
oil
and
he
said
unto
him
take
thy
bill
and
sit
down
quickly
and
write
fifty
16
7
then
said
he
to
another
and
how
much
owest
thou
and
he
said
an
hundred
measures
of
wheat
and
he
said
unto
him
take
thy
bill
and
write
fourscore
16
8
and
the
lord
commended
the
unjust
steward
because
he
had
done
wisely
for
the
children
of
this
world
are
in
their
generation
wiser
than
the
children
of
light
16
9
and
i
say
unto
you
make
to
yourselves
friends
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
that
when
ye
fail
they
may
receive
you
into
everlasting
habitations
16
10
he
that
is
faithful
in
that
which
is
least
is
faithful
also
in
much
and
he
that
is
unjust
in
the
least
is
unjust
also
in
much
16
11
if
therefore
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
the
unrighteous
mammon
who
will
commit
to
your
trust
the
true
riches
16
12
and
if
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
that
which
is
another
man’s
who
shall
give
you
that
which
is
your
own
16
13
no
servant
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
ye
cannot
serve
god
and
mammon
16
14
and
the
pharisees
also
who
were
covetous
heard
all
these
things
and
they
derided
him
16
15
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
are
they
which
justify
yourselves
before
men
but
god
knoweth
your
hearts
for
that
which
is
highly
esteemed
among
men
is
abomination
in
the
sight
of
god
16
16
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
john
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
god
is
preached
and
every
man
presseth
into
it
16
17
and
it
is
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
to
pass
than
one
tittle
of
the
law
to
fail
16
18
whosoever
putteth
away
his
wife
and
marrieth
another
committeth
adultery
and
whosoever
marrieth
her
that
is
put
away
from
her
husband
committeth
adultery
16
19
there
was
a
certain
rich
man
which
was
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
16
20
and
there
was
a
certain
beggar
named
lazarus
which
was
laid
at
his
gate
full
of
sores
16
21
and
desiring
to
be
fed
with
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
the
rich
man’s
table
moreover
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
sores
16
22
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
beggar
died
and
was
carried
by
the
angels
into
abraham’s
bosom
the
rich
man
also
died
and
was
buried
16
23
and
in
hell
he
lift
up
his
eyes
being
in
torments
and
seeth
abraham
afar
off
and
lazarus
in
his
bosom
16
24
and
he
cried
and
said
father
abraham
have
mercy
on
me
and
send
lazarus
that
he
may
dip
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
water
and
cool
my
tongue
for
i
am
tormented
in
this
flame
16
25
but
abraham
said
son
remember
that
thou
in
thy
lifetime
receivedst
thy
good
things
and
likewise
lazarus
evil
things
but
now
he
is
comforted
and
thou
art
tormented
16
26
and
beside
all
this
between
us
and
you
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
so
that
they
which
would
pass
from
hence
to
you
cannot
neither
can
they
pass
to
us
that
would
come
from
thence
16
27
then
he
said
i
pray
thee
therefore
father
that
thou
wouldest
send
him
to
my
father’s
house
16
28
for
i
have
five
brethren
that
he
may
testify
unto
them
lest
they
also
come
into
this
place
of
torment
16
29
abraham
saith
unto
him
they
have
moses
and
the
prophets
let
them
hear
them
16
30
and
he
said
nay
father
abraham
but
if
one
went
unto
them
from
the
dead
they
will
repent
16
31
and
he
said
unto
him
if
they
hear
not
moses
and
the
prophets
neither
will
they
be
persuaded
though
one
rose
from
the
dead
17
1
then
said
he
unto
the
disciples
it
is
impossible
but
that
offences
will
come
but
woe
unto
him
through
whom
they
come
17
2
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
he
cast
into
the
sea
than
that
he
should
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
17
3
take
heed
to
yourselves
if
thy
brother
trespass
against
thee
rebuke
him
and
if
he
repent
forgive
him
17
4
and
if
he
trespass
against
thee
seven
times
in
a
day
and
seven
times
in
a
day
turn
again
to
thee
saying
i
repent
thou
shalt
forgive
him
17
5
and
the
apostles
said
unto
the
lord
increase
our
faith
17
6
and
the
lord
said
if
ye
had
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
ye
might
say
unto
this
sycamine
tree
be
thou
plucked
up
by
the
root
and
be
thou
planted
in
the
sea
and
it
should
obey
you
17
7
but
which
of
you
having
a
servant
plowing
or
feeding
cattle
will
say
unto
him
by
and
by
when
he
is
come
from
the
field
go
and
sit
down
to
meat
17
8
and
will
not
rather
say
unto
him
make
ready
wherewith
i
may
sup
and
gird
thyself
and
serve
me
till
i
have
eaten
and
drunken
and
afterward
thou
shalt
eat
and
drink
17
9
doth
he
thank
that
servant
because
he
did
the
things
that
were
commanded
him
i
trow
not
17
10
so
likewise
ye
when
ye
shall
have
done
all
those
things
which
are
commanded
you
say
we
are
unprofitable
servants
we
have
done
that
which
was
our
duty
to
do
17
11
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
to
jerusalem
that
he
passed
through
the
midst
of
samaria
and
galilee
17
12
and
as
he
entered
into
a
certain
village
there
met
him
ten
men
that
were
lepers
which
stood
afar
off
17
13
and
they
lifted
up
their
voices
and
said
jesus
master
have
mercy
on
us
17
14
and
when
he
saw
them
he
said
unto
them
go
shew
yourselves
unto
the
priests
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
went
they
were
cleansed
17
15
and
one
of
them
when
he
saw
that
he
was
healed
turned
back
and
with
a
loud
voice
glorified
god
17
16
and
fell
down
on
his
face
at
his
feet
giving
him
thanks
and
he
was
a
samaritan
17
17
and
jesus
answering
said
were
there
not
ten
cleansed
but
where
are
the
nine
17
18
there
are
not
found
that
returned
to
give
glory
to
god
save
this
stranger
17
19
and
he
said
unto
him
arise
go
thy
way
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
17
20
and
when
he
was
demanded
of
the
pharisees
when
the
kingdom
of
god
should
come
he
answered
them
and
said
the
kingdom
of
god
cometh
not
with
observation
17
21
neither
shall
they
say
lo
here
or
lo
there
for
behold
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
17
22
and
he
said
unto
the
disciples
the
days
will
come
when
ye
shall
desire
to
see
one
of
the
days
of
the
son
of
man
and
ye
shall
not
see
it
17
23
and
they
shall
say
to
you
see
here
or
see
there
go
not
after
them
nor
follow
them
17
24
for
as
the
lightning
that
lighteneth
out
of
the
one
part
under
heaven
shineth
unto
the
other
part
under
heaven
so
shall
also
the
son
of
man
be
in
his
day
17
25
but
first
must
he
suffer
many
things
and
be
rejected
of
this
generation
17
26
and
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
noe
so
shall
it
be
also
in
the
days
of
the
son
of
man
17
27
they
did
eat
they
drank
they
married
wives
they
were
given
in
marriage
until
the
day
that
noe
entered
into
the
ark
and
the
flood
came
and
destroyed
them
all
17
28
likewise
also
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
lot
they
did
eat
they
drank
they
bought
they
sold
they
planted
they
builded
17
29
but
the
same
day
that
lot
went
out
of
sodom
it
rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
heaven
and
destroyed
them
all
17
30
even
thus
shall
it
be
in
the
day
when
the
son
of
man
is
revealed
17
31
in
that
day
he
which
shall
be
upon
the
housetop
and
his
stuff
in
the
house
let
him
not
come
down
to
take
it
away
and
he
that
is
in
the
field
let
him
likewise
not
return
back
17
32
remember
lot’s
wife
17
33
whosoever
shall
seek
to
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
shall
preserve
it
17
34
i
tell
you
in
that
night
there
shall
be
two
men
in
one
bed
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
shall
be
left
17
35
two
women
shall
be
grinding
together
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
17
36
two
men
shall
be
in
the
field
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
17
37
and
they
answered
and
said
unto
him
where
lord
and
he
said
unto
them
wheresoever
the
body
is
thither
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together
18
1
and
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
to
this
end
that
men
ought
always
to
pray
and
not
to
faint
18
2
saying
there
was
in
a
city
a
judge
which
feared
not
god
neither
regarded
man
18
3
and
there
was
a
widow
in
that
city
and
she
came
unto
him
saying
avenge
me
of
mine
adversary
18
4
and
he
would
not
for
a
while
but
afterward
he
said
within
himself
though
i
fear
not
god
nor
regard
man
18
5
yet
because
this
widow
troubleth
me
i
will
avenge
her
lest
by
her
continual
coming
she
weary
me
18
6
and
the
lord
said
hear
what
the
unjust
judge
saith
18
7
and
shall
not
god
avenge
his
own
elect
which
cry
day
and
night
unto
him
though
he
bear
long
with
them
18
8
i
tell
you
that
he
will
avenge
them
speedily
nevertheless
when
the
son
of
man
cometh
shall
he
find
faith
on
the
earth
18
9
and
he
spake
this
parable
unto
certain
which
trusted
in
themselves
that
they
were
righteous
and
despised
others
18
10
two
men
went
up
into
the
temple
to
pray
the
one
a
pharisee
and
the
other
a
publican
18
11
the
pharisee
stood
and
prayed
thus
with
himself
god
i
thank
thee
that
i
am
not
as
other
men
are
extortioners
unjust
adulterers
or
even
as
this
publican
18
12
i
fast
twice
in
the
week
i
give
tithes
of
all
that
i
possess
18
13
and
the
publican
standing
afar
off
would
not
lift
up
so
much
as
his
eyes
unto
heaven
but
smote
upon
his
breast
saying
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
18
14
i
tell
you
this
man
went
down
to
his
house
justified
rather
than
the
other
for
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
be
abased
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
exalted
18
15
and
they
brought
unto
him
also
infants
that
he
would
touch
them
but
when
his
disciples
saw
it
they
rebuked
them
18
16
but
jesus
called
them
unto
him
and
said
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
god
18
17
verily
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
therein
18
18
and
a
certain
ruler
asked
him
saying
good
master
what
shall
i
do
to
inherit
eternal
life
18
19
and
jesus
said
unto
him
why
callest
thou
me
good
none
is
good
save
one
that
is
god
18
20
thou
knowest
the
commandments
do
not
commit
adultery
do
not
kill
do
not
steal
do
not
bear
false
witness
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
18
21
and
he
said
all
these
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
up
18
22
now
when
jesus
heard
these
things
he
said
unto
him
yet
lackest
thou
one
thing
sell
all
that
thou
hast
and
distribute
unto
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
follow
me
18
23
and
when
he
heard
this
he
was
very
sorrowful
for
he
was
very
rich
18
24
and
when
jesus
saw
that
he
was
very
sorrowful
he
said
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
18
25
for
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needle’s
eye
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
18
26
and
they
that
heard
it
said
who
then
can
be
saved
18
27
and
he
said
the
things
which
are
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
god
18
28
then
peter
said
lo
we
have
left
all
and
followed
thee
18
29
and
he
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
house
or
parents
or
brethren
or
wife
or
children
for
the
kingdom
of
god’s
sake
18
30
who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
in
this
present
time
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
everlasting
18
31
then
he
took
unto
him
the
twelve
and
said
unto
them
behold
we
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
all
things
that
are
written
by
the
prophets
concerning
the
son
of
man
shall
be
accomplished
18
32
for
he
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
gentiles
and
shall
be
mocked
and
spitefully
entreated
and
spitted
on
18
33
and
they
shall
scourge
him
and
put
him
to
death
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again
18
34
and
they
understood
none
of
these
things
and
this
saying
was
hid
from
them
neither
knew
they
the
things
which
were
spoken
18
35
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
was
come
nigh
unto
jericho
a
certain
blind
man
sat
by
the
way
side
begging
18
36
and
hearing
the
multitude
pass
by
he
asked
what
it
meant
18
37
and
they
told
him
that
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
18
38
and
he
cried
saying
jesus
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
me
18
39
and
they
which
went
before
rebuked
him
that
he
should
hold
his
peace
but
he
cried
so
much
the
more
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
me
18
40
and
jesus
stood
and
commanded
him
to
be
brought
unto
him
and
when
he
was
come
near
he
asked
him
18
41
saying
what
wilt
thou
that
i
shall
do
unto
thee
and
he
said
lord
that
i
may
receive
my
sight
18
42
and
jesus
said
unto
him
receive
thy
sight
thy
faith
hath
saved
thee
18
43
and
immediately
he
received
his
sight
and
followed
him
glorifying
god
and
all
the
people
when
they
saw
it
gave
praise
unto
god
19
1
and
jesus
entered
and
passed
through
jericho
19
2
and
behold
there
was
a
man
named
zacchaeus
which
was
the
chief
among
the
publicans
and
he
was
rich
19
3
and
he
sought
to
see
jesus
who
he
was
and
could
not
for
the
press
because
he
was
little
of
stature
19
4
and
he
ran
before
and
climbed
up
into
a
sycomore
tree
to
see
him
for
he
was
to
pass
that
way
19
5
and
when
jesus
came
to
the
place
he
looked
up
and
saw
him
and
said
unto
him
zacchaeus
make
haste
and
come
down
for
to
day
i
must
abide
at
thy
house
19
6
and
he
made
haste
and
came
down
and
received
him
joyfully
19
7
and
when
they
saw
it
they
all
murmured
saying
that
he
was
gone
to
be
guest
with
a
man
that
is
a
sinner
19
8
and
zacchaeus
stood
and
said
unto
the
lord
behold
lord
the
half
of
my
goods
i
give
to
the
poor
and
if
i
have
taken
any
thing
from
any
man
by
false
accusation
i
restore
him
fourfold
19
9
and
jesus
said
unto
him
this
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
house
forsomuch
as
he
also
is
a
son
of
abraham
19
10
for
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost
19
11
and
as
they
heard
these
things
he
added
and
spake
a
parable
because
he
was
nigh
to
jerusalem
and
because
they
thought
that
the
kingdom
of
god
should
immediately
appear
19
12
he
said
therefore
a
certain
nobleman
went
into
a
far
country
to
receive
for
himself
a
kingdom
and
to
return
19
13
and
he
called
his
ten
servants
and
delivered
them
ten
pounds
and
said
unto
them
occupy
till
i
come
19
14
but
his
citizens
hated
him
and
sent
a
message
after
him
saying
we
will
not
have
this
man
to
reign
over
us
19
15
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
was
returned
having
received
the
kingdom
then
he
commanded
these
servants
to
be
called
unto
him
to
whom
he
had
given
the
money
that
he
might
know
how
much
every
man
had
gained
by
trading
19
16
then
came
the
first
saying
lord
thy
pound
hath
gained
ten
pounds
19
17
and
he
said
unto
him
well
thou
good
servant
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
in
a
very
little
have
thou
authority
over
ten
cities
19
18
and
the
second
came
saying
lord
thy
pound
hath
gained
five
pounds
19
19
and
he
said
likewise
to
him
be
thou
also
over
five
cities
19
20
and
another
came
saying
lord
behold
here
is
thy
pound
which
i
have
kept
laid
up
in
a
napkin
19
21
for
i
feared
thee
because
thou
art
an
austere
man
thou
takest
up
that
thou
layedst
not
down
and
reapest
that
thou
didst
not
sow
19
22
and
he
saith
unto
him
out
of
thine
own
mouth
will
i
judge
thee
thou
wicked
servant
thou
knewest
that
i
was
an
austere
man
taking
up
that
i
laid
not
down
and
reaping
that
i
did
not
sow
19
23
wherefore
then
gavest
not
thou
my
money
into
the
bank
that
at
my
coming
i
might
have
required
mine
own
with
usury
19
24
and
he
said
unto
them
that
stood
by
take
from
him
the
pound
and
give
it
to
him
that
hath
ten
pounds
19
25
(and
they
said
unto
him
lord
he
hath
ten
pounds
)
19
26
for
i
say
unto
you
that
unto
every
one
which
hath
shall
be
given
and
from
him
that
hath
not
even
that
he
hath
shall
be
taken
away
from
him
19
27
but
those
mine
enemies
which
would
not
that
i
should
reign
over
them
bring
hither
and
slay
them
before
me
19
28
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
went
before
ascending
up
to
jerusalem
19
29
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
nigh
to
bethphage
and
bethany
at
the
mount
called
the
mount
of
olives
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
19
30
saying
go
ye
into
the
village
over
against
you
in
the
which
at
your
entering
ye
shall
find
a
colt
tied
whereon
yet
never
man
sat
loose
him
and
bring
him
hither
19
31
and
if
any
man
ask
you
why
do
ye
loose
him
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
him
because
the
lord
hath
need
of
him
19
32
and
they
that
were
sent
went
their
way
and
found
even
as
he
had
said
unto
them
19
33
and
as
they
were
loosing
the
colt
the
owners
thereof
said
unto
them
why
loose
ye
the
colt
19
34
and
they
said
the
lord
hath
need
of
him
19
35
and
they
brought
him
to
jesus
and
they
cast
their
garments
upon
the
colt
and
they
set
jesus
thereon
19
36
and
as
he
went
they
spread
their
clothes
in
the
way
19
37
and
when
he
was
come
nigh
even
now
at
the
descent
of
the
mount
of
olives
the
whole
multitude
of
the
disciples
began
to
rejoice
and
praise
god
with
a
loud
voice
for
all
the
mighty
works
that
they
had
seen
19
38
saying
blessed
be
the
king
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
peace
in
heaven
and
glory
in
the
highest
19
39
and
some
of
the
pharisees
from
among
the
multitude
said
unto
him
master
rebuke
thy
disciples
19
40
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
tell
you
that
if
these
should
hold
their
peace
the
stones
would
immediately
cry
out
19
41
and
when
he
was
come
near
he
beheld
the
city
and
wept
over
it
19
42
saying
if
thou
hadst
known
even
thou
at
least
in
this
thy
day
the
things
which
belong
unto
thy
peace
but
now
they
are
hid
from
thine
eyes
19
43
for
the
days
shall
come
upon
thee
that
thine
enemies
shall
cast
a
trench
about
thee
and
compass
thee
round
and
keep
thee
in
on
every
side
19
44
and
shall
lay
thee
even
with
the
ground
and
thy
children
within
thee
and
they
shall
not
leave
in
thee
one
stone
upon
another
because
thou
knewest
not
the
time
of
thy
visitation
19
45
and
he
went
into
the
temple
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
therein
and
them
that
bought
19
46
saying
unto
them
it
is
written
my
house
is
the
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
19
47
and
he
taught
daily
in
the
temple
but
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
chief
of
the
people
sought
to
destroy
him
19
48
and
could
not
find
what
they
might
do
for
all
the
people
were
very
attentive
to
hear
him
20
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
one
of
those
days
as
he
taught
the
people
in
the
temple
and
preached
the
gospel
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
upon
him
with
the
elders
20
2
and
spake
unto
him
saying
tell
us
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
or
who
is
he
that
gave
thee
this
authority
20
3
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
will
also
ask
you
one
thing
and
answer
me
20
4
the
baptism
of
john
was
it
from
heaven
or
of
men
20
5
and
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
if
we
shall
say
from
heaven
he
will
say
why
then
believed
ye
him
not
20
6
but
and
if
we
say
of
men
all
the
people
will
stone
us
for
they
be
persuaded
that
john
was
a
prophet
20
7
and
they
answered
that
they
could
not
tell
whence
it
was
20
8
and
jesus
said
unto
them
neither
tell
i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
20
9
then
began
he
to
speak
to
the
people
this
parable
a
certain
man
planted
a
vineyard
and
let
it
forth
to
husbandmen
and
went
into
a
far
country
for
a
long
time
20
10
and
at
the
season
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
husbandmen
that
they
should
give
him
of
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
but
the
husbandmen
beat
him
and
sent
him
away
empty
20
11
and
again
he
sent
another
servant
and
they
beat
him
also
and
entreated
him
shamefully
and
sent
him
away
empty
20
12
and
again
he
sent
a
third
and
they
wounded
him
also
and
cast
him
out
20
13
then
said
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
what
shall
i
do
i
will
send
my
beloved
son
it
may
be
they
will
reverence
him
when
they
see
him
20
14
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
him
they
reasoned
among
themselves
saying
this
is
the
heir
come
let
us
kill
him
that
the
inheritance
may
be
ours
20
15
so
they
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
killed
him
what
therefore
shall
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do
unto
them
20
16
he
shall
come
and
destroy
these
husbandmen
and
shall
give
the
vineyard
to
others
and
when
they
heard
it
they
said
god
forbid
20
17
and
he
beheld
them
and
said
what
is
this
then
that
is
written
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
20
18
whosoever
shall
fall
upon
that
stone
shall
be
broken
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
20
19
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
the
same
hour
sought
to
lay
hands
on
him
and
they
feared
the
people
for
they
perceived
that
he
had
spoken
this
parable
against
them
20
20
and
they
watched
him
and
sent
forth
spies
which
should
feign
themselves
just
men
that
they
might
take
hold
of
his
words
that
so
they
might
deliver
him
unto
the
power
and
authority
of
the
governor
20
21
and
they
asked
him
saying
master
we
know
that
thou
sayest
and
teachest
rightly
neither
acceptest
thou
the
person
of
any
but
teachest
the
way
of
god
truly
20
22
is
it
lawful
for
us
to
give
tribute
unto
caesar
or
no
20
23
but
he
perceived
their
craftiness
and
said
unto
them
why
tempt
ye
me
20
24
shew
me
a
penny
whose
image
and
superscription
hath
it
they
answered
and
said
caesar’s
20
25
and
he
said
unto
them
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
be
caesar’s
and
unto
god
the
things
which
be
god’s
20
26
and
they
could
not
take
hold
of
his
words
before
the
people
and
they
marvelled
at
his
answer
and
held
their
peace
20
27
then
came
to
him
certain
of
the
sadducees
which
deny
that
there
is
any
resurrection
and
they
asked
him
20
28
saying
master
moses
wrote
unto
us
if
any
man’s
brother
die
having
a
wife
and
he
die
without
children
that
his
brother
should
take
his
wife
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother
20
29
there
were
therefore
seven
brethren
and
the
first
took
a
wife
and
died
without
children
20
30
and
the
second
took
her
to
wife
and
he
died
childless
20
31
and
the
third
took
her
and
in
like
manner
the
seven
also
and
they
left
no
children
and
died
20
32
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also
20
33
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
of
them
is
she
for
seven
had
her
to
wife
20
34
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
the
children
of
this
world
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
20
35
but
they
which
shall
be
accounted
worthy
to
obtain
that
world
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
20
36
neither
can
they
die
any
more
for
they
are
equal
unto
the
angels
and
are
the
children
of
god
being
the
children
of
the
resurrection
20
37
now
that
the
dead
are
raised
even
moses
shewed
at
the
bush
when
he
calleth
the
lord
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
20
38
for
he
is
not
a
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
for
all
live
unto
him
20
39
then
certain
of
the
scribes
answering
said
master
thou
hast
well
said
20
40
and
after
that
they
durst
not
ask
him
any
question
at
all
20
41
and
he
said
unto
them
how
say
they
that
christ
is
david’s
son
20
42
and
david
himself
saith
in
the
book
of
psalms
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
20
43
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
20
44
david
therefore
calleth
him
lord
how
is
he
then
his
son
20
45
then
in
the
audience
of
all
the
people
he
said
unto
his
disciples
20
46
beware
of
the
scribes
which
desire
to
walk
in
long
robes
and
love
greetings
in
the
markets
and
the
highest
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
chief
rooms
at
feasts
20
47
which
devour
widows’
houses
and
for
a
shew
make
long
prayers
the
same
shall
receive
greater
damnation
21
1
and
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
rich
men
casting
their
gifts
into
the
treasury
21
2
and
he
saw
also
a
certain
poor
widow
casting
in
thither
two
mites
21
3
and
he
said
of
a
truth
i
say
unto
you
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
in
more
than
they
all
21
4
for
all
these
have
of
their
abundance
cast
in
unto
the
offerings
of
god
but
she
of
her
penury
hath
cast
in
all
the
living
that
she
had
21
5
and
as
some
spake
of
the
temple
how
it
was
adorned
with
goodly
stones
and
gifts
he
said
21
6
as
for
these
things
which
ye
behold
the
days
will
come
in
the
which
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down
21
7
and
they
asked
him
saying
master
but
when
shall
these
things
be
and
what
sign
will
there
be
when
these
things
shall
come
to
pass
21
8
and
he
said
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
deceived
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name
saying
i
am
christ
and
the
time
draweth
near
go
ye
not
therefore
after
them
21
9
but
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
commotions
be
not
terrified
for
these
things
must
first
come
to
pass
but
the
end
is
not
by
and
by
21
10
then
said
he
unto
them
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
21
11
and
great
earthquakes
shall
be
in
divers
places
and
famines
and
pestilences
and
fearful
sights
and
great
signs
shall
there
be
from
heaven
21
12
but
before
all
these
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
you
and
persecute
you
delivering
you
up
to
the
synagogues
and
into
prisons
being
brought
before
kings
and
rulers
for
my
name’s
sake
21
13
and
it
shall
turn
to
you
for
a
testimony
21
14
settle
it
therefore
in
your
hearts
not
to
meditate
before
what
ye
shall
answer
21
15
for
i
will
give
you
a
mouth
and
wisdom
which
all
your
adversaries
shall
not
be
able
to
gainsay
nor
resist
21
16
and
ye
shall
be
betrayed
both
by
parents
and
brethren
and
kinsfolks
and
friends
and
some
of
you
shall
they
cause
to
be
put
to
death
21
17
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name’s
sake
21
18
but
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
your
head
perish
21
19
in
your
patience
possess
ye
your
souls
21
20
and
when
ye
shall
see
jerusalem
compassed
with
armies
then
know
that
the
desolation
thereof
is
nigh
21
21
then
let
them
which
are
in
judaea
flee
to
the
mountains
and
let
them
which
are
in
the
midst
of
it
depart
out
and
let
not
them
that
are
in
the
countries
enter
thereinto
21
22
for
these
be
the
days
of
vengeance
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
be
fulfilled
21
23
but
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days
for
there
shall
be
great
distress
in
the
land
and
wrath
upon
this
people
21
24
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
shall
be
led
away
captive
into
all
nations
and
jerusalem
shall
be
trodden
down
of
the
gentiles
until
the
times
of
the
gentiles
be
fulfilled
21
25
and
there
shall
be
signs
in
the
sun
and
in
the
moon
and
in
the
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of
nations
with
perplexity
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring
21
26
men’s
hearts
failing
them
for
fear
and
for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming
on
the
earth
for
the
powers
of
heaven
shall
be
shaken
21
27
and
then
shall
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
glory
21
28
and
when
these
things
begin
to
come
to
pass
then
look
up
and
lift
up
your
heads
for
your
redemption
draweth
nigh
21
29
and
he
spake
to
them
a
parable
behold
the
fig
tree
and
all
the
trees
21
30
when
they
now
shoot
forth
ye
see
and
know
of
your
own
selves
that
summer
is
now
nigh
at
hand
21
31
so
likewise
ye
when
ye
see
these
things
come
to
pass
know
ye
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
nigh
at
hand
21
32
verily
i
say
unto
you
this
generation
shall
not
pass
away
till
all
be
fulfilled
21
33
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away
21
34
and
take
heed
to
yourselves
lest
at
any
time
your
hearts
be
overcharged
with
surfeiting
and
drunkenness
and
cares
of
this
life
and
so
that
day
come
upon
you
unawares
21
35
for
as
a
snare
shall
it
come
on
all
them
that
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
21
36
watch
ye
therefore
and
pray
always
that
ye
may
be
accounted
worthy
to
escape
all
these
things
that
shall
come
to
pass
and
to
stand
before
the
son
of
man
21
37
and
in
the
day
time
he
was
teaching
in
the
temple
and
at
night
he
went
out
and
abode
in
the
mount
that
is
called
the
mount
of
olives
21
38
and
all
the
people
came
early
in
the
morning
to
him
in
the
temple
for
to
hear
him
22
1
now
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
drew
nigh
which
is
called
the
passover
22
2
and
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
sought
how
they
might
kill
him
for
they
feared
the
people
22
3
then
entered
satan
into
judas
surnamed
iscariot
being
of
the
number
of
the
twelve
22
4
and
he
went
his
way
and
communed
with
the
chief
priests
and
captains
how
he
might
betray
him
unto
them
22
5
and
they
were
glad
and
covenanted
to
give
him
money
22
6
and
he
promised
and
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
unto
them
in
the
absence
of
the
multitude
22
7
then
came
the
day
of
unleavened
bread
when
the
passover
must
be
killed
22
8
and
he
sent
peter
and
john
saying
go
and
prepare
us
the
passover
that
we
may
eat
22
9
and
they
said
unto
him
where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare
22
10
and
he
said
unto
them
behold
when
ye
are
entered
into
the
city
there
shall
a
man
meet
you
bearing
a
pitcher
of
water
follow
him
into
the
house
where
he
entereth
in
22
11
and
ye
shall
say
unto
the
goodman
of
the
house
the
master
saith
unto
thee
where
is
the
guestchamber
where
i
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
disciples
22
12
and
he
shall
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
furnished
there
make
ready
22
13
and
they
went
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
22
14
and
when
the
hour
was
come
he
sat
down
and
the
twelve
apostles
with
him
22
15
and
he
said
unto
them
with
desire
i
have
desired
to
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
i
suffer
22
16
for
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
any
more
eat
thereof
until
it
be
fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
of
god
22
17
and
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
said
take
this
and
divide
it
among
yourselves
22
18
for
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
come
22
19
and
he
took
bread
and
gave
thanks
and
brake
it
and
gave
unto
them
saying
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
22
20
likewise
also
the
cup
after
supper
saying
this
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood
which
is
shed
for
you
22
21
but
behold
the
hand
of
him
that
betrayeth
me
is
with
me
on
the
table
22
22
and
truly
the
son
of
man
goeth
as
it
was
determined
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
he
is
betrayed
22
23
and
they
began
to
enquire
among
themselves
which
of
them
it
was
that
should
do
this
thing
22
24
and
there
was
also
a
strife
among
them
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
the
greatest
22
25
and
he
said
unto
them
the
kings
of
the
gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
them
and
they
that
exercise
authority
upon
them
are
called
benefactors
22
26
but
ye
shall
not
be
so
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
let
him
be
as
the
younger
and
he
that
is
chief
as
he
that
doth
serve
22
27
for
whether
is
greater
he
that
sitteth
at
meat
or
he
that
serveth
is
not
he
that
sitteth
at
meat
but
i
am
among
you
as
he
that
serveth
22
28
ye
are
they
which
have
continued
with
me
in
my
temptations
22
29
and
i
appoint
unto
you
a
kingdom
as
my
father
hath
appointed
unto
me
22
30
that
ye
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
kingdom
and
sit
on
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
22
31
and
the
lord
said
simon
simon
behold
satan
hath
desired
to
have
you
that
he
may
sift
you
as
wheat
22
32
but
i
have
prayed
for
thee
that
thy
faith
fail
not
and
when
thou
art
converted
strengthen
thy
brethren
22
33
and
he
said
unto
him
lord
i
am
ready
to
go
with
thee
both
into
prison
and
to
death
22
34
and
he
said
i
tell
thee
peter
the
cock
shall
not
crow
this
day
before
that
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
me
22
35
and
he
said
unto
them
when
i
sent
you
without
purse
and
scrip
and
shoes
lacked
ye
any
thing
and
they
said
nothing
22
36
then
said
he
unto
them
but
now
he
that
hath
a
purse
let
him
take
it
and
likewise
his
scrip
and
he
that
hath
no
sword
let
him
sell
his
garment
and
buy
one
22
37
for
i
say
unto
you
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
accomplished
in
me
and
he
was
reckoned
among
the
transgressors
for
the
things
concerning
me
have
an
end
22
38
and
they
said
lord
behold
here
are
two
swords
and
he
said
unto
them
it
is
enough
22
39
and
he
came
out
and
went
as
he
was
wont
to
the
mount
of
olives
and
his
disciples
also
followed
him
22
40
and
when
he
was
at
the
place
he
said
unto
them
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
22
41
and
he
was
withdrawn
from
them
about
a
stone’s
cast
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
22
42
saying
father
if
thou
be
willing
remove
this
cup
from
me
nevertheless
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
22
43
and
there
appeared
an
angel
unto
him
from
heaven
strengthening
him
22
44
and
being
in
an
agony
he
prayed
more
earnestly
and
his
sweat
was
as
it
were
great
drops
of
blood
falling
down
to
the
ground
22
45
and
when
he
rose
up
from
prayer
and
was
come
to
his
disciples
he
found
them
sleeping
for
sorrow
22
46
and
said
unto
them
why
sleep
ye
rise
and
pray
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation
22
47
and
while
he
yet
spake
behold
a
multitude
and
he
that
was
called
judas
one
of
the
twelve
went
before
them
and
drew
near
unto
jesus
to
kiss
him
22
48
but
jesus
said
unto
him
judas
betrayest
thou
the
son
of
man
with
a
kiss
22
49
when
they
which
were
about
him
saw
what
would
follow
they
said
unto
him
lord
shall
we
smite
with
the
sword
22
50
and
one
of
them
smote
the
servant
of
the
high
priest
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
22
51
and
jesus
answered
and
said
suffer
ye
thus
far
and
he
touched
his
ear
and
healed
him
22
52
then
jesus
said
unto
the
chief
priests
and
captains
of
the
temple
and
the
elders
which
were
come
to
him
be
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
staves
22
53
when
i
was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple
ye
stretched
forth
no
hands
against
me
but
this
is
your
hour
and
the
power
of
darkness
22
54
then
took
they
him
and
led
him
and
brought
him
into
the
high
priest’s
house
and
peter
followed
afar
off
22
55
and
when
they
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
and
were
set
down
together
peter
sat
down
among
them
22
56
but
a
certain
maid
beheld
him
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
earnestly
looked
upon
him
and
said
this
man
was
also
with
him
22
57
and
he
denied
him
saying
woman
i
know
him
not
22
58
and
after
a
little
while
another
saw
him
and
said
thou
art
also
of
them
and
peter
said
man
i
am
not
22
59
and
about
the
space
of
one
hour
after
another
confidently
affirmed
saying
of
a
truth
this
fellow
also
was
with
him
for
he
is
a
galilaean
22
60
and
peter
said
man
i
know
not
what
thou
sayest
and
immediately
while
he
yet
spake
the
cock
crew
22
61
and
the
lord
turned
and
looked
upon
peter
and
peter
remembered
the
word
of
the
lord
how
he
had
said
unto
him
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
22
62
and
peter
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
22
63
and
the
men
that
held
jesus
mocked
him
and
smote
him
22
64
and
when
they
had
blindfolded
him
they
struck
him
on
the
face
and
asked
him
saying
prophesy
who
is
it
that
smote
thee
22
65
and
many
other
things
blasphemously
spake
they
against
him
22
66
and
as
soon
as
it
was
day
the
elders
of
the
people
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
together
and
led
him
into
their
council
saying
22
67
art
thou
the
christ
tell
us
and
he
said
unto
them
if
i
tell
you
ye
will
not
believe
22
68
and
if
i
also
ask
you
ye
will
not
answer
me
nor
let
me
go
22
69
hereafter
shall
the
son
of
man
sit
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
god
22
70
then
said
they
all
art
thou
then
the
son
of
god
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
say
that
i
am
22
71
and
they
said
what
need
we
any
further
witness
for
we
ourselves
have
heard
of
his
own
mouth
23
1
and
the
whole
multitude
of
them
arose
and
led
him
unto
pilate
23
2
and
they
began
to
accuse
him
saying
we
found
this
fellow
perverting
the
nation
and
forbidding
to
give
tribute
to
caesar
saying
that
he
himself
is
christ
a
king
23
3
and
pilate
asked
him
saying
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
and
he
answered
him
and
said
thou
sayest
it
23
4
then
said
pilate
to
the
chief
priests
and
to
the
people
i
find
no
fault
in
this
man
23
5
and
they
were
the
more
fierce
saying
he
stirreth
up
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
jewry
beginning
from
galilee
to
this
place
23
6
when
pilate
heard
of
galilee
he
asked
whether
the
man
were
a
galilaean
23
7
and
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
belonged
unto
herod’s
jurisdiction
he
sent
him
to
herod
who
himself
also
was
at
jerusalem
at
that
time
23
8
and
when
herod
saw
jesus
he
was
exceeding
glad
for
he
was
desirous
to
see
him
of
a
long
season
because
he
had
heard
many
things
of
him
and
he
hoped
to
have
seen
some
miracle
done
by
him
23
9
then
he
questioned
with
him
in
many
words
but
he
answered
him
nothing
23
10
and
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
stood
and
vehemently
accused
him
23
11
and
herod
with
his
men
of
war
set
him
at
nought
and
mocked
him
and
arrayed
him
in
a
gorgeous
robe
and
sent
him
again
to
pilate
23
12
and
the
same
day
pilate
and
herod
were
made
friends
together
for
before
they
were
at
enmity
between
themselves
23
13
and
pilate
when
he
had
called
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
23
14
said
unto
them
ye
have
brought
this
man
unto
me
as
one
that
perverteth
the
people
and
behold
i
having
examined
him
before
you
have
found
no
fault
in
this
man
touching
those
things
whereof
ye
accuse
him
23
15
no
nor
yet
herod
for
i
sent
you
to
him
and
lo
nothing
worthy
of
death
is
done
unto
him
23
16
i
will
therefore
chastise
him
and
release
him
23
17
(for
of
necessity
he
must
release
one
unto
them
at
the
feast
)
23
18
and
they
cried
out
all
at
once
saying
away
with
this
man
and
release
unto
us
barabbas
23
19
(who
for
a
certain
sedition
made
in
the
city
and
for
murder
was
cast
into
prison
)
23
20
pilate
therefore
willing
to
release
jesus
spake
again
to
them
23
21
but
they
cried
saying
crucify
him
crucify
him
23
22
and
he
said
unto
them
the
third
time
why
what
evil
hath
he
done
i
have
found
no
cause
of
death
in
him
i
will
therefore
chastise
him
and
let
him
go
23
23
and
they
were
instant
with
loud
voices
requiring
that
he
might
be
crucified
and
the
voices
of
them
and
of
the
chief
priests
prevailed
23
24
and
pilate
gave
sentence
that
it
should
be
as
they
required
23
25
and
he
released
unto
them
him
that
for
sedition
and
murder
was
cast
into
prison
whom
they
had
desired
but
he
delivered
jesus
to
their
will
23
26
and
as
they
led
him
away
they
laid
hold
upon
one
simon
a
cyrenian
coming
out
of
the
country
and
on
him
they
laid
the
cross
that
he
might
bear
it
after
jesus
23
27
and
there
followed
him
a
great
company
of
people
and
of
women
which
also
bewailed
and
lamented
him
23
28
but
jesus
turning
unto
them
said
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
for
your
children
23
29
for
behold
the
days
are
coming
in
the
which
they
shall
say
blessed
are
the
barren
and
the
wombs
that
never
bare
and
the
paps
which
never
gave
suck
23
30
then
shall
they
begin
to
say
to
the
mountains
fall
on
us
and
to
the
hills
cover
us
23
31
for
if
they
do
these
things
in
a
green
tree
what
shall
be
done
in
the
dry
23
32
and
there
were
also
two
other
malefactors
led
with
him
to
be
put
to
death
23
33
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
place
which
is
called
calvary
there
they
crucified
him
and
the
malefactors
one
on
the
right
hand
and
the
other
on
the
left
23
34
then
said
jesus
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
and
they
parted
his
raiment
and
cast
lots
23
35
and
the
people
stood
beholding
and
the
rulers
also
with
them
derided
him
saying
he
saved
others
let
him
save
himself
if
he
be
christ
the
chosen
of
god
23
36
and
the
soldiers
also
mocked
him
coming
to
him
and
offering
him
vinegar
23
37
and
saying
if
thou
be
the
king
of
the
jews
save
thyself
23
38
and
a
superscription
also
was
written
over
him
in
letters
of
greek
and
latin
and
hebrew
this
is
the
king
of
the
jews
23
39
and
one
of
the
malefactors
which
were
hanged
railed
on
him
saying
if
thou
be
christ
save
thyself
and
us
23
40
but
the
other
answering
rebuked
him
saying
dost
not
thou
fear
god
seeing
thou
art
in
the
same
condemnation
23
41
and
we
indeed
justly
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
deeds
but
this
man
hath
done
nothing
amiss
23
42
and
he
said
unto
jesus
lord
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom
23
43
and
jesus
said
unto
him
verily
i
say
unto
thee
to
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
23
44
and
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour
and
there
was
a
darkness
over
all
the
earth
until
the
ninth
hour
23
45
and
the
sun
was
darkened
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
the
midst
23
46
and
when
jesus
had
cried
with
a
loud
voice
he
said
father
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
and
having
said
thus
he
gave
up
the
ghost
23
47
now
when
the
centurion
saw
what
was
done
he
glorified
god
saying
certainly
this
was
a
righteous
man
23
48
and
all
the
people
that
came
together
to
that
sight
beholding
the
things
which
were
done
smote
their
breasts
and
returned
23
49
and
all
his
acquaintance
and
the
women
that
followed
him
from
galilee
stood
afar
off
beholding
these
things
23
50
and
behold
there
was
a
man
named
joseph
a
counsellor
and
he
was
a
good
man
and
a
just
23
51
(the
same
had
not
consented
to
the
counsel
and
deed
of
them
)
he
was
of
arimathaea
a
city
of
the
jews
who
also
himself
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
god
23
52
this
man
went
unto
pilate
and
begged
the
body
of
jesus
23
53
and
he
took
it
down
and
wrapped
it
in
linen
and
laid
it
in
a
sepulchre
that
was
hewn
in
stone
wherein
never
man
before
was
laid
23
54
and
that
day
was
the
preparation
and
the
sabbath
drew
on
23
55
and
the
women
also
which
came
with
him
from
galilee
followed
after
and
beheld
the
sepulchre
and
how
his
body
was
laid
23
56
and
they
returned
and
prepared
spices
and
ointments
and
rested
the
sabbath
day
according
to
the
commandment
24
1
now
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
very
early
in
the
morning
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
bringing
the
spices
which
they
had
prepared
and
certain
others
with
them
24
2
and
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
sepulchre
24
3
and
they
entered
in
and
found
not
the
body
of
the
lord
jesus
24
4
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
were
much
perplexed
thereabout
behold
two
men
stood
by
them
in
shining
garments
24
5
and
as
they
were
afraid
and
bowed
down
their
faces
to
the
earth
they
said
unto
them
why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
dead
24
6
he
is
not
here
but
is
risen
remember
how
he
spake
unto
you
when
he
was
yet
in
galilee
24
7
saying
the
son
of
man
must
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinful
men
and
be
crucified
and
the
third
day
rise
again
24
8
and
they
remembered
his
words
24
9
and
returned
from
the
sepulchre
and
told
all
these
things
unto
the
eleven
and
to
all
the
rest
24
10
it
was
mary
magdalene
and
joanna
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
other
women
that
were
with
them
which
told
these
things
unto
the
apostles
24
11
and
their
words
seemed
to
them
as
idle
tales
and
they
believed
them
not
24
12
then
arose
peter
and
ran
unto
the
sepulchre
and
stooping
down
he
beheld
the
linen
clothes
laid
by
themselves
and
departed
wondering
in
himself
at
that
which
was
come
to
pass
24
13
and
behold
two
of
them
went
that
same
day
to
a
village
called
emmaus
which
was
from
jerusalem
about
threescore
furlongs
24
14
and
they
talked
together
of
all
these
things
which
had
happened
24
15
and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
communed
together
and
reasoned
jesus
himself
drew
near
and
went
with
them
24
16
but
their
eyes
were
holden
that
they
should
not
know
him
24
17
and
he
said
unto
them
what
manner
of
communications
are
these
that
ye
have
one
to
another
as
ye
walk
and
are
sad
24
18
and
the
one
of
them
whose
name
was
cleopas
answering
said
unto
him
art
thou
only
a
stranger
in
jerusalem
and
hast
not
known
the
things
which
are
come
to
pass
there
in
these
days
24
19
and
he
said
unto
them
what
things
and
they
said
unto
him
concerning
jesus
of
nazareth
which
was
a
prophet
mighty
in
deed
and
word
before
god
and
all
the
people
24
20
and
how
the
chief
priests
and
our
rulers
delivered
him
to
be
condemned
to
death
and
have
crucified
him
24
21
but
we
trusted
that
it
had
been
he
which
should
have
redeemed
israel
and
beside
all
this
to
day
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
were
done
24
22
yea
and
certain
women
also
of
our
company
made
us
astonished
which
were
early
at
the
sepulchre
24
23
and
when
they
found
not
his
body
they
came
saying
that
they
had
also
seen
a
vision
of
angels
which
said
that
he
was
alive
24
24
and
certain
of
them
which
were
with
us
went
to
the
sepulchre
and
found
it
even
so
as
the
women
had
said
but
him
they
saw
not
24
25
then
he
said
unto
them
o
fools
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
spoken
24
26
ought
not
christ
to
have
suffered
these
things
and
to
enter
into
his
glory
24
27
and
beginning
at
moses
and
all
the
prophets
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
himself
24
28
and
they
drew
nigh
unto
the
village
whither
they
went
and
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
gone
further
24
29
but
they
constrained
him
saying
abide
with
us
for
it
is
toward
evening
and
the
day
is
far
spent
and
he
went
in
to
tarry
with
them
24
30
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
sat
at
meat
with
them
he
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
and
gave
to
them
24
31
and
their
eyes
were
opened
and
they
knew
him
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
sight
24
32
and
they
said
one
to
another
did
not
our
heart
burn
within
us
while
he
talked
with
us
by
the
way
and
while
he
opened
to
us
the
scriptures
24
33
and
they
rose
up
the
same
hour
and
returned
to
jerusalem
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
together
and
them
that
were
with
them
24
34
saying
the
lord
is
risen
indeed
and
hath
appeared
to
simon
24
35
and
they
told
what
things
were
done
in
the
way
and
how
he
was
known
of
them
in
breaking
of
bread
24
36
and
as
they
thus
spake
jesus
himself
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
saith
unto
them
peace
be
unto
you
24
37
but
they
were
terrified
and
affrighted
and
supposed
that
they
had
seen
a
spirit
24
38
and
he
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
troubled
and
why
do
thoughts
arise
in
your
hearts
24
39
behold
my
hands
and
my
feet
that
it
is
i
myself
handle
me
and
see
for
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones
as
ye
see
me
have
24
40
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
shewed
them
his
hands
and
his
feet
24
41
and
while
they
yet
believed
not
for
joy
and
wondered
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
here
any
meat
24
42
and
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
broiled
fish
and
of
an
honeycomb
24
43
and
he
took
it
and
did
eat
before
them
24
44
and
he
said
unto
them
these
are
the
words
which
i
spake
unto
you
while
i
was
yet
with
you
that
all
things
must
be
fulfilled
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
moses
and
in
the
prophets
and
in
the
psalms
concerning
me
24
45
then
opened
he
their
understanding
that
they
might
understand
the
scriptures
24
46
and
said
unto
them
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behoved
christ
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
day
24
47
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
nations
beginning
at
jerusalem
24
48
and
ye
are
witnesses
of
these
things
24
49
and
behold
i
send
the
promise
of
my
father
upon
you
but
tarry
ye
in
the
city
of
jerusalem
until
ye
be
endued
with
power
from
on
high
24
50
and
he
led
them
out
as
far
as
to
bethany
and
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
blessed
them
24
51
and
it
came
to
pass
while
he
blessed
them
he
was
parted
from
them
and
carried
up
into
heaven
24
52
and
they
worshipped
him
and
returned
to
jerusalem
with
great
joy
24
53
and
were
continually
in
the
temple
praising
and
blessing
god
amen
the
gospel
according
to
saint
john
1
1
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
1
2
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
1
3
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
any
thing
made
that
was
made
1
4
in
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
1
5
and
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
1
6
there
was
a
man
sent
from
god
whose
name
was
john
1
7
the
same
came
for
a
witness
to
bear
witness
of
the
light
that
all
men
through
him
might
believe
1
8
he
was
not
that
light
but
was
sent
to
bear
witness
of
that
light
1
9
that
was
the
true
light
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
1
10
he
was
in
the
world
and
the
world
was
made
by
him
and
the
world
knew
him
not
1
11
he
came
unto
his
own
and
his
own
received
him
not
1
12
but
as
many
as
received
him
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
god
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
1
13
which
were
born
not
of
blood
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
nor
of
the
will
of
man
but
of
god
1
14
and
the
word
was
made
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
(and
we
beheld
his
glory
the
glory
as
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
)
full
of
grace
and
truth
1
15
john
bare
witness
of
him
and
cried
saying
this
was
he
of
whom
i
spake
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
preferred
before
me
for
he
was
before
me
1
16
and
of
his
fulness
have
all
we
received
and
grace
for
grace
1
17
for
the
law
was
given
by
moses
but
grace
and
truth
came
by
jesus
christ
1
18
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
the
only
begotten
son
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
hath
declared
him
1
19
and
this
is
the
record
of
john
when
the
jews
sent
priests
and
levites
from
jerusalem
to
ask
him
who
art
thou
1
20
and
he
confessed
and
denied
not
but
confessed
i
am
not
the
christ
1
21
and
they
asked
him
what
then
art
thou
elias
and
he
saith
i
am
not
art
thou
that
prophet
and
he
answered
no
1
22
then
said
they
unto
him
who
art
thou
that
we
may
give
an
answer
to
them
that
sent
us
what
sayest
thou
of
thyself
1
23
he
said
i
am
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
make
straight
the
way
of
the
lord
as
said
the
prophet
esaias
1
24
and
they
which
were
sent
were
of
the
pharisees
1
25
and
they
asked
him
and
said
unto
him
why
baptizest
thou
then
if
thou
be
not
that
christ
nor
elias
neither
that
prophet
1
26
john
answered
them
saying
i
baptize
with
water
but
there
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
1
27
he
it
is
who
coming
after
me
is
preferred
before
me
whose
shoe’s
latchet
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
1
28
these
things
were
done
in
bethabara
beyond
jordan
where
john
was
baptizing
1
29
the
next
day
john
seeth
jesus
coming
unto
him
and
saith
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
1
30
this
is
he
of
whom
i
said
after
me
cometh
a
man
which
is
preferred
before
me
for
he
was
before
me
1
31
and
i
knew
him
not
but
that
he
should
be
made
manifest
to
israel
therefore
am
i
come
baptizing
with
water
1
32
and
john
bare
record
saying
i
saw
the
spirit
descending
from
heaven
like
a
dove
and
it
abode
upon
him
1
33
and
i
knew
him
not
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water
the
same
said
unto
me
upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
on
him
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
holy
ghost
1
34
and
i
saw
and
bare
record
that
this
is
the
son
of
god
1
35
again
the
next
day
after
john
stood
and
two
of
his
disciples
1
36
and
looking
upon
jesus
as
he
walked
he
saith
behold
the
lamb
of
god
1
37
and
the
two
disciples
heard
him
speak
and
they
followed
jesus
1
38
then
jesus
turned
and
saw
them
following
and
saith
unto
them
what
seek
ye
they
said
unto
him
rabbi
(which
is
to
say
being
interpreted
master
)
where
dwellest
thou
1
39
he
saith
unto
them
come
and
see
they
came
and
saw
where
he
dwelt
and
abode
with
him
that
day
for
it
was
about
the
tenth
hour
1
40
one
of
the
two
which
heard
john
speak
and
followed
him
was
andrew
simon
peter’s
brother
1
41
he

brother
simon
and
saith
unto
him
we
have
found
the
messias
which
is
being
interpreted
the
christ
1
42
and
he
brought
him
to
jesus
and
when
jesus
beheld
him
he
said
thou
art
simon
the
son
of
jona
thou
shalt
be
called
cephas
which
is
by
interpretation
a
stone
1
43
the
day
following
jesus
would
go
forth
into
galilee
and
findeth
philip
and
saith
unto
him

of
whom
moses
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
did
write
jesus
of
nazareth
the
son
of
joseph
1
46
and
nathanael
said
unto
him

saith
unto
him

him
and
saith
of

in
whom

no
guile
1
48
nathanael
saith
unto
him
whence
knowest
thou
me
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
before
that
philip
called
thee
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
tree
i
saw
thee
1
49
nathanael
answered
and
saith
unto
him
rabbi
thou
art
the
son
of
god
thou
art
the
king
of
israel
1
50
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
because
i
said
unto
thee
i
saw
thee
under
the
fig
tree
believest
thou
thou
shalt
see
greater
things
than
these
1
51
and
he
saith
unto
him
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
hereafter
ye
shall
see
heaven
open
and
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
upon

son
of
man

wanted
wine
the
mother
of
jesus
saith
unto
him
they
have
no
wine
2
4
jesus
saith
unto
her
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
mine
hour
is
not
yet
come
2
5
his
mother
saith
unto
the
servants
whatsoever
he
saith
unto
you
do
it
2
6
and
there
were
set
there
six
waterpots
of
stone
after
the
manner
of
the
purifying
of
the
jews
containing
two
or
three
firkins
apiece
2
7
jesus
saith
unto
them
fill
the
waterpots
with
water
and
they
filled
them
up
to
the
brim
2
8
and
he
saith
unto
them
draw
out
now
and
bear
unto
the
governor
of
the
feast
and
they
bare
it
2
9
when
the
ruler
of
the
feast
had
tasted
the
water
that
was
made
wine
and
knew
not
whence
it
was
(but
the
servants
which
drew
the
water
knew
)
the
governor
of
the
feast
called
the
bridegroom
2
10
and
saith
unto
him
every
man
at
the
beginning
doth
set
forth
good
wine
and
when
men
have
well
drunk
then
that
which
is
worse
but
thou
hast
kept
the
good
wine
until
now
2
11
this
beginning
of
miracles
did
jesus
in
cana
of
galilee
and
manifested
forth
his
glory
and
his
disciples
believed
on
him
2
12
after
this
he
went
down
to
capernaum
he
and
his
mother
and
his
brethren
and
his
disciples
and
they
continued
there
not
many
days
2
13
and
the
jews’
passover
was
at
hand
and
jesus
went
up
to
jerusalem
2
14
and
found
in
the
temple
those
that
sold
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
changers
of
money
sitting
2
15
and
when
he
had
made
a
scourge
of
small
cords
he
drove
them
all
out
of
the
temple
and
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
poured
out
the
changers’
money
and
overthrew
the
tables
2
16
and
said
unto
them
that
sold
doves
take
these
things
hence
make
not
my
father’s
house
an
house
of
merchandise
2
17
and
his
disciples
remembered
that
it
was
written
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up
2
18
then
answered
the
jews
and
said
unto
him
what
sign
shewest
thou
unto
us
seeing
that
thou
doest
these
things
2
19
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
destroy
this
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
2
20
then
said
the
jews
forty
and
six
years
was
this
temple
in
building
and
wilt
thou
rear
it
up
in
three
days
2
21
but
he
spake
of
the
temple
of
his
body
2
22
when
therefore
he
was
risen
from
the
dead
his
disciples
remembered
that
he
had
said
this
unto
them
and
they
believed
the
scripture
and
the
word
which
jesus
had
said
2
23
now
when
he
was
in
jerusalem
at
the
passover
in
the
feast
day
many
believed
in
his
name
when
they
saw
the
miracles
which
he
did
2
24
but
jesus
did
not
commit
himself
unto
them
because
he
knew
all
men
2
25
and
needed
not
that
any
should
testify
of
man
for
he
knew
what
was
in
man
3
1
there
was
a
man
of
the
pharisees
named
nicodemus
a
ruler
of
the
jews
3
2
the
same
came
to
jesus
by
night
and
said
unto
him
rabbi
we
know
that
thou
art
a
teacher
come
from
god
for
no
man
can
do
these
miracles
that
thou
doest
except
god
be
with
him
3
3
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
except
a
man
be
born
again
he
cannot
see
the
kingdom
of
god
3
4
nicodemus
saith
unto
him
how
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
old
can
he
enter
the
second
time
into
his
mother’s
womb
and
be
born
3
5
jesus
answered
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
cannot
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
3
6
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
3
7
marvel
not
that
i
said
unto
thee
ye
must
be
born
again
3
8
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
thereof
but
canst
not
tell
whence
it
cometh
and
whither
it
goeth
so
is
every
one
that
is
born
of
the
spirit
3
9
nicodemus
answered
and
said
unto
him
how
can
these
things
be
3
10
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
a
master
of
israel
and
knowest
not
these
things
3
11
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
we
speak
that
we
do
know
and
testify
that
we
have
seen
and
ye
receive
not
our
witness
3
12
if
i
have
told
you
earthly
things
and
ye
believe
not
how
shall
ye
believe
if
i
tell
you
of
heavenly
things
3
13
and
no
man
hath
ascended
up
to
heaven
but
he
that
came
down
from
heaven
even
the
son
of
man
which
is
in
heaven
3
14
and
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
so
must
the
son
of
man
be
lifted
up
3
15
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
3
16
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
3
17
for
god
sent
not
his
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
saved
3
18
he
that
believeth
on
him
is
not
condemned
but
he
that
believeth
not
is
condemned
already
because
he
hath
not
believed
in
the
name
of
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
3
19
and
this
is
the
condemnation
that
light
is
come
into
the
world
and
men
loved
darkness
rather
than
light
because
their
deeds
were
evil
3
20
for
every
one
that
doeth
evil
hateth
the
light
neither
cometh
to
the
light
lest
his
deeds
should
be
reproved
3
21
but
he
that
doeth
truth
cometh
to
the
light
that
his
deeds
may
be
made
manifest
that
they
are
wrought
in
god
3
22
after
these
things
came
jesus
and
his
disciples
into
the
land
of
judaea
and
there
he
tarried
with
them
and
baptized
3
23
and
john
also
was
baptizing
in
aenon
near
to
salim
because
there
was
much
water
there
and
they
came
and
were
baptized
3
24
for
john
was
not
yet
cast
into
prison
3
25
then
there
arose
a
question
between
some
of
john’s
disciples
and
the
jews
about
purifying
3
26
and
they
came
unto
john
and
said
unto
him
rabbi
he
that
was
with
thee
beyond
jordan
to
whom
thou
barest
witness
behold
the
same
baptizeth
and
all
men
come
to
him
3
27
john
answered
and
said
a
man
can
receive
nothing
except
it
be
given
him
from
heaven
3
28
ye
yourselves
bear
me
witness
that
i
said
i
am
not
the
christ
but
that
i
am
sent
before
him
3
29
he
that
hath
the
bride
is
the
bridegroom
but
the
friend
of
the
bridegroom
which
standeth
and
heareth
him
rejoiceth
greatly
because
of
the
bridegroom’s
voice
this
my
joy
therefore
is
fulfilled
3
30
he
must
increase
but
i
must
decrease
3
31
he
that
cometh
from
above
is
above
all
he
that
is
of
the
earth
is
earthly
and
speaketh
of
the
earth
he
that
cometh
from
heaven
is
above
all
3
32
and
what
he
hath
seen
and
heard
that
he
testifieth
and
no
man
receiveth
his
testimony
3
33
he
that
hath
received
his
testimony
hath
set
to
his
seal
that
god
is
true
3
34
for
he
whom
god
hath
sent
speaketh
the
words
of
god
for
god
giveth
not
the
spirit
by
measure
unto
him
3
35
the
father
loveth
the
son
and
hath
given
all
things
into
his
hand
3
36
he
that
believeth
on
the
son
hath
everlasting
life
and
he
that
believeth
not
the
son
shall
not
see
life
but
the
wrath
of
god
abideth
on
him
4
1
when
therefore
the
lord
knew
how
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
jesus
made
and
baptized
more
disciples
than
john
4
2
(though
jesus
himself
baptized
not
but
his
disciples
)
4
3
he
left
judaea
and
departed
again
into
galilee
4
4
and
he
must
needs
go
through
samaria
4
5
then
cometh
he
to
a
city
of
samaria
which
is
called
sychar
near
to
the
parcel
of
ground
that
jacob
gave
to
his
son
joseph
4
6
now
jacob’s
well
was
there
jesus
therefore
being
wearied
with
his
journey
sat
thus
on
the
well
and
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour
4
7
there
cometh
a
woman
of
samaria
to
draw
water
jesus
saith
unto
her
give
me
to
drink
4
8
(for
his
disciples
were
gone
away
unto
the
city
to
buy
meat
)
4
9
then
saith
the
woman
of
samaria
unto
him
how
is
it
that
thou
being
a
jew
askest
drink
of
me
which
am
a
woman
of
samaria
for
the
jews
have
no
dealings
with
the
samaritans
4
10
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
if
thou
knewest
the
gift
of
god
and
who
it
is
that
saith
to
thee
give
me
to
drink
thou
wouldest
have
asked
of
him
and
he
would
have
given
thee
living
water
4
11
the
woman
saith
unto
him
sir
thou
hast
nothing
to
draw
with
and
the
well
is
deep
from
whence
then
hast
thou
that
living
water
4
12
art
thou
greater
than
our
father
jacob
which
gave
us
the
well
and
drank
thereof
himself
and
his
children
and
his
cattle
4
13
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
whosoever
drinketh
of
this
water
shall
thirst
again
4
14
but
whosoever
drinketh
of
the
water
that
i
shall
give
him
shall
never
thirst
but
the
water
that
i
shall
give
him
shall
be
in
him
a
well
of
water
springing
up
into
everlasting
life
4
15
the
woman
saith
unto
him
sir
give
me
this
water
that
i
thirst
not
neither
come
hither
to
draw
4
16
jesus
saith
unto
her
go
call
thy
husband
and
come
hither
4
17
the
woman
answered
and
said
i
have
no
husband
jesus
said
unto
her
thou
hast
well
said
i
have
no
husband
4
18
for
thou
hast
had
five
husbands
and
he
whom
thou
now
hast
is
not
thy
husband
in
that
saidst
thou
truly
4
19
the
woman
saith
unto
him
sir
i
perceive
that
thou
art
a
prophet
4
20
our
fathers
worshipped
in
this
mountain
and
ye
say
that
in
jerusalem
is
the
place
where
men
ought
to
worship
4
21
jesus
saith
unto
her
woman
believe
me
the
hour
cometh
when
ye
shall
neither
in
this
mountain
nor
yet
at
jerusalem
worship
the
father
4
22
ye
worship
ye
know
not
what
we
know
what
we
worship
for
salvation
is
of
the
jews
4
23
but
the
hour
cometh
and
now
is
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
for
the
father
seeketh
such
to
worship
him
4
24
god
is
a
spirit
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
4
25
the
woman
saith
unto
him
i
know
that
messias
cometh
which
is
called
christ
when
he
is
come
he
will
tell
us
all
things
4
26
jesus
saith
unto
her
i
that
speak
unto
thee
am
he
4
27
and
upon
this
came
his
disciples
and
marvelled
that
he
talked
with
the
woman
yet
no
man
said
what
seekest
thou
or
why
talkest
thou
with
her
4
28
the
woman
then
left
her
waterpot
and
went
her
way
into
the
city
and
saith
to
the
men
4
29
come
see
a
man
which
told
me
all
things
that
ever
i
did
is
not
this
the
christ
4
30
then
they
went
out
of
the
city
and
came
unto
him
4
31
in
the
mean
while
his
disciples
prayed
him
saying
master
eat
4
32
but
he
said
unto
them
i
have
meat
to
eat
that
ye
know
not
of
4
33
therefore
said
the
disciples
one
to
another
hath
any
man
brought
him
ought
to
eat
4
34
jesus
saith
unto
them
my
meat
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
and
to
finish
his
work
4
35
say
not
ye
there
are
yet
four
months
and
then
cometh
harvest
behold
i
say
unto
you
lift
up
your
eyes
and
look
on
the
fields
for
they
are
white
already
to
harvest
4
36
and
he
that
reapeth
receiveth
wages
and
gathereth
fruit
unto
life
eternal
that
both
he
that
soweth
and
he
that
reapeth
may
rejoice
together
4
37
and
herein
is
that
saying
true
one
soweth
and
another
reapeth
4
38
i
sent
you
to
reap
that
whereon
ye
bestowed
no
labour
other
men
laboured
and
ye
are
entered
into
their
labours
4
39
and
many
of
the
samaritans
of
that
city
believed
on
him
for
the
saying
of
the
woman
which
testified
he
told
me
all
that
ever
i
did
4
40
so
when
the
samaritans
were
come
unto
him
they
besought
him
that
he
would
tarry
with
them
and
he
abode
there
two
days
4
41
and
many
more
believed
because
of
his
own
word
4
42
and
said
unto
the
woman
now
we
believe
not
because
of
thy
saying
for
we
have
heard
him
ourselves
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
christ
the
saviour
of
the
world
4
43
now
after
two
days
he
departed
thence
and
went
into
galilee
4
44
for
jesus
himself
testified
that
a
prophet
hath
no
honour
in
his
own
country
4
45
then
when
he
was
come
into
galilee
the
galilaeans
received
him
having
seen
all
the
things
that
he
did
at
jerusalem
at
the
feast
for
they
also
went
unto
the
feast
4
46
so
jesus
came
again
into
cana
of
galilee
where
he
made
the
water
wine
and
there
was
a
certain
nobleman
whose
son
was
sick
at
capernaum
4
47
when
he
heard
that
jesus
was
come
out
of
judaea
into
galilee
he
went
unto
him
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
down
and
heal
his
son
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
death
4
48
then
said
jesus
unto
him
except
ye
see
signs
and
wonders
ye
will
not
believe
4
49
the
nobleman
saith
unto
him
sir
come
down
ere
my
child
die
4
50
jesus
saith
unto
him
go
thy
way
thy
son
liveth
and
the
man
believed
the
word
that
jesus
had
spoken
unto
him
and
he
went
his
way
4
51
and
as
he
was
now
going
down
his
servants
met
him
and
told
him
saying
thy
son
liveth
4
52
then
enquired
he
of
them
the
hour
when
he
began
to
amend
and
they
said
unto
him
yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
him
4
53
so
the
father
knew
that
it
was
at
the
same
hour
in
the
which
jesus
said
unto
him
thy
son
liveth
and
himself
believed
and
his
whole
house
4
54
this
is
again
the
second
miracle
that
jesus
did
when
he
was
come
out
of
judaea
into
galilee
5
1
after
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
jews
and
jesus
went
up
to
jerusalem
5
2
now
there
is
at
jerusalem
by
the
sheep
market
a
pool
which
is
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
bethesda
having
five
porches
5
3
in
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
folk
of
blind
halt
withered
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
water
5
4
for
an
angel
went
down
at
a
certain
season
into
the
pool
and
troubled
the
water
whosoever
then
first
after
the
troubling
of
the
water
stepped
in
was
made
whole
of
whatsoever
disease
he
had
5
5
and
a
certain
man
was
there
which
had
an
infirmity
thirty
and
eight
years
5
6
when
jesus
saw
him
lie
and
knew
that
he
had
been
now
a
long
time
in
that
case
he
saith
unto
him
wilt
thou
be
made
whole
5
7
the
impotent
man
answered
him
sir
i
have
no
man
when
the
water
is
troubled
to
put
me
into
the
pool
but
while
i
am
coming
another
steppeth
down
before
me
5
8
jesus
saith
unto
him
rise
take
up
thy
bed
and
walk
5
9
and
immediately
the
man
was
made
whole
and
took
up
his
bed
and
walked
and
on
the
same
day
was
the
sabbath
5
10
the
jews
therefore
said
unto
him
that
was
cured
it
is
the
sabbath
day
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
carry
thy
bed
5
11
he
answered
them
he
that
made
me
whole
the
same
said
unto
me
take
up
thy
bed
and
walk
5
12
then
asked
they
him
what
man
is
that
which
said
unto
thee
take
up
thy
bed
and
walk
5
13
and
he
that
was
healed
wist
not
who
it
was
for
jesus
had
conveyed
himself
away
a
multitude
being
in
that
place
5
14
afterward
jesus
findeth
him
in
the
temple
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
made
whole
sin
no
more
lest
a
worse
thing
come
unto
thee
5
15
the
man
departed
and
told
the
jews
that
it
was
jesus
which
had
made
him
whole
5
16
and
therefore
did
the
jews
persecute
jesus
and
sought
to
slay
him
because
he
had
done
these
things
on
the
sabbath
day
5
17
but
jesus
answered
them
my
father
worketh
hitherto
and
i
work
5
18
therefore
the
jews
sought
the
more
to
kill
him
because
he
not
only
had
broken
the
sabbath
but
said
also
that
god
was
his
father
making
himself
equal
with
god
5
19
then
answered
jesus
and
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
but
what
he
seeth
the
father
do
for
what
things
soever
he
doeth
these
also
doeth
the
son
likewise
5
20
for
the
father
loveth
the
son
and
sheweth
him
all
things
that
himself
doeth
and
he
will
shew
him
greater
works
than
these
that
ye
may
marvel
5
21
for
as
the
father
raiseth
up
the
dead
and
quickeneth
them
even
so
the
son
quickeneth
whom
he
will
5
22
for
the
father
judgeth
no
man
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
son
5
23
that
all
men
should
honour
the
son
even
as
they
honour
the
father
he
that
honoureth
not
the
son
honoureth
not
the
father
which
hath
sent
him
5
24
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
heareth
my
word
and
believeth
on
him
that
sent
me
hath
everlasting
life
and
shall
not
come
into
condemnation
but
is
passed
from
death
unto
life
5
25
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
hour
is
coming
and
now
is
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
god
and
they
that
hear
shall
live
5
26
for
as
the
father
hath
life
in
himself
so
hath
he
given
to
the
son
to
have
life
in
himself
5
27
and
hath
given
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
also
because
he
is
the
son
of
man
5
28
marvel
not
at
this
for
the
hour
is
coming
in
the
which
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
his
voice
5
29
and
shall
come
forth
they
that
have
done
good
unto
the
resurrection
of
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
unto
the
resurrection
of
damnation
5
30
i
can
of
mine
own
self
do
nothing
as
i
hear
i
judge
and
my
judgment
is
just
because
i
seek
not
mine
own
will
but
the
will
of
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
5
31
if
i
bear
witness
of
myself
my
witness
is
not
true
5
32
there
is
another
that
beareth
witness
of
me
and
i
know
that
the
witness
which
he
witnesseth
of
me
is
true
5
33
ye
sent
unto
john
and
he
bare
witness
unto
the
truth
5
34
but
i
receive
not
testimony
from
man
but
these
things
i
say
that
ye
might
be
saved
5
35
he
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
and
ye
were
willing
for
a
season
to
rejoice
in
his
light
5
36
but
i
have
greater
witness
than
that
of
john
for
the
works
which
the
father
hath
given
me
to
finish
the
same
works
that
i
do
bear
witness
of
me
that
the
father
hath
sent
me
5
37
and
the
father
himself
which
hath
sent
me
hath
borne
witness
of
me
ye
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
time
nor
seen
his
shape
5
38
and
ye
have
not
his
word
abiding
in
you
for
whom
he
hath
sent
him
ye
believe
not
5
39
search
the
scriptures
for
in
them
ye
think
ye
have
eternal
life
and
they
are
they
which
testify
of
me
5
40
and
ye
will
not
come
to
me
that
ye
might
have
life
5
41
i
receive
not
honour
from
men
5
42
but
i
know
you
that
ye
have
not
the
love
of
god
in
you
5
43
i
am
come
in
my
father’s
name
and
ye
receive
me
not
if
another
shall
come
in
his
own
name
him
ye
will
receive
5
44
how
can
ye
believe
which
receive
honour
one
of
another
and
seek
not
the
honour
that
cometh
from
god
only
5
45
do
not
think
that
i
will
accuse
you
to
the
father
there
is
one
that
accuseth
you
even
moses
in
whom
ye
trust
5
46
for
had
ye
believed
moses
ye
would
have
believed
me
for
he
wrote
of
me
5
47
but
if
ye
believe
not
his
writings
how
shall
ye
believe
my
words
6
1
after
these
things
jesus
went
over
the
sea
of
galilee
which
is
the
sea
of
tiberias
6
2
and
a
great
multitude
followed
him
because
they
saw
his
miracles
which
he
did
on
them
that
were
diseased
6
3
and
jesus
went
up
into
a
mountain
and
there
he
sat
with
his
disciples
6
4
and
the
passover
a
feast
of
the
jews
was
nigh
6
5
when
jesus
then
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
a
great
company
come
unto
him
he
saith
unto
philip
whence
shall
we
buy
bread
that
these
may
eat
6
6
and
this
he
said
to
prove
him
for
he
himself
knew
what
he
would
do
6
7
philip
answered
him
two
hundred
pennyworth
of
bread
is
not
sufficient
for
them
that
every
one
of
them
may
take
a
little
6
8
one
of
his
disciples
andrew
simon
peter’s
brother
saith
unto
him
6
9
there
is
a
lad
here
which
hath
five
barley
loaves
and
two
small
fishes
but
what
are
they
among
so
many
6
10
and
jesus
said
make
the
men
sit
down
now
there
was
much
grass
in
the
place
so
the
men
sat
down
in
number
about
five
thousand
6
11
and
jesus
took
the
loaves
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
distributed
to
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
to
them
that
were
set
down
and
likewise
of
the
fishes
as
much
as
they
would
6
12
when
they
were
filled
he
said
unto
his
disciples
gather
up
the
fragments
that
remain
that
nothing
be
lost
6
13
therefore
they
gathered
them
together
and
filled
twelve
baskets
with
the
fragments
of
the
five
barley
loaves
which
remained
over
and
above
unto
them
that
had
eaten
6
14
then
those
men
when
they
had
seen
the
miracle
that
jesus
did
said
this
is
of
a
truth
that
prophet
that
should
come
into
the
world
6
15
when
jesus
therefore
perceived
that
they
would
come
and
take
him
by
force
to
make
him
a
king
he
departed
again
into
a
mountain
himself
alone
6
16
and
when
even
was
now
come
his
disciples
went
down
unto
the
sea
6
17
and
entered
into
a
ship
and
went
over
the
sea
toward
capernaum
and
it
was
now
dark
and
jesus
was
not
come
to
them
6
18
and
the
sea
arose
by
reason
of
a
great
wind
that
blew
6
19
so
when
they
had
rowed
about
five
and
twenty
or
thirty
furlongs
they
see
jesus
walking
on
the
sea
and
drawing
nigh
unto
the
ship
and
they
were
afraid
6
20
but
he
saith
unto
them
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
6
21
then
they
willingly
received
him
into
the
ship
and
immediately
the
ship
was
at
the
land
whither
they
went
6
22
the
day
following
when
the
people
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
none
other
boat
there
save
that
one
whereinto
his
disciples
were
entered
and
that
jesus
went
not
with
his
disciples
into
the
boat
but
that
his
disciples
were
gone
away
alone
6
23
(howbeit
there
came
other
boats
from
tiberias
nigh
unto
the
place
where
they
did
eat
bread
after
that
the
lord
had
given
thanks
)
6
24
when
the
people
therefore
saw
that
jesus
was
not
there
neither
his
disciples
they
also
took
shipping
and
came
to
capernaum
seeking
for
jesus
6
25
and
when
they
had
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
they
said
unto
him
rabbi
when
camest
thou
hither
6
26
jesus
answered
them
and
said
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
seek
me
not
because
ye
saw
the
miracles
but
because
ye
did
eat
of
the
loaves
and
were
filled
6
27
labour
not
for
the
meat
which
perisheth
but
for
that
meat
which
endureth
unto
everlasting
life
which
the
son
of
man
shall
give
unto
you
for
him
hath
god
the
father
sealed
6
28
then
said
they
unto
him
what
shall
we
do
that
we
might
work
the
works
of
god
6
29
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
this
is
the
work
of
god
that
ye
believe
on
him
whom
he
hath
sent
6
30
they
said
therefore
unto
him
what
sign
shewest
thou
then
that
we
may
see
and
believe
thee
what
dost
thou
work
6
31
our
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
desert
as
it
is
written
he
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
to
eat
6
32
then
jesus
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
moses
gave
you
not
that
bread
from
heaven
but
my
father
giveth
you
the
true
bread
from
heaven
6
33
for
the
bread
of
god
is
he
which
cometh
down
from
heaven
and
giveth
life
unto
the
world
6
34
then
said
they
unto
him
lord
evermore
give
us
this
bread
6
35
and
jesus
said
unto
them
i
am
the
bread
of
life
he
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
thirst
6
36
but
i
said
unto
you
that
ye
also
have
seen
me
and
believe
not
6
37
all
that
the
father
giveth
me
shall
come
to
me
and
him
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
6
38
for
i
came
down
from
heaven
not
to
do
mine
own
will
but
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
6
39
and
this
is
the
father’s
will
which
hath
sent
me
that
of
all
which
he
hath
given
me
i
should
lose
nothing
but
should
raise
it
up
again
at
the
last
day
6
40
and
this
is
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
that
every
one
which
seeth
the
son
and
believeth
on
him
may
have
everlasting
life
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
6
41
the
jews
then
murmured
at
him
because
he
said
i
am
the
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
6
42
and
they
said
is
not
this
jesus
the
son
of
joseph
whose
father
and
mother
we
know
how
is
it
then
that
he
saith
i
came
down
from
heaven
6
43
jesus
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
them
murmur
not
among
yourselves
6
44
no
man
can
come
to
me
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
him
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
6
45
it
is
written
in
the
prophets
and
they
shall
be
all
taught
of
god
every
man
therefore
that
hath
heard
and
hath
learned
of
the
father
cometh
unto
me
6
46
not
that
any
man
hath
seen
the
father
save
he
which
is
of
god
he
hath
seen
the
father
6
47
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
believeth
on
me
hath
everlasting
life
6
48
i
am
that
bread
of
life
6
49
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
wilderness
and
are
dead
6
50
this
is
the
bread
which
cometh
down
from
heaven
that
a
man
may
eat
thereof
and
not
die
6
51
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
for
ever
and
the
bread
that
i
will
give
is
my
flesh
which
i
will
give
for
the
life
of
the
world
6
52
the
jews
therefore
strove
among
themselves
saying
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
6
53
then
jesus
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
ye
have
no
life
in
you
6
54
whoso
eateth
my
flesh
and
drinketh
my
blood
hath
eternal
life
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
6
55
for
my
flesh
is
meat
indeed
and
my
blood
is
drink
indeed
6
56
he
that
eateth
my
flesh
and
drinketh
my
blood
dwelleth
in
me
and
i
in
him
6
57
as
the
living
father
hath
sent
me
and
i
live
by
the
father
so
he
that
eateth
me
even
he
shall
live
by
me
6
58
this
is
that
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
not
as
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
and
are
dead
he
that
eateth
of
this
bread
shall
live
for
ever
6
59
these
things
said
he
in
the
synagogue
as
he
taught
in
capernaum
6
60
many
therefore
of
his
disciples
when
they
had
heard
this
said
this
is
an
hard
saying
who
can
hear
it
6
61
when
jesus
knew
in
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
at
it
he
said
unto
them
doth
this
offend
you
6
62
what
and
if
ye
shall
see
the
son
of
man
ascend
up
where
he
was
before
6
63
it
is
the
spirit
that
quickeneth
the
flesh
profiteth
nothing
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
you
they
are
spirit
and
they
are
life
6
64
but
there
are
some
of
you
that
believe
not
for
jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
that
believed
not
and
who
should
betray
him
6
65
and
he
said
therefore
said
i
unto
you
that
no
man
can
come
unto
me
except
it
were
given
unto
him
of
my
father
6
66
from
that
time
many
of
his
disciples
went
back
and
walked
no
more
with
him
6
67
then
said
jesus
unto
the
twelve
will
ye
also
go
away
6
68
then
simon
peter
answered
him
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
life
6
69
and
we
believe
and
are
sure
that
thou
art
that
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
6
70
jesus
answered
them
have
not
i
chosen
you
twelve
and
one
of
you
is
a
devil
6
71
he
spake
of
judas
iscariot
the
son
of
simon
for
he
it
was
that
should
betray
him
being
one
of
the
twelve
7
1
after
these
things
jesus
walked
in
galilee
for
he
would
not
walk
in
jewry
because
the
jews
sought
to
kill
him
7
2
now
the
jew’s
feast
of
tabernacles
was
at
hand
7
3
his
brethren
therefore
said
unto
him
depart
hence
and
go
into
judaea
that
thy
disciples
also
may
see
the
works
that
thou
doest
7
4
for
there
is
no
man
that
doeth
any
thing
in
secret
and
he
himself
seeketh
to
be
known
openly
if
thou
do
these
things
shew
thyself
to
the
world
7
5
for
neither
did
his
brethren
believe
in
him
7
6
then
jesus
said
unto
them
my
time
is
not
yet
come
but
your
time
is
alway
ready
7
7
the
world
cannot
hate
you
but
me
it
hateth
because
i
testify
of
it
that
the
works
thereof
are
evil
7
8
go
ye
up
unto
this
feast
i
go
not
up
yet
unto
this
feast
for
my
time
is
not
yet
full
come
7
9
when
he
had
said
these
words
unto
them
he
abode
still
in
galilee
7
10
but
when
his
brethren
were
gone
up
then
went
he
also
up
unto
the
feast
not
openly
but
as
it
were
in
secret
7
11
then
the
jews
sought
him
at
the
feast
and
said
where
is
he
7
12
and
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
people
concerning
him
for
some
said
he
is
a
good
man
others
said
nay
but
he
deceiveth
the
people
7
13
howbeit
no
man
spake
openly
of
him
for
fear
of
the
jews
7
14
now
about
the
midst
of
the
feast
jesus
went
up
into
the
temple
and
taught
7
15
and
the
jews
marvelled
saying
how
knoweth
this
man
letters
having
never
learned
7
16
jesus
answered
them
and
said
my
doctrine
is
not
mine
but
his
that
sent
me
7
17
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
god
or
whether
i
speak
of
myself
7
18
he
that
speaketh
of
himself
seeketh
his
own
glory
but
he
that
seeketh
his
glory
that
sent
him
the
same
is
true
and
no
unrighteousness
is
in
him
7
19
did
not
moses
give
you
the
law
and
yet
none
of
you
keepeth
the
law
why
go
ye
about
to
kill
me
7
20
the
people
answered
and
said
thou
hast
a
devil
who
goeth
about
to
kill
thee
7
21
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
have
done
one
work
and
ye
all
marvel
7
22
moses
therefore
gave
unto
you
circumcision
(not
because
it
is
of
moses
but
of
the
fathers
)
and
ye
on
the
sabbath
day
circumcise
a
man
7
23
if
a
man
on
the
sabbath
day
receive
circumcision
that
the
law
of
moses
should
not
be
broken
are
ye
angry
at
me
because
i
have
made
a
man
every
whit
whole
on
the
sabbath
day
7
24
judge
not
according
to
the
appearance
but
judge
righteous
judgment
7
25
then
said
some
of
them
of
jerusalem
is
not
this
he
whom
they
seek
to
kill
7
26
but
lo
he
speaketh
boldly
and
they
say
nothing
unto
him
do
the
rulers
know
indeed
that
this
is
the
very
christ
7
27
howbeit
we
know
this
man
whence
he
is
but
when
christ
cometh
no
man
knoweth
whence
he
is
7
28
then
cried
jesus
in
the
temple
as
he
taught
saying
ye
both
know
me
and
ye
know
whence
i
am
and
i
am
not
come
of
myself
but
he
that
sent
me
is
true
whom
ye
know
not
7
29
but
i
know
him
for
i
am
from
him
and
he
hath
sent
me
7
30
then
they
sought
to
take
him
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
him
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
7
31
and
many
of
the
people
believed
on
him
and
said
when
christ
cometh
will
he
do
more
miracles
than
these
which
this
man
hath
done
7
32
the
pharisees
heard
that
the
people
murmured
such
things
concerning
him
and
the
pharisees
and
the
chief
priests
sent
officers
to
take
him
7
33
then
said
jesus
unto
them
yet
a
little
while
am
i
with
you
and
then
i
go
unto
him
that
sent
me
7
34
ye
shall
seek
me
and
shall
not
find
me
and
where
i
am
thither
ye
cannot
come
7
35
then
said
the
jews
among
themselves
whither
will
he
go
that
we
shall
not
find
him
will
he
go
unto
the
dispersed
among
the
gentiles
and
teach
the
gentiles
7
36
what
manner
of
saying
is
this
that
he
said
ye
shall
seek
me
and
shall
not
find
me
and
where
i
am
thither
ye
cannot
come
7
37
in
the
last
day
that
great
day
of
the
feast
jesus
stood
and
cried
saying
if
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
me
and
drink
7
38
he
that
believeth
on
me
as
the
scripture
hath
said
out
of
his
belly
shall
flow
rivers
of
living
water
7
39
(but
this
spake
he
of
the
spirit
which
they
that
believe
on
him
should
receive
for
the
holy
ghost
was
not
yet
given
because
that
jesus
was
not
yet
glorified
)
7
40
many
of
the
people
therefore
when
they
heard
this
saying
said
of
a
truth
this
is
the
prophet
7
41
others
said
this
is
the
christ
but
some
said
shall
christ
come
out
of
galilee
7
42
hath
not
the
scripture
said
that
christ
cometh
of
the
seed
of
david
and
out
of
the
town
of
bethlehem
where
david
was
7
43
so
there
was
a
division
among
the
people
because
of
him
7
44
and
some
of
them
would
have
taken
him
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
him
7
45
then
came
the
officers
to
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
and
they
said
unto
them
why
have
ye
not
brought
him
7
46
the
officers
answered
never
man
spake
like
this
man
7
47
then
answered
them
the
pharisees
are
ye
also
deceived
7
48
have
any
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
pharisees
believed
on
him
7
49
but
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
cursed
7
50
nicodemus
saith
unto
them
(he
that
came
to
jesus
by
night
being
one
of
them
)
7
51
doth
our
law
judge
any
man
before
it
hear
him
and
know
what
he
doeth
7
52
they
answered
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
also
of
galilee
search
and
look
for
out
of
galilee
ariseth
no
prophet
7
53
and
every
man
went
unto
his
own
house
8
1
jesus
went
unto
the
mount
of
olives
8
2
and
early
in
the
morning
he
came
again
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
came
unto
him
and
he
sat
down
and
taught
them
8
3
and
the
scribes
and
pharisees
brought
unto
him
a
woman
taken
in
adultery
and
when
they
had
set
her
in
the
midst
8
4
they
say
unto
him
master
this
woman
was
taken
in
adultery
in
the
very
act
8
5
now
moses
in
the
law
commanded
us
that
such
should
be
stoned
but
what
sayest
thou
8
6
this
they
said
tempting
him
that
they
might
have
to
accuse
him
but
jesus
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
ground
as
though
he
heard
them
not
8
7
so
when
they
continued
asking
him
he
lifted
up
himself
and
said
unto
them
he
that
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her
8
8
and
again
he
stooped
down
and
wrote
on
the
ground
8
9
and
they
which
heard
it
being
convicted
by
their
own
conscience
went
out
one
by
one
beginning
at
the
eldest
even
unto
the
last
and
jesus
was
left
alone
and
the
woman
standing
in
the
midst
8
10
when
jesus
had
lifted
up
himself
and
saw
none
but
the
woman
he
said
unto
her
woman
where
are
those
thine
accusers
hath
no
man
condemned
thee
8
11
she
said
no
man
lord
and
jesus
said
unto
her
neither
do
i
condemn
thee
go
and
sin
no
more
8
12
then
spake
jesus
again
unto
them
saying
i
am
the
light
of
the
world
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness
but
shall
have
the
light
of
life
8
13
the
pharisees
therefore
said
unto
him
thou
bearest
record
of
thyself
thy
record
is
not
true
8
14
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
though
i
bear
record
of
myself
yet
my
record
is
true
for
i
know
whence
i
came
and
whither
i
go
but
ye
cannot
tell
whence
i
come
and
whither
i
go
8
15
ye
judge
after
the
flesh
i
judge
no
man
8
16
and
yet
if
i
judge
my
judgment
is
true
for
i
am
not
alone
but
i
and
the
father
that
sent
me
8
17
it
is
also
written
in
your
law
that
the
testimony
of
two
men
is
true
8
18
i
am
one
that
bear
witness
of
myself
and
the
father
that
sent
me
beareth
witness
of
me
8
19
then
said
they
unto
him
where
is
thy
father
jesus
answered
ye
neither
know
me
nor
my
father
if
ye
had
known
me
ye
should
have
known
my
father
also
8
20
these
words
spake
jesus
in
the
treasury
as
he
taught
in
the
temple
and
no
man
laid
hands
on
him
for
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
8
21
then
said
jesus
again
unto
them
i
go
my
way
and
ye
shall
seek
me
and
shall
die
in
your
sins
whither
i
go
ye
cannot
come
8
22
then
said
the
jews
will
he
kill
himself
because
he
saith
whither
i
go
ye
cannot
come
8
23
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
are
from
beneath
i
am
from
above
ye
are
of
this
world
i
am
not
of
this
world
8
24
i
said
therefore
unto
you
that
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins
for
if
ye
believe
not
that
i
am
he
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins
8
25
then
said
they
unto
him
who
art
thou
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
even
the
same
that
i
said
unto
you
from
the
beginning
8
26
i
have
many
things
to
say
and
to
judge
of
you
but
he
that
sent
me
is
true
and
i
speak
to
the
world
those
things
which
i
have
heard
of
him
8
27
they
understood
not
that
he
spake
to
them
of
the
father
8
28
then
said
jesus
unto
them
when
ye
have
lifted
up
the
son
of
man
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
he
and
that
i
do
nothing
of
myself
but
as
my
father
hath
taught
me
i
speak
these
things
8
29
and
he
that
sent
me
is
with
me
the
father
hath
not
left
me
alone
for
i
do
always
those
things
that
please
him
8
30
as
he
spake
these
words
many
believed
on
him
8
31
then
said
jesus
to
those
jews
which
believed
on
him
if
ye
continue
in
my
word
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
8
32
and
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
8
33
they
answered
him
we
be
abraham’s
seed
and
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
man
how
sayest
thou
ye
shall
be
made
free
8
34
jesus
answered
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
sin
8
35
and
the
servant
abideth
not
in
the
house
for
ever
but
the
son
abideth
ever
8
36
if
the
son
therefore
shall
make
you
free
ye
shall
be
free
indeed
8
37
i
know
that
ye
are
abraham’s
seed
but
ye
seek
to
kill
me
because
my
word
hath
no
place
in
you
8
38
i
speak
that
which
i
have
seen
with
my
father
and
ye
do
that
which
ye
have
seen
with
your
father
8
39
they
answered
and
said
unto
him
abraham
is
our
father
jesus
saith
unto
them
if
ye
were
abraham’s
children
ye
would
do
the
works
of
abraham
8
40
but
now
ye
seek
to
kill
me
a
man
that
hath
told
you
the
truth
which
i
have
heard
of
god
this
did
not
abraham
8
41
ye
do
the
deeds
of
your
father
then
said
they
to
him
we
be
not
born
of
fornication
we
have
one
father
even
god
8
42
jesus
said
unto
them
if
god
were
your
father
ye
would
love
me
for
i
proceeded
forth
and
came
from
god
neither
came
i
of
myself
but
he
sent
me
8
43
why
do
ye
not
understand
my
speech
even
because
ye
cannot
hear
my
word
8
44
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
and
the
lusts
of
your
father
ye
will
do
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
abode
not
in
the
truth
because
there
is
no
truth
in
him
when
he
speaketh
a
lie
he
speaketh
of
his
own
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
8
45
and
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
ye
believe
me
not
8
46
which
of
you
convinceth
me
of
sin
and
if
i
say
the
truth
why
do
ye
not
believe
me
8
47
he
that
is
of
god
heareth
god’s
words
ye
therefore
hear
them
not
because
ye
are
not
of
god
8
48
then
answered
the
jews
and
said
unto
him
say
we
not
well
that
thou
art
a
samaritan
and
hast
a
devil
8
49
jesus
answered
i
have
not
a
devil
but
i
honour
my
father
and
ye
do
dishonour
me
8
50
and
i
seek
not
mine
own
glory
there
is
one
that
seeketh
and
judgeth
8
51
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
a
man
keep
my
saying
he
shall
never
see
death
8
52
then
said
the
jews
unto
him
now
we
know
that
thou
hast
a
devil
abraham
is
dead
and
the
prophets
and
thou
sayest
if
a
man
keep
my
saying
he
shall
never
taste
of
death
8
53
art
thou
greater
than
our
father
abraham
which
is
dead
and
the
prophets
are
dead
whom
makest
thou
thyself
8
54
jesus
answered
if
i
honour
myself
my
honour
is
nothing
it
is
my
father
that
honoureth
me
of
whom
ye
say
that
he
is
your
god
8
55
yet
ye
have
not
known
him
but
i
know
him
and
if
i
should
say
i
know
him
not
i
shall
be
a
liar
like
unto
you
but
i
know
him
and
keep
his
saying
8
56
your
father
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day
and
he
saw
it
and
was
glad
8
57
then
said
the
jews
unto
him
thou
art
not
yet
fifty
years
old
and
hast
thou
seen
abraham
8
58
jesus
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
before
abraham
was
i
am
8
59
then
took
they
up
stones
to
cast
at
him
but
jesus
hid
himself
and
went
out
of
the
temple
going
through
the
midst
of
them
and
so
passed
by
9
1
and
as
jesus
passed
by
he
saw
a
man
which
was
blind
from
his
birth
9
2
and
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
master
who
did
sin
this
man
or
his
parents
that
he
was
born
blind
9
3
jesus
answered
neither
hath
this
man
sinned
nor
his
parents
but
that
the
works
of
god
should
be
made
manifest
in
him
9
4
i
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
me
while
it
is
day
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
9
5
as
long
as
i
am
in
the
world
i
am
the
light
of
the
world
9
6
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
spat
on
the
ground
and
made
clay
of
the
spittle
and
he
anointed
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
with
the
clay
9
7
and
said
unto
him
go
wash
in
the
pool
of
siloam
(which
is
by
interpretation
sent
)
he
went
his
way
therefore
and
washed
and
came
seeing
9
8
the
neighbours
therefore
and
they
which
before
had
seen
him
that
he
was
blind
said
is
not
this
he
that
sat
and
begged
9
9
some
said
this
is
he
others
said
he
is
like
him
but
he
said
i
am
he
9
10
therefore
said
they
unto
him
how
were
thine
eyes
opened
9
11
he
answered
and
said
a
man
that
is
called
jesus
made
clay
and
anointed
mine
eyes
and
said
unto
me
go
to
the
pool
of
siloam
and
wash
and
i
went
and
washed
and
i
received
sight
9
12
then
said
they
unto
him
where
is
he
he
said
i
know
not
9
13
they
brought
to
the
pharisees
him
that
aforetime
was
blind
9
14
and
it
was
the
sabbath
day
when
jesus
made
the
clay
and
opened
his
eyes
9
15
then
again
the
pharisees
also
asked
him
how
he
had
received
his
sight
he
said
unto
them
he
put
clay
upon
mine
eyes
and
i
washed
and
do
see
9
16
therefore
said
some
of
the
pharisees
this
man
is
not
of
god
because
he
keepeth
not
the
sabbath
day
others
said
how
can
a
man
that
is
a
sinner
do
such
miracles
and
there
was
a
division
among
them
9
17
they
say
unto
the
blind
man
again
what
sayest
thou
of
him
that
he
hath
opened
thine
eyes
he
said
he
is
a
prophet
9
18
but
the
jews
did
not
believe
concerning
him
that
he
had
been
blind
and
received
his
sight
until
they
called
the
parents
of
him
that
had
received
his
sight
9
19
and
they
asked
them
saying
is
this
your
son
who
ye
say
was
born
blind
how
then
doth
he
now
see
9
20
his
parents
answered
them
and
said
we
know
that
this
is
our
son
and
that
he
was
born
blind
9
21
but
by
what
means
he
now
seeth
we
know
not
or
who
hath
opened
his
eyes
we
know
not
he
is
of
age
ask
him
he
shall
speak
for
himself
9
22
these
words
spake
his
parents
because
they
feared
the
jews
for
the
jews
had
agreed
already
that
if
any
man
did
confess
that
he
was
christ
he
should
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue
9
23
therefore
said
his
parents
he
is
of
age
ask
him
9
24
then
again
called
they
the
man
that
was
blind
and
said
unto
him
give
god
the
praise
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
sinner
9
25
he
answered
and
said
whether
he
be
a
sinner
or
no
i
know
not
one
thing
i
know
that
whereas
i
was
blind
now
i
see
9
26
then
said
they
to
him
again
what
did
he
to
thee
how
opened
he
thine
eyes
9
27
he
answered
them
i
have
told
you
already
and
ye
did
not
hear
wherefore
would
ye
hear
it
again
will
ye
also
be
his
disciples
9
28
then
they
reviled
him
and
said
thou
art
his
disciple
but
we
are
moses’
disciples
9
29
we
know
that
god
spake
unto
moses
as
for
this
fellow
we
know
not
from
whence
he
is
9
30
the
man
answered
and
said
unto
them
why
herein
is
a
marvellous
thing
that
ye
know
not
from
whence
he
is
and
yet
he
hath
opened
mine
eyes
9
31
now
we
know
that
god
heareth
not
sinners
but
if
any
man
be
a
worshipper
of
god
and
doeth
his
will
him
he
heareth
9
32
since
the
world
began
was
it
not
heard
that
any
man
opened
the
eyes
of
one
that
was
born
blind
9
33
if
this
man
were
not
of
god
he
could
do
nothing
9
34
they
answered
and
said
unto
him
thou
wast
altogether
born
in
sins
and
dost
thou
teach
us
and
they
cast
him
out
9
35
jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
out
and
when
he
had
found
him
he
said
unto
him
dost
thou
believe
on
the
son
of
god
9
36
he
answered
and
said
who
is
he
lord
that
i
might
believe
on
him
9
37
and
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
hast
both
seen
him
and
it
is
he
that
talketh
with
thee
9
38
and
he
said
lord
i
believe
and
he
worshipped
him
9
39
and
jesus
said
for
judgment
i
am
come
into
this
world
that
they
which
see
not
might
see
and
that
they
which
see
might
be
made
blind
9
40
and
some
of
the
pharisees
which
were
with
him
heard
these
words
and
said
unto
him
are
we
blind
also
9
41
jesus
said
unto
them
if
ye
were
blind
ye
should
have
no
sin
but
now
ye
say
we
see
therefore
your
sin
remaineth
10
1
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
entereth
not
by
the
door
into
the
sheepfold
but
climbeth
up
some
other
way
the
same
is
a
thief
and
a
robber
10
2
but
he
that
entereth
in
by
the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
sheep
10
3
to
him
the
porter
openeth
and
the
sheep
hear
his
voice
and
he
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
name
and
leadeth
them
out
10
4
and
when
he
putteth
forth
his
own
sheep
he
goeth
before
them
and
the
sheep
follow
him
for
they
know
his
voice
10
5
and
a
stranger
will
they
not
follow
but
will
flee
from
him
for
they
know
not
the
voice
of
strangers
10
6
this
parable
spake
jesus
unto
them
but
they
understood
not
what
things
they
were
which
he
spake
unto
them
10
7
then
said
jesus
unto
them
again
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
am
the
door
of
the
sheep
10
8
all
that
ever
came
before
me
are
thieves
and
robbers
but
the
sheep
did
not
hear
them
10
9
i
am
the
door
by
me
if
any
man
enter
in
he
shall
be
saved
and
shall
go
in
and
out
and
find
pasture
10
10
the
thief
cometh
not
but
for
to
steal
and
to
kill
and
to
destroy
i
am
come
that
they
might
have
life
and
that
they
might
have
it
more
abundantly
10
11
i
am
the
good
shepherd
the
good
shepherd
giveth
his
life
for
the
sheep
10
12
but
he
that
is
an
hireling
and
not
the
shepherd
whose
own
the
sheep
are
not
seeth
the
wolf
coming
and
leaveth
the
sheep
and
fleeth
and
the
wolf
catcheth
them
and
scattereth
the
sheep
10
13
the
hireling
fleeth
because
he
is
an
hireling
and
careth
not
for
the
sheep
10
14
i
am
the
good
shepherd
and
know
my
sheep
and
am
known
of
mine
10
15
as
the
father
knoweth
me
even
so
know
i
the
father
and
i
lay
down
my
life
for
the
sheep
10
16
and
other
sheep
i
have
which
are
not
of
this
fold
them
also
i
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
10
17
therefore
doth
my
father
love
me
because
i
lay
down
my
life
that
i
might
take
it
again
10
18
no
man
taketh
it
from
me
but
i
lay
it
down
of
myself
i
have
power
to
lay
it
down
and
i
have
power
to
take
it
again
this
commandment
have
i
received
of
my
father
10
19
there
was
a
division
therefore
again
among
the
jews
for
these
sayings
10
20
and
many
of
them
said
he
hath
a
devil
and
is
mad
why
hear
ye
him
10
21
others
said
these
are
not
the
words
of
him
that
hath
a
devil
can
a
devil
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
10
22
and
it
was
at
jerusalem
the
feast
of
the
dedication
and
it
was
winter
10
23
and
jesus
walked
in
the
temple
in
solomon’s
porch
10
24
then
came
the
jews
round
about
him
and
said
unto
him
how
long
dost
thou
make
us
to
doubt
if
thou
be
the
christ
tell
us
plainly
10
25
jesus
answered
them
i
told
you
and
ye
believed
not
the
works
that
i
do
in
my
father’s
name
they
bear
witness
of
me
10
26
but
ye
believe
not
because
ye
are
not
of
my
sheep
as
i
said
unto
you
10
27
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
10
28
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
10
29
my
father
which
gave
them
me
is
greater
than
all
and
no
man
is
able
to
pluck
them
out
of
my
father’s
hand
10
30
i
and
my
father
are
one
10
31
then
the
jews
took
up
stones
again
to
stone
him
10
32
jesus
answered
them
many
good
works
have
i
shewed
you
from
my
father
for
which
of
those
works
do
ye
stone
me
10
33
the
jews
answered
him
saying
for
a
good
work
we
stone
thee
not
but
for
blasphemy
and
because
that
thou
being
a
man
makest
thyself
god
10
34
jesus
answered
them
is
it
not
written
in
your
law
i
said
ye
are
gods
10
35
if
he
called
them
gods
unto
whom
the
word
of
god
came
and
the
scripture
cannot
be
broken
10
36
say
ye
of
him
whom
the
father
hath
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
thou
blasphemest
because
i
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
10
37
if
i
do
not
the
works
of
my
father
believe
me
not
10
38
but
if
i
do
though
ye
believe
not
me
believe
the
works
that
ye
may
know
and
believe
that
the
father
is
in
me
and
i
in
him
10
39
therefore
they
sought
again
to
take
him
but
he
escaped
out
of
their
hand
10
40
and
went
away
again
beyond
jordan
into
the
place
where
john
at
first
baptized
and
there
he
abode
10
41
and
many
resorted
unto
him
and
said
john
did
no
miracle
but
all
things
that
john
spake
of
this
man
were
true
10
42
and
many
believed
on
him
there
11
1
now
a
certain
man
was
sick
named
lazarus
of
bethany
the
town
of
mary
and
her
sister
martha
11
2
(it
was
that
mary
which
anointed
the
lord
with
ointment
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
whose
brother
lazarus
was
sick
)
11
3
therefore
his
sisters
sent
unto
him
saying
lord
behold
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
sick
11
4
when
jesus
heard
that
he
said
this
sickness
is
not
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
of
god
that
the
son
of
god
might
be
glorified
thereby
11
5
now
jesus
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
lazarus
11
6
when
he
had
heard
therefore
that
he
was
sick
he
abode
two
days
still
in
the
same
place
where
he
was
11
7
then
after
that
saith
he
to
his
disciples
let
us
go
into
judaea
again
11
8
his
disciples
say
unto
him
master
the
jews
of
late
sought
to
stone
thee
and
goest
thou
thither
again
11
9
jesus
answered
are
there
not
twelve
hours
in
the
day
if
any
man
walk
in
the
day
he
stumbleth
not
because
he
seeth
the
light
of
this
world
11
10
but
if
a
man
walk
in
the
night
he
stumbleth
because
there
is
no
light
in
him
11
11
these
things
said
he
and
after
that
he
saith
unto
them
our
friend
lazarus
sleepeth
but
i
go
that
i
may
awake
him
out
of
sleep
11
12
then
said
his
disciples
lord
if
he
sleep
he
shall
do
well
11
13
howbeit
jesus
spake
of
his
death
but
they
thought
that
he
had
spoken
of
taking
of
rest
in
sleep
11
14
then
said
jesus
unto
them
plainly
lazarus
is
dead
11
15
and
i
am
glad
for
your
sakes
that
i
was
not
there
to
the
intent
ye
may
believe
nevertheless
let
us
go
unto
him
11
16
then
said
thomas
which
is
called
didymus
unto
his
fellow
disciples
let
us
also
go
that
we
may
die
with
him
11
17
then
when
jesus
came
he
found
that
he
had
lain
in
the
grave
four
days
already
11
18
now
bethany
was
nigh
unto
jerusalem
about
fifteen
furlongs
off
11
19
and
many
of
the
jews
came
to
martha
and
mary
to
comfort
them
concerning
their
brother
11
20
then
martha
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
jesus
was
coming
went
and
met
him
but
mary
sat
still
in
the
house
11
21
then
said
martha
unto
jesus
lord
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
11
22
but
i
know
that
even
now
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
of
god
god
will
give
it
thee
11
23
jesus
saith
unto
her
thy
brother
shall
rise
again
11
24
martha
saith
unto
him
i
know
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day
11
25
jesus
said
unto
her
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
11
26
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
believest
thou
this
11
27
she
saith
unto
him
yea
lord
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
god
which
should
come
into
the
world
11
28
and
when
she
had
so
said
she
went
her
way
and
called
mary
her
sister
secretly
saying
the
master
is
come
and
calleth
for
thee
11
29
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
she
arose
quickly
and
came
unto
him
11
30
now
jesus
was
not
yet
come
into
the
town
but
was
in
that
place
where
martha
met
him
11
31
the
jews
then
which
were
with
her
in
the
house
and
comforted
her
when
they
saw
mary
that
she
rose
up
hastily
and
went
out
followed
her
saying
she
goeth
unto
the
grave
to
weep
there
11
32
then
when
mary
was
come
where
jesus
was
and
saw
him
she
fell
down
at
his
feet
saying
unto
him
lord
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
11
33
when
jesus
therefore
saw
her
weeping
and
the
jews
also
weeping
which
came
with
her
he
groaned
in
the
spirit
and
was
troubled
11
34
and
said
where
have
ye
laid
him
they
said
unto
him
lord
come
and
see
11
35
jesus
wept
11
36
then
said
the
jews
behold
how
he
loved
him
11
37
and
some
of
them
said
could
not
this
man
which
opened
the
eyes
of
the
blind
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
died
11
38
jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
cometh
to
the
grave
it
was
a
cave
and
a
stone
lay
upon
it
11
39
jesus
said
take
ye
away
the
stone
martha
the
sister
of
him
that
was
dead
saith
unto
him
lord
by
this
time
he
stinketh
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days
11
40
jesus
saith
unto
her
said
i
not
unto
thee
that
if
thou
wouldest
believe
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
god
11
41
then
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
was
laid
and
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
11
42
and
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
i
said
it
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
11
43
and
when
he
thus
had
spoken
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
forth
11
44
and
he
that
was
dead
came
forth
bound
hand
and
foot
with
graveclothes
and
his
face
was
bound
about
with
a
napkin
jesus
saith
unto
them
loose
him
and
let
him
go
11
45
then
many
of
the
jews
which
came
to
mary
and
had
seen
the
things
which
jesus
did
believed
on
him
11
46
but
some
of
them
went
their
ways
to
the
pharisees
and
told
them
what
things
jesus
had
done
11
47
then
gathered
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
a
council
and
said
what
do
we
for
this
man
doeth
many
miracles
11
48
if
we
let
him
thus
alone
all
men
will
believe
on
him
and
the
romans
shall
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
nation
11
49
and
one
of
them
named
caiaphas
being
the
high
priest
that
same
year
said
unto
them
ye
know
nothing
at
all
11
50
nor
consider
that
it
is
expedient
for
us
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
and
that
the
whole
nation
perish
not
11
51
and
this
spake
he
not
of
himself
but
being
high
priest
that
year
he
prophesied
that
jesus
should
die
for
that
nation
11
52
and
not
for
that
nation
only
but
that
also
he
should
gather
together
in
one
the
children
of
god
that
were
scattered
abroad
11
53
then
from
that
day
forth
they
took
counsel
together
for
to
put
him
to
death
11
54
jesus
therefore
walked
no
more
openly
among
the
jews
but
went
thence
unto
a
country
near
to
the
wilderness
into
a
city
called
ephraim
and
there
continued
with
his
disciples
11
55
and
the
jews’
passover
was
nigh
at
hand
and
many
went
out
of
the
country
up
to
jerusalem
before
the
passover
to
purify
themselves
11
56
then
sought
they
for
jesus
and
spake
among
themselves
as
they
stood
in
the
temple
what
think
ye
that
he
will
not
come
to
the
feast
11
57
now
both
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
had
given
a
commandment
that
if
any
man
knew
where
he
were
he
should
shew
it
that
they
might
take
him
12
1
then
jesus
six
days
before
the
passover
came
to
bethany
where
lazarus
was
which
had
been
dead
whom
he
raised
from
the
dead
12
2
there
they
made
him
a
supper
and
martha
served
but
lazarus
was
one
of
them
that
sat
at
the
table
with
him
12
3
then
took
mary
a
pound
of
ointment
of
spikenard
very
costly
and
anointed
the
feet
of
jesus
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
the
ointment
12
4
then
saith
one
of
his
disciples
judas
iscariot
simon’s
son
which
should
betray
him
12
5
why
was
not
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
pence
and
given
to
the
poor
12
6
this
he
said
not
that
he
cared
for
the
poor
but
because
he
was
a
thief
and
had
the
bag
and
bare
what
was
put
therein
12
7
then
said
jesus
let
her
alone
against
the
day
of
my
burying
hath
she
kept
this
12
8
for
the
poor
always
ye
have
with
you
but
me
ye
have
not
always
12
9
much
people
of
the
jews
therefore
knew
that
he
was
there
and
they
came
not
for
jesus’
sake
only
but
that
they
might
see
lazarus
also
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
dead
12
10
but
the
chief
priests
consulted
that
they
might
put
lazarus
also
to
death
12
11
because
that
by
reason
of
him
many
of
the
jews
went
away
and
believed
on
jesus
12
12
on
the
next
day
much
people
that
were
come
to
the
feast
when
they
heard
that
jesus
was
coming
to
jerusalem
12
13
took
branches
of
palm
trees
and
went
forth
to
meet
him
and
cried
hosanna
blessed
is
the
king
of
israel
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
12
14
and
jesus
when
he
had
found
a
young
ass
sat
thereon
as
it
is
written
12
15
fear
not
daughter
of
sion
behold
thy
king
cometh
sitting
on
an
ass’s
colt
12
16
these
things
understood
not
his
disciples
at
the
first
but
when
jesus
was
glorified
then
remembered
they
that
these
things
were
written
of
him
and
that
they
had
done
these
things
unto
him
12
17
the
people
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
lazarus
out
of
his
grave
and
raised
him
from
the
dead
bare
record
12
18
for
this
cause
the
people
also
met
him
for
that
they
heard
that
he
had
done
this
miracle
12
19
the
pharisees
therefore
said
among
themselves
perceive
ye
how
ye
prevail
nothing
behold
the
world
is
gone
after
him
12
20
and
there
were
certain
greeks
among
them
that
came
up
to
worship
at
the
feast
12
21
the
same
came
therefore
to
philip
which
was
of
bethsaida
of
galilee
and
desired
him
saying
sir
we
would
see
jesus
12
22
philip
cometh
and
telleth
andrew
and
again
andrew
and
philip
tell
jesus
12
23
and
jesus
answered
them
saying
the
hour
is
come
that
the
son
of
man
should
be
glorified
12
24
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die
it
abideth
alone
but
if
it
die
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
12
25
he
that
loveth
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
he
that
hateth
his
life
in
this
world
shall
keep
it
unto
life
eternal
12
26
if
any
man
serve
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
if
any
man
serve
me
him
will
my
father
honour
12
27
now
is
my
soul
troubled
and
what
shall
i
say
father
save
me
from
this
hour
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
hour
12
28
father
glorify
thy
name
then
came
there
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
i
have
both
glorified
it
and
will
glorify
it
again
12
29
the
people
therefore
that
stood
by
and
heard
it
said
that
it
thundered
others
said
an
angel
spake
to
him
12
30
jesus
answered
and
said
this
voice
came
not
because
of
me
but
for
your
sakes
12
31
now
is
the
judgment
of
this
world
now
shall
the
prince
of
this
world
be
cast
out
12
32
and
i
if
i
be
lifted
up
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
men
unto
me
12
33
this
he
said
signifying
what
death
he
should
die
12
34
the
people
answered
him
we
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
christ
abideth
for
ever
and
how
sayest
thou
the
son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up
who
is
this
son
of
man
12
35
then
jesus
said
unto
them
yet
a
little
while
is
the
light
with
you
walk
while
ye
have
the
light
lest
darkness
come
upon
you
for
he
that
walketh
in
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth
12
36
while
ye
have
light
believe
in
the
light
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
light
these
things
spake
jesus
and
departed
and
did
hide
himself
from
them
12
37
but
though
he
had
done
so
many
miracles
before
them
yet
they
believed
not
on
him
12
38
that
the
saying
of
esaias
the
prophet
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spake
lord
who
hath
believed
our
report
and
to
whom
hath
the
arm
of
the
lord
been
revealed
12
39
therefore
they
could
not
believe
because
that
esaias
said
again
12
40
he
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
hardened
their
heart
that
they
should
not
see
with
their
eyes
nor
understand
with
their
heart
and
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
12
41
these
things
said
esaias
when
he
saw
his
glory
and
spake
of
him
12
42
nevertheless
among
the
chief
rulers
also
many
believed
on
him
but
because
of
the
pharisees
they
did
not
confess
him
lest
they
should
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue
12
43
for
they
loved
the
praise
of
men
more
than
the
praise
of
god
12
44
jesus
cried
and
said
he
that
believeth
on
me
believeth
not
on
me
but
on
him
that
sent
me
12
45
and
he
that
seeth
me
seeth
him
that
sent
me
12
46
i
am
come
a
light
into
the
world
that
whosoever
believeth
on
me
should
not
abide
in
darkness
12
47
and
if
any
man
hear
my
words
and
believe
not
i
judge
him
not
for
i
came
not
to
judge
the
world
but
to
save
the
world
12
48
he
that
rejecteth
me
and
receiveth
not
my
words
hath
one
that
judgeth
him
the
word
that
i
have
spoken
the
same
shall
judge
him
in
the
last
day
12
49
for
i
have
not
spoken
of
myself
but
the
father
which
sent
me
he
gave
me
a
commandment
what
i
should
say
and
what
i
should
speak
12
50
and
i
know
that
his
commandment
is
life
everlasting
whatsoever
i
speak
therefore
even
as
the
father
said
unto
me
so
i
speak
13
1
now
before
the
feast
of
the
passover
when
jesus
knew
that
his
hour
was
come
that
he
should
depart
out
of
this
world
unto
the
father
having
loved
his
own
which
were
in
the
world
he
loved
them
unto
the
end
13
2
and
supper
being
ended
the
devil
having
now
put
into
the
heart
of
judas
iscariot
simon’s
son
to
betray
him
13
3
jesus
knowing
that
the
father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands
and
that
he
was
come
from
god
and
went
to
god
13
4
he
riseth
from
supper
and
laid
aside
his
garments
and
took
a
towel
and
girded
himself
13
5
after
that
he
poureth
water
into
a
bason
and
began
to
wash
the
disciples’
feet
and
to
wipe
them
with
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
girded
13
6
then
cometh
he
to
simon
peter
and
peter
saith
unto
him
lord
dost
thou
wash
my
feet
13
7
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
what
i
do
thou
knowest
not
now
but
thou
shalt
know
hereafter
13
8
peter
saith
unto
him
thou
shalt
never
wash
my
feet
jesus
answered
him
if
i
wash
thee
not
thou
hast
no
part
with
me
13
9
simon
peter
saith
unto
him
lord
not
my
feet
only
but
also
my
hands
and
my
head
13
10
jesus
saith
to
him
he
that
is
washed
needeth
not
save
to
wash
his
feet
but
is
clean
every
whit
and
ye
are
clean
but
not
all
13
11
for
he
knew
who
should
betray
him
therefore
said
he
ye
are
not
all
clean
13
12
so
after
he
had
washed
their
feet
and
had
taken
his
garments
and
was
set
down
again
he
said
unto
them
know
ye
what
i
have
done
to
you
13
13
ye
call
me
master
and
lord
and
ye
say
well
for
so
i
am
13
14
if
i
then
your
lord
and
master
have
washed
your
feet
ye
also
ought
to
wash
one
another’s
feet
13
15
for
i
have
given
you
an
example
that
ye
should
do
as
i
have
done
to
you
13
16
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
neither
he
that
is
sent
greater
than
he
that
sent
him
13
17
if
ye
know
these
things
happy
are
ye
if
ye
do
them
13
18
i
speak
not
of
you
all
i
know
whom
i
have
chosen
but
that
the
scripture
may
be
fulfilled
he
that
eateth
bread
with
me
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
13
19
now
i
tell
you
before
it
come
that
when
it
is
come
to
pass
ye
may
believe
that
i
am
he
13
20
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
receiveth
whomsoever
i
send
receiveth
me
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me
13
21
when
jesus
had
thus
said
he
was
troubled
in
spirit
and
testified
and
said
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
me
13
22
then
the
disciples
looked
one
on
another
doubting
of
whom
he
spake
13
23
now
there
was
leaning
on
jesus’
bosom
one
of
his
disciples
whom
jesus
loved
13
24
simon
peter
therefore
beckoned
to
him
that
he
should
ask
who
it
should
be
of
whom
he
spake
13
25
he
then
lying
on
jesus’
breast
saith
unto
him
lord
who
is
it
13
26
jesus
answered
he
it
is
to
whom
i
shall
give
a
sop
when
i
have
dipped
it
and
when
he
had
dipped
the
sop
he
gave
it
to
judas
iscariot
the
son
of
simon
13
27
and
after
the
sop
satan
entered
into
him
then
said
jesus
unto
him
that
thou
doest
do
quickly
13
28
now
no
man
at
the
table
knew
for
what
intent
he
spake
this
unto
him
13
29
for
some
of
them
thought
because
judas
had
the
bag
that
jesus
had
said
unto
him
buy
those
things
that
we
have
need
of
against
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
13
30
he
then
having
received
the
sop
went
immediately
out
and
it
was
night
13
31
therefore
when
he
was
gone
out
jesus
said
now
is

that
ye
are
my
disciples
if
ye
have
love
one
to
another

him
whither
i
go
thou
canst
not
follow

37
peter

unto
him
lord

i
follow
thee
now
i
will
lay
down
my
life
for
thy
sake
13
38

down
thy
life
for
my
sake

and
prepare
a
place
for
you

way

thomas
saith
unto
him
lord
we

not
whither
thou

the
way
14

jesus
saith
unto
him
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
man
cometh
unto
the
father
but
by
me
14
7
if
ye
had
known
me
ye
should
have
known
my
father
also
and
from
henceforth
ye
know
him
and
have
seen
him
14

philip
saith
unto
him
lord

us
the
father
and
it
sufficeth
us
14

jesus
saith
unto
him
have
i
been
so
long
time
with
you
and
yet
hast
thou
not
known
me
philip
he
that
hath
seen
me
hath
seen
the
father
and
how
sayest
thou
then
shew
us
the
father
14
10
believest
thou
not
that
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
you
i
speak
not
of
myself
but
the
father
that
dwelleth
in
me
he
doeth
the
works
14
11
believe
me
that
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
or
else
believe
me
for
the
very
works’
sake
14
12
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
and
greater
works
than
these
shall
he
do
because
i
go
unto
my
father
14
13
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name
that
will
i
do
that
the
father
may
be
glorified
in
the
son
14
14
if
ye
shall
ask
any
thing
in
my
name
i
will
do
it
14
15
if
ye
love
me
keep
my
commandments
14
16
and
i
will
pray
the
father
and
he
shall
give
you
another
comforter
that
he
may
abide
with
you
for
ever
14
17
even
the
spirit
of
truth
whom
the
world
cannot
receive
because
it
seeth
him
not
neither
knoweth
him
but
ye
know
him
for
he
dwelleth
with
you
and
shall
be
in
you
14
18
i
will
not
leave
you
comfortless
i
will
come
to
you
14
19
yet
a
little
while
and
the
world
seeth
me
no
more
but
ye
see
me
because
i
live
ye
shall
live
also
14
20
at
that
day
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
in
my
father
and
ye
in
me
and
i
in
you
14
21
he
that
hath
my
commandments
and
keepeth
them
he
it
is
that
loveth
me
and
he
that
loveth
me
shall
be
loved
of
my
father
and
i
will
love
him
and
will
manifest
myself
to
him
14
22
judas
saith
unto
him
not
iscariot
lord
how
is
it
that
thou
wilt
manifest
thyself
unto
us
and
not
unto
the
world
14
23
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
if
a
man
love
me
he
will
keep
my
words
and
my
father
will
love
him
and
we
will
come
unto
him
and
make
our
abode
with
him
14
24
he
that
loveth
me
not
keepeth
not
my
sayings
and
the
word
which
ye
hear
is
not
mine
but
the
father’s
which
sent
me
14
25
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
you
being
yet
present
with
you
14
26
but
the
comforter
which
is
the
holy
ghost
whom
the
father
will
send
in
my
name
he
shall
teach
you
all
things
and
bring
all
things
to
your
remembrance
whatsoever
i
have
said
unto
you
14
27
peace
i
leave
with
you
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
not
as
the
world
giveth
give
i
unto
you
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
neither
let
it
be
afraid
14
28
ye
have
heard
how
i
said
unto
you
i
go
away
and
come
again
unto
you
if
ye
loved
me
ye
would
rejoice
because
i
said
i
go
unto
the
father
for
my
father
is
greater
than
i
14
29
and
now
i
have
told
you
before
it
come
to
pass
that
when
it
is
come
to
pass
ye
might
believe
14
30
hereafter
i
will
not
talk
much
with
you
for
the
prince
of
this
world
cometh
and
hath
nothing
in
me
14
31
but
that
the
world
may
know
that
i
love
the
father
and
as
the
father
gave
me
commandment
even
so
i
do
arise
let
us
go
hence
15
1
i
am
the
true
vine
and
my
father
is
the
husbandman
15
2
every
branch
in
me
that
beareth
not
fruit
he
taketh
away
and
every
branch
that
beareth
fruit
he
purgeth
it
that
it
may
bring
forth
more
fruit
15
3
now
ye
are
clean
through
the
word
which
i
have
spoken
unto
you
15
4
abide
in
me
and
i
in
you
as
the
branch
cannot
bear
fruit
of
itself
except
it
abide
in
the
vine
no
more
can
ye
except
ye
abide
in
me
15
5
i
am
the
vine
ye
are
the
branches
he
that
abideth
in
me
and
i
in
him
the
same
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
for
without
me
ye
can
do
nothing
15
6
if
a
man
abide
not
in
me
he
is
cast
forth
as
a
branch
and
is
withered
and
men
gather
them
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
and
they
are
burned
15
7
if
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
words
abide
in
you
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
will
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
15
8
herein
is
my
father
glorified
that
ye
bear
much
fruit
so
shall
ye
be
my
disciples
15
9
as
the
father
hath
loved
me
so
have
i
loved
you
continue
ye
in
my
love
15
10
if
ye
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
abide
in
my
love
even
as
i
have
kept
my
father’s
commandments
and
abide
in
his
love
15
11
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
you
that
my
joy
might
remain
in
you
and
that
your
joy
might
be
full
15
12
this
is
my
commandment
that
ye
love
one
another
as
i
have
loved
you
15
13
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
15
14
ye
are
my
friends
if
ye
do
whatsoever
i
command
you
15
15
henceforth
i
call
you
not
servants
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth
but
i
have
called
you
friends
for
all
things
that
i
have
heard
of
my
father
i
have
made
known
unto
you
15
16
ye
have
not
chosen
me
but
i
have
chosen
you
and
ordained
you
that
ye
should
go
and
bring
forth
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
remain
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
may
give
it
you
15
17
these
things
i
command
you
that
ye
love
one
another
15
18
if
the
world
hate
you
ye
know
that
it
hated
me
before
it
hated
you
15
19
if
ye
were
of
the
world
the
world
would
love
his
own
but
because
ye
are
not
of
the
world
but
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world
therefore
the
world
hateth
you
15
20
remember
the
word
that
i
said
unto
you
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
if
they
have
persecuted
me
they
will
also
persecute
you
if
they
have
kept
my
saying
they
will
keep
yours
also
15
21
but
all
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
for
my
name’s
sake
because
they
know
not
him
that
sent
me
15
22
if
i
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
them
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
they
have
no
cloak
for
their
sin
15
23
he
that
hateth
me
hateth
my
father
also
15
24
if
i
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
which
none
other
man
did
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
hated
both
me
and
my
father
15
25
but
this
cometh
to
pass
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
that
is
written
in
their
law
they
hated
me
without
a
cause
15
26
but
when
the
comforter
is
come
whom
i
will
send
unto
you
from
the
father
even
the
spirit
of
truth
which
proceedeth
from
the
father
he
shall
testify
of
me
15
27
and
ye
also
shall
bear
witness
because
ye
have
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
16
1
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
you
that
ye
should
not
be
offended
16
2
they
shall
put
you
out
of
the
synagogues
yea
the
time
cometh
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
god
service
16
3
and
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
because
they
have
not
known
the
father
nor
me
16
4
but
these
things
have
i
told
you
that
when
the
time
shall
come
ye
may
remember
that
i
told
you
of
them
and
these
things
i
said
not
unto
you
at
the
beginning
because
i
was
with
you
16
5
but
now
i
go
my
way
to
him
that
sent
me
and
none
of
you
asketh
me
whither
goest
thou
16
6
but
because
i
have
said
these
things
unto
you
sorrow
hath
filled
your
heart
16
7
nevertheless
i
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
away
for
if
i
go
not
away
the
comforter
will
not
come
unto
you
but
if
i
depart
i
will
send
him
unto
you
16
8
and
when
he
is
come
he
will
reprove
the
world
of
sin
and
of
righteousness
and
of
judgment
16
9
of
sin
because
they
believe
not
on
me
16
10
of
righteousness
because
i
go
to
my
father
and
ye
see
me
no
more
16
11
of
judgment
because
the
prince
of
this
world
is
judged
16
12
i
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
you
but
ye
cannot
bear
them
now
16
13
howbeit
when
he
the
spirit
of
truth
is
come
he
will
guide
you
into
all
truth
for
he
shall
not
speak
of
himself
but
whatsoever
he
shall
hear
that
shall
he
speak
and
he
will
shew
you
things
to
come
16
14
he
shall
glorify
me
for
he
shall
receive
of
mine
and
shall
shew
it
unto
you
16
15
all
things
that
the
father
hath
are
mine
therefore
said
i
that
he
shall
take
of
mine
and
shall
shew
it
unto
you
16
16
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
not
see
me
and
again
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
see
me
because
i
go
to
the
father
16
17
then
said
some
of
his
disciples
among
themselves
what
is
this
that
he
saith
unto
us
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
not
see
me
and
again
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
see
me
and
because
i
go
to
the
father
16
18
they
said
therefore
what
is
this
that
he
saith
a
little
while
we
cannot
tell
what
he
saith
16
19
now
jesus
knew
that
they
were
desirous
to
ask
him
and
said
unto
them
do
ye
enquire
among
yourselves
of
that
i
said
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
not
see
me
and
again
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
see
me
16
20
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
shall
weep
and
lament
but
the
world
shall
rejoice
and
ye
shall
be
sorrowful
but
your
sorrow
shall
be
turned
into
joy
16
21
a
woman
when
she
is
in
travail
hath
sorrow
because
her
hour
is
come
but
as
soon
as
she
is
delivered
of
the
child
she
remembereth
no
more
the
anguish
for
joy
that
a
man
is
born
into
the
world
16
22
and
ye
now
therefore
have
sorrow
but
i
will
see
you
again
and
your
heart
shall
rejoice
and
your
joy
no
man
taketh
from
you
16
23
and
in
that
day
ye
shall
ask
me
nothing
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
he
will
give
it
you
16
24
hitherto
have
ye
asked
nothing
in
my
name
ask
and
ye
shall
receive
that
your
joy
may
be
full
16
25
these
things
have
i
spoken
unto
you
in
proverbs
but
the
time
cometh
when
i
shall
no
more
speak
unto
you
in
proverbs
but
i
shall
shew
you
plainly
of
the
father
16
26
at
that
day
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name
and
i
say
not
unto
you
that
i
will
pray
the
father
for
you
16
27
for
the
father
himself
loveth
you
because
ye
have
loved
me
and
have
believed
that
i
came
out
from
god
16
28
i
came
forth
from
the
father
and
am
come
into
the
world
again
i
leave
the
world
and
go
to
the
father
16
29
his
disciples
said
unto
him
lo
now
speakest
thou
plainly
and
speakest
no
proverb
16
30
now
are
we
sure
that
thou
knowest
all
things
and
needest
not
that
any
man
should
ask
thee
by
this
we
believe
that
thou
camest
forth
from
god
16
31
jesus
answered
them
do
ye
now
believe
16
32
behold
the
hour
cometh
yea
is
now
come
that
ye
shall
be
scattered
every
man
to
his
own
and
shall
leave
me
alone
and
yet
i
am
not
alone
because
the
father
is
with
me
16
33
these
things
i
have
spoken
unto
you
that
in
me
ye
might
have
peace
in
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulation
but
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
overcome
the
world
17
1
these
words
spake
jesus
and
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
said
father
the
hour
is
come
glorify
thy
son
that
thy
son
also
may
glorify
thee
17
2
as
thou
hast
given
him
power
over
all
flesh
that
he
should
give
eternal
life
to
as
many
as
thou
hast
given
him
17
3
and
this
is
life
eternal
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
17
4
i
have
glorified
thee
on
the
earth
i
have
finished
the
work
which
thou
gavest
me
to
do
17
5
and
now
o
father
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
before
the
world
was
17
6
i
have
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
which
thou
gavest
me
out
of
the
world
thine
they
were
and
thou
gavest
them
me
and
they
have
kept
thy
word
17
7
now
they
have
known
that
all
things
whatsoever
thou
hast
given
me
are
of
thee
17
8
for
i
have
given
unto
them
the
words
which
thou
gavest
me
and
they
have
received
them
and
have
known
surely
that
i
came
out
from
thee
and
they
have
believed
that
thou
didst
send
me
17
9
i
pray
for
them
i
pray
not
for
the
world
but
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
me
for
they
are
thine
17
10
and
all
mine
are
thine
and
thine
are
mine
and
i
am
glorified
in
them
17
11
and
now
i
am
no
more
in
the
world
but
these
are
in
the
world
and
i
come
to
thee
holy
father
keep
through
thine
own
name
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me
that
they
may
be
one
as
we
are
17
12
while
i
was
with
them
in
the
world
i
kept
them
in
thy
name
those
that
thou
gavest
me
i
have
kept
and
none
of
them
is
lost
but
the
son
of
perdition
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
17
13
and
now
come
i
to
thee
and
these
things
i
speak
in
the
world
that
they
might
have
my
joy
fulfilled
in
themselves
17
14
i
have
given
them
thy
word
and
the
world
hath
hated
them
because
they
are
not
of
the
world
even
as
i
am
not
of
the
world
17
15
i
pray
not
that
thou
shouldest
take
them
out
of
the
world
but
that
thou
shouldest
keep
them
from
the
evil
17
16
they
are
not
of
the
world
even
as
i
am
not
of
the
world
17
17
sanctify
them
through
thy
truth
thy
word
is
truth
17
18
as
thou
hast
sent
me
into
the
world
even
so
have
i
also
sent
them
into
the
world
17
19
and
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
myself
that
they
also
might
be
sanctified
through
the
truth
17
20
neither
pray
i
for
these
alone
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on
me
through
their
word
17
21
that
they
all
may
be
one
as
thou
father
art
in
me
and
i
in
thee
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us
that
the
world
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
17
22
and
the
glory
which
thou
gavest
me
i
have
given
them
that
they
may
be
one
even
as
we
are
one
17
23
i
in
them
and
thou
in
me
that
they
may
be
made
perfect
in
one
and
that
the
world
may
know
that
thou
hast
sent
me
and
hast
loved
them
as
thou
hast
loved
me
17
24
father
i
will
that
they
also
whom
thou
hast
given
me
be
with
me
where
i
am
that
they
may
behold
my
glory
which
thou
hast
given
me
for
thou
lovedst
me
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
17
25
o
righteous
father
the
world
hath
not
known
thee
but
i
have
known
thee
and
these
have
known
that
thou
hast
sent
me
17
26
and
i
have
declared
unto
them
thy
name
and
will
declare
it
that
the
love
wherewith
thou
hast
loved
me
may
be
in
them
and
i
in
them
18
1
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
went
forth
with
his
disciples
over
the
brook
cedron
where
was
a
garden
into
the
which
he
entered
and
his
disciples
18
2
and
judas
also
which
betrayed
him
knew
the
place
for
jesus
ofttimes
resorted
thither
with
his
disciples
18
3
judas
then
having
received
a
band
of
men
and
officers
from
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
cometh
thither
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
18
4
jesus
therefore
knowing
all
things
that
should
come
upon
him
went
forth
and
said
unto
them
whom
seek
ye
18
5
they
answered
him
jesus
of
nazareth
jesus
saith
unto
them
i
am
he
and
judas
also
which
betrayed
him
stood
with
them
18
6
as
soon
then
as
he
had
said
unto
them
i
am
he
they
went
backward
and
fell
to
the
ground
18
7
then
asked
he
them
again
whom
seek
ye
and
they
said
jesus
of
nazareth
18
8
jesus
answered
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
he
if
therefore
ye
seek
me
let
these
go
their
way
18
9
that
the
saying
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spake
of
them
which
thou
gavest
me
have
i
lost
none
18
10
then
simon
peter
having
a
sword
drew
it
and
smote
the
high
priest’s
servant
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
the
servant’s
name
was
malchus
18
11
then
said
jesus
unto
peter
put
up
thy
sword
into
the
sheath
the
cup
which
my
father
hath
given
me
shall
i
not
drink
it
18
12
then
the
band
and
the
captain
and
officers
of
the
jews
took
jesus
and
bound
him
18
13
and
led
him
away
to
annas
first
for
he
was
father
in
law
to
caiaphas
which
was
the
high
priest
that
same
year
18
14
now
caiaphas
was
he
which
gave
counsel
to
the
jews
that
it
was
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
18
15
and
simon
peter
followed
jesus
and
so
did
another
disciple
that
disciple
was
known
unto
the
high
priest
and
went
in
with
jesus
into
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
18
16
but
peter
stood
at
the
door
without
then
went
out
that
other
disciple
which
was
known
unto
the
high
priest
and
spake
unto
her
that
kept
the
door
and
brought
in
peter
18
17
then
saith
the
damsel
that
kept
the
door
unto
peter
art
not
thou
also
one
of
this
man’s
disciples
he
saith
i
am
not
18
18
and
the
servants
and
officers
stood
there
who
had
made
a
fire
of
coals
for
it
was
cold
and
they
warmed
themselves
and
peter
stood
with
them
and
warmed
himself
18
19
the
high
priest
then
asked
jesus
of
his
disciples
and
of
his
doctrine
18
20
jesus
answered
him
i
spake
openly
to
the
world
i
ever
taught
in
the
synagogue
and
in
the
temple
whither
the
jews
always
resort
and
in
secret
have
i
said
nothing
18
21
why
askest
thou
me
ask
them
which
heard
me
what
i
have
said
unto
them
behold
they
know
what
i
said
18
22
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
one
of
the
officers
which
stood
by
struck
jesus
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
saying
answerest
thou
the
high
priest
so
18
23
jesus
answered
him
if
i
have
spoken
evil
bear
witness
of
the
evil
but
if
well
why
smitest
thou
me
18
24
now
annas
had
sent
him
bound
unto
caiaphas
the
high
priest
18
25
and
simon
peter
stood
and
warmed
himself
they
said
therefore
unto
him
art
not
thou
also
one
of
his
disciples
he
denied
it
and
said
i
am
not
18
26
one
of
the
servants
of
the
high
priest
being
his
kinsman
whose
ear
peter
cut
off
saith
did
not
i
see
thee
in
the
garden
with
him
18
27
peter
then
denied
again
and
immediately
the
cock
crew
18
28
then
led
they
jesus
from
caiaphas
unto
the
hall
of
judgment
and
it
was
early
and
they
themselves
went
not
into
the
judgment
hall
lest
they
should
be
defiled
but
that
they
might
eat
the
passover
18
29
pilate
then
went
out
unto
them
and
said
what
accusation
bring
ye
against
this
man
18
30
they
answered
and
said
unto
him
if
he
were
not
a
malefactor
we
would
not
have
delivered
him
up
unto
thee
18
31
then
said
pilate
unto
them
take
ye
him
and
judge
him
according
to
your
law
the
jews
therefore
said
unto
him
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
put
any
man
to
death
18
32
that
the
saying
of
jesus
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spake
signifying
what
death
he
should
die
18
33
then
pilate
entered
into
the
judgment
hall
again
and
called
jesus
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
18
34
jesus
answered
him
sayest
thou
this
thing
of
thyself
or
did
others
tell
it
thee
of
me
18
35
pilate
answered
am
i
a
jew
thine
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
have
delivered
thee
unto
me
what
hast
thou
done
18
36
jesus
answered
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
if
my
kingdom
were
of
this
world
then
would
my
servants
fight
that
i
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
jews
but
now
is
my
kingdom
not
from
hence
18
37
pilate
therefore
said
unto
him
art
thou
a
king
then
jesus
answered
thou
sayest
that
i
am
a
king
to
this
end
was
i
born
and
for
this
cause
came
i
into
the
world
that
i
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth
every
one
that
is
of
the
truth
heareth
my
voice
18
38
pilate
saith
unto
him
what
is
truth
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
went
out
again
unto
the
jews
and
saith
unto
them
i
find
in
him
no
fault
at
all
18
39
but
ye
have
a
custom
that
i
should
release
unto
you
one
at
the
passover
will
ye
therefore
that
i
release
unto
you
the
king
of
the
jews
18
40
then
cried
they
all
again
saying
not
this
man
but
barabbas
now
barabbas
was
a
robber
19
1
then
pilate
therefore
took
jesus
and
scourged
him
19
2
and
the
soldiers
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
they
put
on
him
a
purple
robe
19
3
and
said
hail
king
of
the
jews
and
they
smote
him
with
their
hands
19
4
pilate
therefore
went
forth
again
and
saith
unto
them
behold
i
bring
him
forth
to
you
that
ye
may
know
that
i
find
no
fault
in
him
19
5
then
came
jesus
forth
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns
and
the
purple
robe
and
pilate
saith
unto
them
behold
the
man
19
6
when
the
chief
priests
therefore
and
officers
saw
him
they
cried
out
saying
crucify
him
crucify
him
pilate
saith
unto
them
take
ye
him
and
crucify
him
for
i
find
no
fault
in
him
19
7
the
jews
answered
him
we
have
a
law
and
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die
because
he
made
himself
the
son
of
god
19
8
when
pilate
therefore
heard
that
saying
he
was
the
more
afraid
19
9
and
went
again
into
the
judgment
hall
and
saith
unto
jesus
whence
art
thou
but
jesus
gave
him
no
answer
19
10
then
saith
pilate
unto
him
speakest
thou
not
unto
me
knowest
thou
not
that
i
have
power
to
crucify
thee
and
have
power
to
release
thee
19
11
jesus
answered
thou
couldest
have
no
power
at
all
against
me
except
it
were
given
thee
from
above
therefore
he
that
delivered
me
unto
thee
hath
the
greater
sin
19
12
and
from
thenceforth
pilate
sought
to
release
him
but
the
jews
cried
out
saying
if
thou
let
this
man
go
thou
art
not
caesar’s
friend
whosoever
maketh
himself
a
king
speaketh
against
caesar
19
13
when
pilate
therefore
heard
that
saying
he
brought
jesus
forth
and
sat
down
in
the
judgment
seat
in
a
place
that
is
called
the
pavement
but
in
the
hebrew
gabbatha
19
14
and
it
was
the
preparation
of
the
passover
and
about
the
sixth
hour
and
he
saith
unto
the
jews
behold
your
king
19
15
but
they
cried
out
away
with
him
away
with
him
crucify
him
pilate
saith
unto
them
shall
i
crucify
your
king
the
chief
priests
answered
we
have
no
king
but
caesar
19
16
then
delivered
he
him
therefore
unto
them
to
be
crucified
and
they
took
jesus
and
led
him
away
19
17
and
he
bearing
his
cross
went
forth
into
a
place
called
the
place
of
a
skull
which
is
called
in
the
hebrew
golgotha
19
18
where
they
crucified
him
and
two
other
with
him
on
either
side
one
and
jesus
in
the
midst
19
19
and
pilate
wrote
a
title
and
put
it
on
the
cross
and
the
writing
was
jesus
of
nazareth
the
king
of
the
jews
19
20
this
title
then
read
many
of
the
jews
for
the
place
where
jesus
was
crucified
was
nigh
to
the
city
and
it
was
written
in
hebrew
and
greek
and
latin
19
21
then
said
the
chief
priests
of
the
jews
to
pilate
write
not
the
king
of
the
jews
but
that
he
said
i
am
king
of
the
jews
19
22
pilate
answered
what
i
have
written
i
have
written
19
23
then
the
soldiers
when
they
had
crucified
jesus
took
his
garments
and
made
four
parts
to
every
soldier
a
part
and
also
his
coat
now
the
coat
was
without
seam
woven
from
the
top
throughout
19
24
they
said
therefore
among
themselves
let
us
not
rend
it
but
cast
lots
for
it
whose
it
shall
be
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
which
saith
they
parted
my
raiment
among
them
and
for
my
vesture
they
did
cast
lots
these
things
therefore
the
soldiers
did
19
25
now
there
stood
by
the
cross
of
jesus
his
mother
and
his
mother’s
sister
mary
the
wife
of
cleophas
and
mary
magdalene
19
26
when
jesus
therefore
saw
his
mother
and
the
disciple
standing
by
whom
he
loved
he
saith
unto
his
mother
woman
behold
thy
son
19
27
then
saith
he
to
the
disciple
behold
thy
mother
and
from
that
hour
that
disciple
took
her
unto
his
own
home
19
28
after
this
jesus
knowing
that
all
things
were
now
accomplished
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
saith
i
thirst
19
29
now
there
was
set
a
vessel
full
of
vinegar
and
they
filled
a
spunge
with
vinegar
and
put
it
upon
hyssop
and
put
it
to
his
mouth
19
30
when
jesus
therefore
had
received
the
vinegar
he
said
it
is
finished
and
he
bowed
his
head
and
gave
up
the
ghost
19
31
the
jews
therefore
because
it
was
the
preparation
that
the
bodies
should
not
remain
upon
the
cross
on
the
sabbath
day
(for
that
sabbath
day
was
an
high
day
)
besought
pilate
that
their
legs
might
be
broken
and
that
they
might
be
taken
away
19
32
then
came
the
soldiers
and
brake
the
legs
of
the
first
and
of
the
other
which
was
crucified
with
him
19
33
but
when
they
came
to
jesus
and
saw
that
he
was
dead
already
they
brake
not
his
legs
19
34
but
one
of
the
soldiers
with
a
spear
pierced
his
side
and
forthwith
came
there
out
blood
and
water
19
35
and
he
that
saw
it
bare
record
and
his
record
is
true
and
he
knoweth
that
he
saith
true
that
ye
might
believe
19
36
for
these
things
were
done
that
the
scripture
should
be
fulfilled
a
bone
of
him
shall
not
be
broken
19
37
and
again
another
scripture
saith
they
shall
look
on
him
whom
they
pierced
19
38
and
after
this
joseph
of
arimathaea
being
a
disciple
of
jesus
but
secretly
for
fear
of
the
jews
besought
pilate
that
he
might
take
away
the
body
of
jesus
and
pilate
gave
him
leave
he
came
therefore
and
took
the
body
of
jesus
19
39
and
there
came
also
nicodemus
which
at
the
first
came
to
jesus
by
night
and
brought
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
about
an
hundred
pound
weight
19
40
then
took
they
the
body
of
jesus
and
wound
it
in
linen
clothes
with
the
spices
as
the
manner
of
the
jews
is
to
bury
19
41
now
in
the
place
where
he
was
crucified
there
was
a
garden
and
in
the
garden
a
new
sepulchre
wherein
was
never
man
yet
laid
19
42
there
laid
they
jesus
therefore
because
of
the
jews’
preparation
day
for
the
sepulchre
was
nigh
at
hand
20
1
the
first
day
of
the
week
cometh
mary
magdalene
early
when
it
was
yet
dark
unto
the
sepulchre
and
seeth
the
stone
taken
away
from
the
sepulchre
20
2
then
she
runneth
and
cometh
to
simon
peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
and
saith
unto
them
they
have
taken
away
the
lord
out
of
the
sepulchre
and
we
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
20
3
peter
therefore
went
forth
and
that
other
disciple
and
came
to
the
sepulchre
20
4
so
they
ran
both
together
and
the
other
disciple
did
outrun
peter
and
came
first
to
the
sepulchre
20
5
and
he
stooping
down
and
looking
in
saw
the
linen
clothes
lying
yet
went
he
not
in
20
6
then
cometh
simon
peter
following
him
and
went
into
the
sepulchre
and
seeth
the
linen
clothes
lie
20
7
and
the
napkin
that
was
about
his
head
not
lying
with
the
linen
clothes
but
wrapped
together
in
a
place
by
itself
20
8
then
went
in
also
that
other
disciple
which
came
first
to
the
sepulchre
and
he
saw
and
believed
20
9
for
as
yet
they
knew
not
the
scripture
that
he
must
rise
again
from
the
dead
20
10
then
the
disciples
went
away
again
unto
their
own
home
20
11
but
mary
stood
without
at
the
sepulchre
weeping
and
as
she
wept
she
stooped
down
and
looked
into
the
sepulchre
20
12
and
seeth
two
angels
in
white
sitting
the
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
feet
where
the
body
of
jesus
had
lain
20
13
and
they
say
unto
her
woman
why
weepest
thou
she
saith
unto
them
because
they
have
taken
away
my
lord
and
i
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
20
14
and
when
she
had
thus
said
she
turned
herself
back
and
saw
jesus
standing
and
knew
not
that
it
was
jesus
20
15
jesus
saith
unto
her
woman
why
weepest
thou
whom
seekest
thou
she
supposing
him
to
be
the
gardener
saith
unto
him
sir
if
thou
have
borne
him
hence
tell
me
where
thou
hast
laid
him
and
i
will
take
him
away
20
16
jesus
saith
unto
her
mary
she
turned
herself
and
saith
unto
him
rabboni
which
is
to
say
master
20
17
jesus
saith
unto
her
touch
me
not
for
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
to
my
brethren
and
say
unto
them
i
ascend
unto
my
father
and
your
father
and
to
my
god
and
your
god
20
18
mary
magdalene
came
and
told
the
disciples
that
she
had
seen
the
lord
and
that
he
had
spoken
these
things
unto
her
20
19
then
the
same
day
at
evening
being
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
the
doors
were
shut
where
the
disciples
were
assembled
for
fear
of
the
jews
came
jesus
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
saith
unto
them
peace
be
unto
you
20
20
and
when
he
had
so
said
he
shewed
unto
them
his
hands
and
his
side
then
were
the
disciples
glad
when
they
saw
the
lord
20
21
then
said
jesus
to
them
again
peace
be
unto
you
as
my
father
hath
sent
me
even
so
send
i
you
20
22
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
breathed
on
them
and
saith
unto
them
receive
ye
the
holy
ghost
20
23
whose
soever
sins
ye
remit
they
are
remitted
unto
them
and
whose
soever
sins
ye
retain
they
are
retained
20
24
but
thomas
one
of
the
twelve
called
didymus
was
not
with
them
when
jesus
came
20
25
the
other
disciples
therefore
said
unto
him
we
have
seen
the
lord
but
he
said
unto
them
except
i
shall
see
in
his
hands
the
print
of
the
nails
and
put
my
finger
into
the
print
of
the
nails
and
thrust
my
hand
into
his
side
i
will
not
believe
20
26
and
after
eight
days
again
his
disciples
were
within
and
thomas
with
them
then
came
jesus
the
doors
being
shut
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
said
peace
be
unto
you
20
27
then
saith
he
to
thomas
reach
hither
thy
finger
and
behold
my
hands
and
reach
hither
thy
hand
and
thrust
it
into
my
side
and
be
not
faithless
but
believing
20
28
and
thomas
answered
and
said
unto
him
my
lord
and
my
god
20
29
jesus
saith
unto
him
thomas
because
thou
hast
seen
me
thou
hast
believed
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
20
30
and
many
other
signs
truly
did
jesus
in
the
presence
of
his
disciples
which
are
not
written
in
this
book
20
31
but
these
are
written
that
ye
might
believe
that
jesus
is
the
christ
the
son
of
god
and
that
believing
ye
might
have
life
through
his
name
21
1
after
these
things
jesus
shewed
himself
again
to
the
disciples
at
the
sea
of
tiberias
and
on
this
wise
shewed
he
himself
21
2
there
were
together
simon
peter
and
thomas
called
didymus
and
nathanael
of
cana
in
galilee
and
the
sons
of
zebedee
and
two
other
of
his
disciples
21
3
simon
peter
saith
unto
them
i
go
a
fishing
they
say
unto
him
we
also
go
with
thee
they
went
forth
and
entered
into
a
ship
immediately
and
that
night
they
caught
nothing
21
4
but
when
the
morning
was
now
come
jesus
stood
on
the
shore
but
the
disciples
knew
not
that
it
was
jesus
21
5
then
jesus
saith
unto
them
children
have
ye
any
meat
they
answered
him
no
21
6
and
he
said
unto
them
cast
the
net
on
the
right
side
of
the
ship
and
ye
shall
find
they
cast
therefore
and
now
they
were
not
able
to
draw
it
for
the
multitude
of
fishes
21
7
therefore
that
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
saith
unto
peter
it
is
the
lord
now
when
simon
peter
heard
that
it
was
the
lord
he
girt
his
fisher’s
coat
unto
him
(for
he
was
naked
)
and
did
cast
himself
into
the
sea
21
8
and
the
other
disciples
came
in
a
little
ship
(for
they
were
not
far
from
land
but
as
it
were
two
hundred
cubits
)
dragging
the
net
with
fishes
21
9
as
soon
then
as
they
were
come
to
land
they
saw
a
fire
of
coals
there
and
fish
laid
thereon
and
bread
21
10
jesus
saith
unto
them
bring
of
the
fish
which
ye
have
now
caught
21
11
simon
peter
went
up
and
drew
the
net
to
land
full
of
great
fishes
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
and
for
all
there
were
so
many
yet
was
not
the
net
broken
21
12
jesus
saith
unto
them
come
and
dine
and
none
of
the
disciples
durst
ask
him
who
art
thou
knowing
that
it
was
the
lord
21
13
jesus
then
cometh
and
taketh
bread
and
giveth
them
and
fish
likewise
21
14
this
is
now
the
third
time
that
jesus
shewed
himself
to
his
disciples
after
that
he
was
risen
from
the
dead
21
15
so
when
they
had
dined
jesus
saith
to
simon
peter
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
more
than
these
he
saith
unto
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
unto
him
feed
my
lambs
21
16
he
saith
to
him
again
the
second
time
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
he
saith
unto
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
unto
him
feed
my
sheep
21
17
he
saith
unto
him
the
third
time
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
peter
was
grieved
because
he
said
unto
him
the
third
time
lovest
thou
me
and
he
said
unto
him
lord
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
jesus
saith
unto
him
feed
my
sheep
21
18
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
young
thou
girdest
thyself
and
walkedst
whither
thou
wouldest
but
when
thou
shalt
be
old
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thy
hands
and
another
shall
gird
thee
and
carry
thee
whither
thou
wouldest
not
21
19
this
spake
he
signifying
by
what
death
he
should
glorify
god
and
when
he
had
spoken
this
he
saith
unto
him
follow
me
21
20
then
peter
turning
about
seeth
the
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
following
which
also
leaned
on
his
breast
at
supper
and
said
lord
which
is
he
that
betrayeth
thee
21
21
peter
seeing
him
saith
to
jesus
lord
and
what
shall
this
man
do
21
22
jesus
saith
unto
him
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
come
what
is
that
to
thee
follow
thou
me
21
23
then
went
this
saying
abroad
among
the
brethren
that
that
disciple
should
not
die
yet
jesus
said
not
unto
him
he
shall
not
die
but
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
come
what
is
that
to
thee
21
24
this
is
the
disciple
which
testifieth
of
these
things
and
wrote
these
things
and
we
know
that
his
testimony
is
true
21
25
and
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
jesus
did
the
which
if
they
should
be
written
every
one
i
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
books
that
should
be
written
amen
the
acts
of
the
apostles
1
1
the
former
treatise
have
i
made
o
theophilus
of
all
that
jesus
began
both
to
do
and
teach
1
2
until
the
day
in
which
he
was
taken
up
after
that
he
through
the
holy
ghost
had
given
commandments
unto
the
apostles
whom
he
had
chosen
1
3
to
whom
also
he
shewed
himself
alive
after
his
passion
by
many
infallible
proofs
being
seen
of
them
forty
days
and
speaking
of
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
god
1
4
and
being
assembled
together
with
them
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
depart
from
jerusalem
but
wait
for
the
promise
of
the
father
which
saith
he
ye
have
heard
of
me
1
5
for
john
truly
baptized
with
water
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
not
many
days
hence
1
6
when
they
therefore
were
come
together
they
asked
of
him
saying
lord
wilt
thou
at
this
time
restore
again
the
kingdom
to
israel
1
7
and
he
said
unto
them
it
is
not
for
you
to
know
the
times
or
the
seasons
which
the
father
hath
put
in
his
own
power
1
8
but
ye
shall
receive
power
after
that
the
holy
ghost
is
come
upon
you
and
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
both
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judaea
and
in
samaria
and
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
1
9
and
when
he
had
spoken
these
things
while
they
beheld
he
was
taken
up
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
sight
1
10
and
while
they
looked
stedfastly
toward
heaven
as
he
went
up
behold
two
men
stood
by
them
in
white
apparel
1
11
which
also
said
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
this
same
jesus
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
heaven
1
12
then
returned
they
unto
jerusalem
from
the
mount
called
olivet
which
is
from
jerusalem
a
sabbath
day’s
journey
1
13
and
when
they
were
come
in
they
went
up
into
an
upper
room
where
abode
both
peter
and
james
and
john
and
andrew
philip
and
thomas
bartholomew
and
matthew
james
the
son
of
alphaeus
and
simon
zelotes
and
judas
the
brother
of
james
1
14
these
all
continued
with
one
accord
in
prayer
and
supplication
with
the
women
and
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
and
with
his
brethren
1
15
and
in
those
days
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
disciples
and
said
(the
number
of
names
together
were
about
an
hundred
and
twenty
)
1
16
men
and
brethren
this
scripture
must
needs
have
been
fulfilled
which
the
holy
ghost
by
the
mouth
of
david
spake
before
concerning
judas
which
was
guide
to
them
that
took
jesus
1
17
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
had
obtained
part
of
this
ministry
1
18
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
reward
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
asunder
in
the
midst
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
out
1
19
and
it
was
known
unto
all
the
dwellers
at
jerusalem
insomuch
as
that
field
is
called
in
their
proper
tongue
aceldama
that
is
to
say
the
field
of
blood
1
20
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
habitation
be
desolate
and
let
no
man
dwell
therein
and
his
bishoprick
let
another
take
1
21
wherefore
of
these
men
which
have
companied
with
us
all
the
time
that
the
lord
jesus
went
in
and
out
among
us
1
22
beginning
from
the
baptism
of
john
unto
that
same
day
that
he
was
taken
up
from
us
must
one
be
ordained
to
be
a
witness
with
us
of
his
resurrection
1
23
and
they
appointed
two
joseph
called
barsabas
who
was
surnamed
justus
and
matthias
1
24
and
they
prayed
and
said
thou
lord
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
men
shew
whether
of
these
two
thou
hast
chosen
1
25
that
he
may
take
part
of
this
ministry
and
apostleship
from
which
judas
by
transgression
fell
that
he
might
go
to
his
own
place
1
26
and
they
gave
forth
their
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
matthias
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles
2
1
and
when
the
day
of
pentecost
was
fully
come
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
one
place
2
2
and
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
from
heaven
as
of
a
rushing
mighty
wind
and
it
filled
all
the
house
where
they
were
sitting
2
3
and
there
appeared
unto
them
cloven
tongues
like
as
of
fire
and
it
sat
upon
each
of
them
2
4
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
began
to
speak
with
other
tongues
as
the
spirit
gave
them
utterance
2
5
and
there
were
dwelling
at
jerusalem
jews
devout
men
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
2
6
now
when
this
was
noised
abroad
the
multitude
came
together
and
were
confounded
because
that
every
man
heard
them
speak
in
his
own
language
2
7
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
marvelled
saying
one
to
another
behold
are
not
all
these
which
speak
galilaeans
2
8
and
how
hear
we
every
man
in
our
own
tongue
wherein
we
were
born
2
9
parthians
and
medes
and
elamites
and
the
dwellers
in
mesopotamia
and
in
judaea
and
cappadocia
in
pontus
and
asia
2
10
phrygia
and
pamphylia
in
egypt
and
in
the
parts
of
libya
about
cyrene
and
strangers
of
rome
jews
and
proselytes
2
11
cretes
and
arabians
we
do
hear
them
speak
in
our
tongues
the
wonderful
works
of
god
2
12
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
were
in
doubt
saying
one
to
another
what
meaneth
this
2
13
others
mocking
said
these
men
are
full
of
new
wine
2
14
but
peter
standing
up
with
the
eleven
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
unto
them
ye
men
of
judaea
and
all
ye
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
be
this
known
unto
you
and
hearken
to
my
words
2
15
for
these
are
not
drunken
as
ye
suppose
seeing
it
is
but
the
third
hour
of
the
day
2
16
but
this
is
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
joel
2
17
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
saith
god
i
will
pour
out
of
my
spirit
upon
all
flesh
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy
and
your
young
men
shall
see
visions
and
your
old
men
shall
dream
dreams
2
18
and
on
my
servants
and
on
my
handmaidens
i
will
pour
out
in
those
days
of
my
spirit
and
they
shall
prophesy
2
19
and
i
will
shew
wonders
in
heaven
above
and
signs
in
the
earth
beneath
blood
and
fire
and
vapour
of
smoke
2
20
the
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
notable
day
of
the
lord
come
2
21
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
saved
2
22
ye
men
of
israel
hear
these
words
jesus
of
nazareth
a
man
approved
of
god
among
you
by
miracles
and
wonders
and
signs
which
god
did
by
him
in
the
midst
of
you
as
ye
yourselves
also
know
2
23
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
ye
have
taken
and
by
wicked
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
2
24
whom
god
hath
raised
up
having
loosed
the
pains
of
death
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
it
2
25
for
david
speaketh
concerning
him
i
foresaw
the
lord
always
before
my
face
for
he
is
on
my
right
hand
that
i
should
not
be
moved
2
26
therefore
did
my
heart
rejoice
and
my
tongue
was
glad
moreover
also
my
flesh
shall
rest
in
hope
2
27
because
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
2
28
thou
hast
made
known
to
me
the
ways
of
life
thou
shalt
make
me
full
of
joy
with
thy
countenance
2
29
men
and
brethren
let
me
freely
speak
unto
you
of
the
patriarch
david
that
he
is
both
dead
and
buried
and
his
sepulchre
is
with
us
unto
this
day
2
30
therefore
being
a
prophet
and
knowing
that
god
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
him
that
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
according
to
the
flesh
he
would
raise
up
christ
to
sit
on
his
throne
2
31
he
seeing
this
before
spake
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
that
his
soul
was
not
left
in
hell
neither
his
flesh
did
see
corruption
2
32
this
jesus
hath
god
raised
up
whereof
we
all
are
witnesses
2
33
therefore
being
by
the
right
hand
of
god
exalted
and
having
received
of
the
father
the
promise
of
the
holy
ghost
he
hath
shed
forth
this
which
ye
now
see
and
hear
2
34
for
david
is
not
ascended
into
the
heavens
but
he
saith
himself
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
2
35
until
i
make
thy
foes
thy
footstool
2
36
therefore
let
all
the
house
of
israel
know
assuredly
that
god
hath
made
the
same
jesus
whom
ye
have
crucified
both
lord
and
christ
2
37
now
when
they
heard
this
they
were
pricked
in
their
heart
and
said
unto
peter
and
to
the
rest
of
the
apostles
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
2
38
then
peter
said
unto
them
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
2
39
for
the
promise
is
unto
you
and
to
your
children
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off
even
as
many
as
the
lord
our
god
shall
call
2
40
and
with
many
other
words
did
he
testify
and
exhort
saying
save
yourselves
from
this
untoward
generation
2
41
then
they
that
gladly
received
his
word
were
baptized
and
the
same
day
there
were
added
unto
them
about
three
thousand
souls
2
42
and
they
continued
stedfastly
in
the
apostles’
doctrine
and
fellowship
and
in
breaking
of
bread
and
in
prayers
2
43
and
fear
came
upon
every
soul
and
many
wonders
and
signs
were
done
by
the
apostles
2
44
and
all
that
believed
were
together
and
had
all
things
common
2
45
and
sold
their
possessions
and
goods
and
parted
them
to
all
men
as
every
man
had
need
2
46
and
they
continuing
daily
with
one
accord
in
the
temple
and
breaking
bread
from
house
to
house
did
eat
their
meat
with
gladness
and
singleness
of
heart
2
47
praising
god
and
having
favour
with
all
the
people
and
the
lord
added
to
the
church
daily
such
as
should
be
saved
3
1
now
peter
and
john
went
up
together
into
the
temple
at
the
hour
of
prayer
being
the
ninth
hour
3
2
and
a
certain
man
lame
from
his
mother’s
womb
was
carried
whom
they
laid
daily
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
which
is
called
beautiful
to
ask
alms
of
them
that
entered
into
the
temple
3
3
who
seeing
peter
and
john
about
to
go
into
the
temple
asked
an
alms
3
4
and
peter
fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
with
john
said
look
on
us
3
5
and
he
gave
heed
unto
them
expecting
to
receive
something
of
them
3
6
then
peter
said
silver
and
gold
have
i
none
but
such
as
i
have
give
i
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
rise
up
and
walk
3
7
and
he
took
him
by
the
right
hand
and
lifted
him
up
and
immediately
his
feet
and
ankle
bones
received
strength
3
8
and
he
leaping
up
stood
and
walked
and
entered
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
god
3
9
and
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
god
3
10
and
they
knew
that
it
was
he
which
sat
for
alms
at
the
beautiful
gate
of
the
temple
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
that
which
had
happened
unto
him
3
11
and
as
the
lame
man
which
was
healed
held
peter
and
john
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
in
the
porch
that
is
called
solomon’s
greatly
wondering
3
12
and
when
peter
saw
it
he
answered
unto
the
people
ye
men
of
israel
why
marvel
ye
at
this
or
why
look
ye
so
earnestly
on
us
as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
walk
3
13
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
glorified
his
son
jesus
whom
ye
delivered
up
and
denied
him
in
the
presence
of
pilate
when
he
was
determined
to
let
him
go
3
14
but
ye
denied
the
holy
one
and
the
just
and
desired
a
murderer
to
be
granted
unto
you
3
15
and
killed
the
prince
of
life
whom
god
hath
raised
from
the
dead
whereof
we
are
witnesses
3
16
and
his
name
through
faith
in
his
name
hath
made
this
man
strong
whom
ye
see
and
know
yea
the
faith
which
is
by
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you
all
3
17
and
now
brethren
i
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
it
as
did
also
your
rulers
3
18
but
those
things
which
god
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
that
christ
should
suffer
he
hath
so
fulfilled
3
19
repent
ye
therefore
and
be
converted
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
out
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
3
20
and
he
shall
send
jesus
christ
which
before
was
preached
unto
you
3
21
whom
the
heaven
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
things
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
3
22
for
moses
truly
said
unto
the
fathers
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
3
23
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
people
3
24
yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
those
that
follow
after
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
days
3
25
ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
our
fathers
saying
unto
abraham
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
3
26
unto
you
first
god
having
raised
up
his
son
jesus
sent
him
to
bless
you
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
iniquities
4
1
and
as
they
spake
unto
the
people
the
priests
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
sadducees
came
upon
them
4
2
being
grieved
that
they
taught
the
people
and
preached
through
jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
4
3
and
they
laid
hands
on
them
and
put
them
in
hold
unto
the
next
day
for
it
was
now
eventide
4
4
howbeit
many
of
them
which
heard
the
word
believed
and
the
number
of
the
men
was
about
five
thousand
4
5
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
their
rulers
and
elders
and
scribes
4
6
and
annas
the
high
priest
and
caiaphas
and
john
and
alexander
and
as
many
as
were
of
the
kindred
of
the
high
priest
were
gathered
together
at
jerusalem
4
7
and
when
they
had
set
them
in
the
midst
they
asked
by
what
power
or
by
what
name
have
ye
done
this
4
8
then
peter
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
said
unto
them
ye
rulers
of
the
people
and
elders
of
israel
4
9
if
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent
man
by
what
means
he
is
made
whole
4
10
be
it
known
unto
you
all
and
to
all
the
people
of
israel
that
by
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
whom
ye
crucified
whom
god
raised
from
the
dead
even
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole
4
11
this
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
nought
of
you
builders
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
4
12
neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
other
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
4
13
now
when
they
saw
the
boldness
of
peter
and
john
and
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
men
they
marvelled
and
they
took
knowledge
of
them
that
they
had
been
with
jesus
4
14
and
beholding
the
man
which
was
healed
standing
with
them
they
could
say
nothing
against
it
4
15
but
when
they
had
commanded
them
to
go
aside
out
of
the
council
they
conferred
among
themselves
4
16
saying
what
shall
we
do
to
these
men
for
that
indeed
a
notable
miracle
hath
been
done
by
them
is
manifest
to
all
them
that
dwell
in
jerusalem
and
we
cannot
deny
it
4
17
but
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the
people
let
us
straitly
threaten
them
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
this
name
4
18
and
they
called
them
and
commanded
them
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
4
19
but
peter
and
john
answered
and
said
unto
them
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
4
20
for
we
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
4
21
so
when
they
had
further
threatened
them
they
let
them
go
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
them
because
of
the
people
for
all
men
glorified
god
for
that
which
was
done
4
22
for
the
man
was
above
forty
years
old
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
was
shewed
4
23
and
being
let
go
they
went
to
their
own
company
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
unto
them
4
24
and
when
they
heard
that
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
god
with
one
accord
and
said
lord
thou
art
god
which
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
4
25
who
by
the
mouth
of
thy
servant
david
hast
said
why
did
the
heathen
rage
and
the
people
imagine
vain
things
4
26
the
kings
of
the
earth
stood
up
and
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
christ
4
27
for
of
a
truth
against
thy
holy
child
jesus
whom
thou
hast
anointed
both
herod
and
pontius
pilate
with
the
gentiles
and
the
people
of
israel
were
gathered
together
4
28
for
to
do
whatsoever
thy
hand
and
thy
counsel
determined
before
to
be
done
4
29
and
now
lord
behold
their
threatenings
and
grant
unto
thy
servants
that
with
all
boldness
they
may
speak
thy
word
4
30
by
stretching
forth
thine
hand
to
heal
and
that
signs
and
wonders
may
be
done
by
the
name
of
thy
holy
child
jesus
4
31
and
when
they
had
prayed
the
place
was
shaken
where
they
were
assembled
together
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
boldness
4
32
and
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
soul
neither
said
any
of
them
that
ought
of
the
things
which
he
possessed
was
his
own
but
they
had
all
things
common
4
33
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
the
lord
jesus
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
all
4
34
neither
was
there
any
among
them
that
lacked
for
as
many
as
were
possessors
of
lands
or
houses
sold
them
and
brought
the
prices
of
the
things
that
were
sold
4
35
and
laid
them
down
at
the
apostles’
feet
and
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
according
as
he
had
need
4
36
and
joses
who
by
the
apostles
was
surnamed
barnabas
(which
is
being
interpreted
the
son
of
consolation
)
a
levite
and
of
the
country
of
cyprus
4
37
having
land
sold
it
and
brought
the
money
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles’
feet
5
1
but
a
certain
man
named
ananias
with
sapphira
his
wife
sold
a
possession
5
2
and
kept
back
part
of
the
price
his
wife
also
being
privy
to
it
and
brought
a
certain
part
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles’
feet
5
3
but
peter
said
ananias
why
hath
satan
filled
thine
heart
to
lie
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
keep
back
part
of
the
price
of
the
land
5
4
whiles
it
remained
was
it
not
thine
own
and
after
it
was
sold
was
it
not
in
thine
own
power
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thine
heart
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
god
5
5
and
ananias
hearing
these
words
fell
down
and
gave
up
the
ghost
and
great
fear
came
on
all
them
that
heard
these
things
5
6
and
the
young
men
arose
wound
him
up
and
carried
him
out
and
buried
him
5
7
and
it
was
about
the
space
of
three
hours
after
when
his
wife
not
knowing
what
was
done
came
in
5
8
and
peter
answered
unto
her
tell
me
whether
ye
sold
the
land
for
so
much
and
she
said
yea
for
so
much
5
9
then
peter
said
unto
her
how
is
it
that
ye
have
agreed
together
to
tempt
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
the
feet
of
them
which
have
buried
thy
husband
are
at
the
door
and
shall
carry
thee
out
5
10
then
fell
she
down
straightway
at
his
feet
and
yielded
up
the
ghost
and
the
young
men
came
in
and
found
her
dead
and
carrying
her
forth
buried
her
by
her
husband
5
11
and
great
fear
came
upon
all
the
church
and
upon
as
many
as
heard
these
things
5
12
and
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
were
many
signs
and
wonders
wrought
among
the
people
(and
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
solomon’s
porch
5
13
and
of
the
rest
durst
no
man
join
himself
to
them
but
the
people
magnified
them
5
14
and
believers
were
the
more
added
to
the
lord
multitudes
both
of
men
and
women
)
5
15
insomuch
that
they
brought
forth
the
sick
into
the
streets
and
laid
them
on
beds
and
couches
that
at
the
least
the
shadow
of
peter
passing
by
might
overshadow
some
of
them
5
16
there
came
also
a
multitude
out
of
the
cities
round
about
unto
jerusalem
bringing
sick
folks
and
them
which
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits
and
they
were
healed
every
one
5
17
then
the
high
priest
rose
up
and
all
they
that
were
with
him
(which
is
the
sect
of
the
sadducees
)
and
were
filled
with
indignation
5
18
and
laid
their
hands
on
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
the
common
prison
5
19
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
by
night
opened
the
prison
doors
and
brought
them
forth
and
said
5
20
go
stand
and
speak
in
the
temple
to
the
people
all
the
words
of
this
life
5
21
and
when
they
heard
that
they
entered
into
the
temple
early
in
the
morning
and
taught
but
the
high
priest
came
and
they
that
were
with
him
and
called
the
council
together
and
all
the
senate
of
the
children
of
israel
and
sent
to
the
prison
to
have
them
brought
5
22
but
when
the
officers
came
and
found
them
not
in
the
prison
they
returned
and
told
5
23
saying
the
prison
truly
found
we
shut
with
all
safety
and
the
keepers
standing
without
before
the
doors
but
when
we
had
opened
we
found
no
man
within
5
24
now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
things
they
doubted
of
them
whereunto
this
would
grow
5
25
then
came
one
and
told
them
saying
behold
the
men
whom
ye
put
in
prison
are
standing
in
the
temple
and
teaching
the
people
5
26
then
went
the
captain
with
the
officers
and
brought
them
without
violence
for
they
feared
the
people
lest
they
should
have
been
stoned
5
27
and
when
they
had
brought
them
they
set
them
before
the
council
and
the
high
priest
asked
them
5
28
saying
did
not
we
straitly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
name
and
behold
ye
have
filled
jerusalem
with
your
doctrine
and
intend
to
bring
this
man’s
blood
upon
us
5
29
then
peter
and
the
other
apostles
answered
and
said
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
5
30
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
jesus
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
5
31
him
hath
god
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
prince
and
a
saviour
for
to
give
repentance
to
israel
and
forgiveness
of
sins
5
32
and
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
things
and
so
is
also
the
holy
ghost
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
him
5
33
when
they
heard
that
they
were
cut
to
the
heart
and
took
counsel
to
slay
them
5
34
then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
council
a
pharisee
named
gamaliel
a
doctor
of
the
law
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
people
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
space
5
35
and
said
unto
them
ye
men
of
israel
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
men
5
36
for
before
these
days
rose
up
theudas
boasting
himself
to
be
somebody
to
whom
a
number
of
men
about
four
hundred
joined
themselves
who
was
slain
and
all
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
scattered
and
brought
to
nought
5
37
after
this
man
rose
up
judas
of
galilee
in
the
days
of
the
taxing
and
drew
away
much
people
after
him
he
also
perished
and
all
even
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
dispersed
5
38
and
now
i
say
unto
you
refrain
from
these
men
and
let
them
alone
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
men
it
will
come
to
nought
5
39
but
if
it
be
of
god
ye
cannot
overthrow
it
lest
haply
ye
be
found
even
to
fight
against
god
5
40
and
to
him
they
agreed
and
when
they
had
called
the
apostles
and
beaten
them
they
commanded
that
they
should
not
speak
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
let
them
go
5
41
and
they
departed
from
the
presence
of
the
council
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
name
5
42
and
daily
in
the
temple
and
in
every
house
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
jesus
christ
6
1
and
in
those
days
when
the
number
of
the
disciples
was
multiplied
there
arose
a
murmuring
of
the
grecians
against
the
hebrews
because
their
widows
were
neglected
in
the
daily
ministration
6
2
then
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
unto
them
and
said
it
is
not
reason
that
we
should
leave
the
word
of
god
and
serve
tables
6
3
wherefore
brethren
look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
report
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
wisdom
whom
we
may
appoint
over
this
business
6
4
but
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
prayer
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
word
6
5
and
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
multitude
and
they
chose
stephen
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
philip
and
prochorus
and
nicanor
and
timon
and
parmenas
and
nicolas
a
proselyte
of
antioch
6
6
whom
they
set
before
the
apostles
and
when
they
had
prayed
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
6
7
and
the
word
of
god
increased
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
multiplied
in
jerusalem
greatly
and
a
great
company
of
the
priests
were
obedient
to
the
faith
6
8
and
stephen
full
of
faith
and
power
did
great
wonders
and
miracles
among
the
people
6
9
then
there
arose
certain
of
the
synagogue
which
is
called
the
synagogue
of
the
libertines
and
cyrenians
and
alexandrians
and
of
them
of
cilicia
and
of
asia
disputing
with
stephen
6
10
and
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
by
which
he
spake
6
11
then
they
suborned
men
which
said
we
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
moses
and
against
god
6
12
and
they
stirred
up
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
came
upon
him
and
caught
him
and
brought
him
to
the
council
6
13
and
set
up
false
witnesses
which
said
this
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
place
and
the
law
6
14
for
we
have
heard
him
say
that
this
jesus
of
nazareth
shall
destroy
this
place
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
moses
delivered
us
6
15
and
all
that
sat
in
the
council
looking
stedfastly
on
him
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
7
1
then
said
the
high
priest
are
these
things
so
7
2
and
he
said
men
brethren
and
fathers
hearken
the
god
of
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
abraham
when
he
was
in
mesopotamia
before
he
dwelt
in
charran
7
3
and
said
unto
him
get
thee
out
of
thy
country
and
from
thy
kindred
and
come
into
the
land
which
i
shall
shew
thee
7
4
then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
chaldaeans
and
dwelt
in
charran
and
from
thence
when
his
father
was
dead
he
removed
him
into
this
land
wherein
ye
now
dwell
7
5
and
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
it
no
not
so
much
as
to
set
his
foot
on
yet
he
promised
that
he
would
give
it
to
him
for
a
possession
and
to
his
seed
after
him
when
as
yet
he
had
no
child
7
6
and
god
spake
on
this
wise
that
his
seed
should
sojourn
in
a
strange
land
and
that
they
should
bring
them
into
bondage
and
entreat
them
evil
four
hundred
years
7
7
and
the
nation
to
whom
they
shall
be
in
bondage
will
i
judge
said
god
and
after
that
shall
they
come
forth
and
serve
me
in
this
place
7
8
and
he
gave
him
the
covenant
of
circumcision
and
so
abraham
begat
isaac
and
circumcised
him
the
eighth
day
and
isaac
begat
jacob
and
jacob
begat
the
twelve
patriarchs
7
9
and
the
patriarchs
moved
with
envy
sold
joseph
into
egypt
but
god
was
with
him
7
10
and
delivered
him
out
of
all
his
afflictions
and
gave
him
favour
and
wisdom
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
he
made
him
governor
over
egypt
and
all
his
house
7
11
now
there
came
a
dearth
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
and
chanaan
and
great
affliction
and
our
fathers
found
no
sustenance
7
12
but
when
jacob
heard
that
there
was
corn
in
egypt
he
sent
out
our
fathers
first
7
13
and
at
the
second
time
joseph
was
made
known
to
his
brethren
and
joseph’s
kindred
was
made
known
unto
pharaoh
7
14
then
sent
joseph
and
called
his
father
jacob
to
him
and
all
his
kindred
threescore
and
fifteen
souls
7
15
so
jacob
went
down
into
egypt
and
died
he
and
our
fathers
7
16
and
were
carried
over
into
sychem
and
laid
in
the
sepulchre
that
abraham
bought
for
a
sum
of
money
of
the
sons
of
emmor
the
father
of
sychem
7
17
but
when
the
time
of
the
promise
drew
nigh
which
god
had
sworn
to
abraham
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
in
egypt
7
18
till
another
king
arose
which
knew
not
joseph
7
19
the
same
dealt
subtilly
with
our
kindred
and
evil
entreated
our
fathers
so
that
they
cast
out
their
young
children
to
the
end
they
might
not
live
7
20
in
which
time
moses
was
born
and
was
exceeding
fair
and
nourished
up
in
his
father’s
house
three
months
7
21
and
when
he
was
cast
out
pharaoh’s
daughter
took
him
up
and
nourished
him
for
her
own
son
7
22
and
moses
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
and
was
mighty
in
words
and
in
deeds
7
23
and
when
he
was
full
forty
years
old
it
came
into
his
heart
to
visit
his
brethren
the
children
of
israel
7
24
and
seeing
one
of
them
suffer
wrong
he
defended
him
and
avenged
him
that
was
oppressed
and
smote
the
egyptian
7
25
for
he
supposed
his
brethren
would
have
understood
how
that
god
by
his
hand
would
deliver
them
but
they
understood
not
7
26
and
the
next
day
he
shewed
himself
unto
them
as
they
strove
and
would
have
set
them
at
one
again
saying
sirs
ye
are
brethren
why
do
ye
wrong
one
to
another
7
27
but
he
that
did
his
neighbour
wrong
thrust
him
away
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
over
us
7
28
wilt
thou
kill
me
as
thou
diddest
the
egyptian
yesterday
7
29
then
fled
moses
at
this
saying
and
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
of
madian
where
he
begat
two
sons
7
30
and
when
forty
years
were
expired
there
appeared
to
him
in
the
wilderness
of
mount
sina
an
angel
of
the
lord
in
a
flame
of
fire
in
a
bush
7
31
when
moses
saw
it
he
wondered
at
the
sight
and
as
he
drew
near
to
behold
it
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
7
32
saying
i
am
the
god
of
thy
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
then
moses
trembled
and
durst
not
behold
7
33
then
said
the
lord
to
him
put
off
thy
shoes
from
thy
feet
for
the
place
where
thou
standest
is
holy
ground
7
34
i
have
seen
i
have
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
is
in
egypt
and
i
have
heard
their
groaning
and
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
and
now
come
i
will
send
thee
into
egypt
7
35
this
moses
whom
they
refused
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
the
same
did
god
send
to
be
a
ruler
and
a
deliverer
by
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
appeared
to
him
in
the
bush
7
36
he
brought
them
out
after
that
he
had
shewed
wonders
and
signs
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
in
the
red
sea
and
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
7
37
this
is
that
moses
which
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
7
38
this
is
he
that
was
in
the
church
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
which
spake
to
him
in
the
mount
sina
and
with
our
fathers
who
received
the
lively
oracles
to
give
unto
us
7
39
to
whom
our
fathers
would
not
obey
but
thrust
him
from
them
and
in
their
hearts
turned
back
again
into
egypt
7
40
saying
unto
aaron
make
us
gods
to
go
before
us
for
as
for
this
moses
which
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him
7
41
and
they
made
a
calf
in
those
days
and
offered
sacrifice
unto
the
idol
and
rejoiced
in
the
works
of
their
own
hands
7
42
then
god
turned
and
gave
them
up
to
worship
the
host
of
heaven
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophets
o
ye
house
of
israel
have
ye
offered
to
me
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
by
the
space
of
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
7
43
yea
ye
took
up
the
tabernacle
of
moloch
and
the
star
of
your
god
remphan
figures
which
ye
made
to
worship
them
and
i
will
carry
you
away
beyond
babylon
7
44
our
fathers
had
the
tabernacle
of
witness
in
the
wilderness
as
he
had
appointed
speaking
unto
moses
that
he
should
make
it
according
to
the
fashion
that
he
had
seen
7
45
which
also
our
fathers
that
came
after
brought
in
with
jesus
into
the
possession
of
the
gentiles
whom
god
drave
out
before
the
face
of
our
fathers
unto
the
days
of
david
7
46
who
found
favour
before
god
and
desired
to
find
a
tabernacle
for
the
god
of
jacob
7
47
but
solomon
built
him
an
house
7
48
howbeit
the
most
high
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
as
saith
the
prophet
7
49
heaven
is
my
throne
and
earth
is
my
footstool
what
house
will
ye
build
me
saith
the
lord
or
what
is
the
place
of
my
rest
7
50
hath
not
my
hand
made
all
these
things
7
51
ye
stiffnecked
and
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
ears
ye
do
always
resist
the
holy
ghost
as
your
fathers
did
so
do
ye
7
52
which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted
and
they
have
slain
them
which
shewed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
just
one
of
whom
ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
murderers
7
53
who
have
received
the
law
by
the
disposition
of
angels
and
have
not
kept
it
7
54
when
they
heard
these
things
they
were
cut
to
the
heart
and
they
gnashed
on
him
with
their
teeth
7
55
but
he
being
full
of
the
holy
ghost
looked
up
stedfastly
into
heaven
and
saw
the
glory
of
god
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
7
56
and
said
behold
i
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
7
57
then
they
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
stopped
their
ears
and
ran
upon
him
with
one
accord
7
58
and
cast
him
out
of
the
city
and
stoned
him
and
the
witnesses
laid
down
their
clothes
at
a
young
man’s
feet
whose
name
was
saul
7
59
and
they
stoned
stephen
calling
upon
god
and
saying
lord
jesus
receive
my
spirit
7
60
and
he
kneeled
down
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
asleep
8
1
and
saul
was
consenting
unto
his
death
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
persecution
against
the
church
which
was
at
jerusalem
and
they
were
all
scattered
abroad
throughout
the
regions
of
judaea
and
samaria
except
the
apostles
8
2
and
devout
men
carried
stephen
to
his
burial
and
made
great
lamentation
over
him
8
3
as
for
saul
he
made
havock
of
the
church
entering
into
every
house
and
haling
men
and
women
committed
them
to
prison
8
4
therefore
they
that
were
scattered
abroad
went
every
where
preaching
the
word
8
5
then
philip
went
down
to
the
city
of
samaria
and
preached
christ
unto
them
8
6
and
the
people
with
one
accord
gave
heed
unto
those
things
which
philip
spake
hearing
and
seeing
the
miracles
which
he
did
8
7
for
unclean
spirits
crying
with
loud
voice
came
out
of
many
that
were
possessed
with
them
and
many
taken
with
palsies
and
that
were
lame
were
healed
8
8
and
there
was
great
joy
in
that
city
8
9
but
there
was
a
certain
man
called
simon
which
beforetime
in
the
same
city
used
sorcery
and
bewitched
the
people
of
samaria
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
one
8
10
to
whom
they
all
gave
heed
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
saying
this
man
is
the
great
power
of
god
8
11
and
to
him
they
had
regard
because
that
of
long
time
he
had
bewitched
them
with
sorceries
8
12
but
when
they
believed
philip
preaching
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
name
of
jesus
christ
they
were
baptized
both
men
and
women
8
13
then
simon
himself
believed
also
and
when
he
was
baptized
he
continued
with
philip
and
wondered
beholding
the
miracles
and
signs
which
were
done
8
14
now
when
the
apostles
which
were
at
jerusalem
heard
that
samaria
had
received
the
word
of
god
they
sent
unto
them
peter
and
john
8
15
who
when
they
were
come
down
prayed
for
them
that
they
might
receive
the
holy
ghost
8
16
(for
as
yet
he
was
fallen
upon
none
of
them
only
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
)
8
17
then
laid
they
their
hands
on
them
and
they
received
the
holy
ghost
8
18
and
when
simon
saw
that
through
laying
on
of
the
apostles’
hands
the
holy
ghost
was
given
he
offered
them
money
8
19
saying
give
me
also
this
power
that
on
whomsoever
i
lay
hands
he
may
receive
the
holy
ghost
8
20
but
peter
said
unto
him
thy
money
perish
with
thee
because
thou
hast
thought
that
the
gift
of
god
may
be
purchased
with
money
8
21
thou
hast
neither
part
nor
lot
in
this
matter
for
thy
heart
is
not
right
in
the
sight
of
god
8
22
repent
therefore
of
this
thy
wickedness
and
pray
god
if
perhaps
the
thought
of
thine
heart
may
be
forgiven
thee
8
23
for
i
perceive
that
thou
art
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
the
bond
of
iniquity
8
24
then
answered
simon
and
said
pray
ye
to
the
lord
for
me
that
none
of
these
things
which
ye
have
spoken
come
upon
me
8
25
and
they
when
they
had
testified
and
preached
the
word
of
the
lord
returned
to
jerusalem
and
preached
the
gospel
in
many
villages
of
the
samaritans
8
26
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
philip
saying
arise
and
go
toward
the
south
unto
the
way
that
goeth
down
from
jerusalem
unto
gaza
which
is
desert
8
27
and
he
arose
and
went
and
behold
a
man
of
ethiopia
an
eunuch
of
great
authority
under
candace
queen
of
the
ethiopians
who
had
the
charge
of
all
her
treasure
and
had
come
to
jerusalem
for
to
worship
8
28
was
returning
and
sitting
in
his
chariot
read
esaias
the
prophet
8
29
then
the
spirit
said
unto
philip
go
near
and
join
thyself
to
this
chariot
8
30
and
philip
ran
thither
to
him
and
heard
him
read
the
prophet
esaias
and
said
understandest
thou
what
thou
readest
8
31
and
he
said
how
can
i
except
some
man
should
guide
me
and
he
desired
philip
that
he
would
come
up
and
sit
with
him
8
32
the
place
of
the
scripture
which
he
read
was
this
he
was
led
as
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
and
like
a
lamb
dumb
before
his
shearer
so
opened
he
not
his
mouth
8
33
in
his
humiliation
his
judgment
was
taken
away
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
his
life
is
taken
from
the
earth
8
34
and
the
eunuch
answered
philip
and
said
i
pray
thee
of
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
this
of
himself
or
of
some
other
man
8
35
then
philip
opened
his
mouth
and
began
at
the
same
scripture
and
preached
unto
him
jesus
8
36
and
as
they
went
on
their
way
they
came
unto
a
certain
water
and
the
eunuch
said
see
here
is
water
what
doth
hinder
me
to
be
baptized
8
37
and
philip
said
if
thou
believest
with
all
thine
heart
thou
mayest
and
he
answered
and
said
i
believe
that
jesus
christ
is
the
son
of
god
8
38
and
he
commanded
the
chariot
to
stand
still
and
they
went
down
both
into
the
water
both
philip
and
the
eunuch
and
he
baptized
him
8
39
and
when
they
were
come
up
out
of
the
water
the
spirit
of
the
lord
caught
away
philip
that
the
eunuch
saw
him
no
more
and
he
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
8
40
but
philip
was
found
at
azotus
and
passing
through
he
preached
in
all
the
cities
till
he
came
to
caesarea
9
1
and
saul
yet
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
against
the
disciples
of
the
lord
went
unto
the
high
priest
9
2
and
desired
of
him
letters
to
damascus
to
the
synagogues
that
if
he
found
any
of
this
way
whether
they
were
men
or
women
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
jerusalem
9
3
and
as
he
journeyed
he
came
near
damascus
and
suddenly
there
shined
round
about
him
a
light
from
heaven
9
4
and
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
him
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
9
5
and
he
said
who
art
thou
lord
and
the
lord
said
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
9
6
and
he
trembling
and
astonished
said
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
and
go
into
the
city
and
it
shall
be
told
thee
what
thou
must
do
9
7
and
the
men
which
journeyed
with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
a
voice
but
seeing
no
man
9
8
and
saul
arose
from
the
earth
and
when
his
eyes
were
opened
he
saw
no
man
but
they
led
him
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
into
damascus
9
9
and
he
was
three
days
without
sight
and
neither
did
eat
nor
drink
9
10
and
there
was
a
certain
disciple
at
damascus
named
ananias
and
to
him
said
the
lord
in
a
vision
ananias
and
he
said
behold
i
am
here
lord
9
11
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
and
go
into
the
street
which
is
called
straight
and
enquire
in
the
house
of
judas
for
one
called
saul
of
tarsus
for
behold
he
prayeth
9
12
and
hath
seen
in
a
vision
a
man
named
ananias
coming
in
and
putting
his
hand
on
him
that
he
might
receive
his
sight
9
13
then
ananias
answered
lord
i
have
heard
by
many
of
this
man
how
much
evil
he
hath
done
to
thy
saints
at
jerusalem
9
14
and
here
he
hath
authority
from
the
chief
priests
to
bind
all
that
call
on
thy
name
9
15
but
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
thy
way
for
he
is
a
chosen
vessel
unto
me
to
bear
my
name
before
the
gentiles
and
kings
and
the
children
of
israel
9
16
for
i
will
shew
him
how
great
things
he
must
suffer
for
my
name’s
sake
9
17
and
ananias
went
his
way
and
entered
into
the
house
and
putting
his
hands
on
him
said
brother
saul
the
lord
even
jesus
that
appeared
unto
thee
in
the
way
as
thou
camest
hath
sent
me
that
thou
mightest
receive
thy
sight
and
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
9
18
and
immediately
there
fell
from
his
eyes
as
it
had
been
scales
and
he
received
sight
forthwith
and
arose
and
was
baptized
9
19
and
when
he
had
received
meat
he
was
strengthened
then
was
saul
certain
days
with
the
disciples
which
were
at
damascus
9
20
and
straightway
he
preached
christ
in
the
synagogues
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
9
21
but
all
that
heard
him
were
amazed
and
said
is
not
this
he
that
destroyed
them
which
called
on
this
name
in
jerusalem
and
came
hither
for
that
intent
that
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
the
chief
priests
9
22
but
saul
increased
the
more
in
strength
and
confounded
the
jews
which
dwelt
at
damascus
proving
that
this
is
very
christ
9
23
and
after
that
many
days
were
fulfilled
the
jews
took
counsel
to
kill
him
9
24
but
their
laying
await
was
known
of
saul
and
they
watched
the
gates
day
and
night
to
kill
him
9
25
then
the
disciples
took
him
by
night
and
let
him
down
by
the
wall
in
a
basket
9
26
and
when
saul
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
assayed
to
join
himself
to
the
disciples
but
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
and
believed
not
that
he
was
a
disciple
9
27
but
barnabas
took
him
and
brought
him
to
the
apostles
and
declared
unto
them
how
he
had
seen
the
lord
in
the
way
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
and
how
he
had
preached
boldly
at
damascus
in
the
name
of
jesus
9
28
and
he
was
with
them
coming
in
and
going
out
at
jerusalem
9
29
and
he
spake
boldly
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
disputed
against
the
grecians
but
they
went
about
to
slay
him
9
30
which
when
the
brethren
knew
they
brought
him
down
to
caesarea
and
sent
him
forth
to
tarsus
9
31
then
had
the
churches
rest
throughout
all
judaea
and
galilee
and
samaria
and
were
edified
and
walking
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
in
the
comfort
of
the
holy
ghost
were
multiplied
9
32
and
it
came
to
pass
as
peter
passed
throughout
all
quarters
he
came
down
also
to
the
saints
which
dwelt
at
lydda
9
33
and
there
he
found
a
certain
man
named
aeneas
which
had
kept
his
bed
eight
years
and
was
sick
of
the
palsy
9
34
and
peter
said
unto
him
aeneas
jesus
christ
maketh
thee
whole
arise
and
make
thy
bed
and
he
arose
immediately
9
35
and
all
that
dwelt
at
lydda
and
saron
saw
him
and
turned
to
the
lord
9
36
now
there
was
at
joppa
a
certain
disciple
named
tabitha
which
by
interpretation
is
called
dorcas
this
woman
was
full
of
good
works
and
almsdeeds
which
she
did
9
37
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
she
was
sick
and
died
whom
when
they
had
washed
they
laid
her
in
an
upper
chamber
9
38
and
forasmuch
as
lydda
was
nigh
to
joppa
and
the
disciples
had
heard
that
peter
was
there
they
sent
unto
him
two
men
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
delay
to
come
to
them
9
39
then
peter
arose
and
went
with
them
when
he
was
come
they
brought
him
into
the
upper
chamber
and
all
the
widows
stood
by
him
weeping
and
shewing
the
coats
and
garments
which
dorcas
made
while
she
was
with
them
9
40
but
peter
put
them
all
forth
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
and
turning
him
to
the
body
said
tabitha
arise
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
peter
she
sat
up
9
41
and
he
gave
her
his
hand
and
lifted
her
up
and
when
he
had
called
the
saints
and
widows
presented
her
alive
9
42
and
it
was
known
throughout
all
joppa
and
many
believed
in
the
lord
9
43
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
tarried
many
days
in
joppa
with
one
simon
a
tanner
10
1
there
was
a
certain
man
in

a
devout
man
and
one
that
feared
god
with
all
his
house
which
gave
much
alms
to
the
people
and
prayed
to
god
alway
10

he
saw
in
a
vision
evidently
about
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day
an
angel
of
god
coming
in
to
him
and
saying
unto
him
cornelius
10
4
and
when
he
looked
on
him
he
was
afraid
and
said
what
is
it
lord
and
he
said
unto
him
thy
prayers
and
thine
alms
are
come
up
for
a
memorial
before

and

tanner
whose
house
is
by
the
sea
side
he
shall
tell
thee
what
thou
oughtest
to
do
10
7
and
when
the
angel
which
spake
unto
cornelius
was
departed
he
called
two
of
his
household
servants
and
a
devout
soldier
of
them
that
waited
on
him
continually
10
8
and
when
he
had
declared
all
these
things
unto
them
he
sent
them
to
joppa
10
9
on
the
morrow
as
they
went
on
their
journey
and
drew
nigh
unto
the
city
peter
went
up
upon
the
housetop
to
pray
about
the
sixth
hour
10
10
and
he
became
very
hungry
and
would
have
eaten
but
while
they
made
ready
he
fell
into
a
trance
10
11
and
saw
heaven
opened
and
a
certain
vessel
descending
upon
him
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
knit
at
the
four
corners
and
let
down
to
the
earth
10
12
wherein
were
all
manner
of
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth
and
wild
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
fowls
of
the
air
10
13
and
there
came
a
voice
to
him
rise
peter
kill
and
eat
10
14
but
peter
said
not
so
lord
for
i
have
never
eaten
any
thing
that
is
common
or
unclean
10
15
and
the
voice
spake
unto
him
again
the
second
time
what
god
hath
cleansed
that
call
not
thou
common
10
16
this
was
done
thrice
and
the
vessel
was
received
up
again
into
heaven
10
17
now
while
peter
doubted
in
himself
what
this
vision
which
he
had
seen
should
mean
behold
the
men
which
were
sent
from
cornelius
had
made
enquiry
for
simon’s
house
and
stood
before
the
gate
10
18
and
called
and
asked
whether
simon
which
was
surnamed
peter
were
lodged
there
10
19
while
peter
thought
on
the
vision
the
spirit
said
unto
him
behold
three
men
seek
thee
10
20
arise
therefore
and
get
thee
down
and
go
with
them
doubting
nothing
for
i
have
sent
them
10
21
then
peter
went
down
to
the
men
which
were
sent
unto
him
from
cornelius
and
said
behold
i
am
he
whom
ye
seek
what
is
the
cause
wherefore
ye
are
come
10
22
and
they
said
cornelius
the
centurion
a
just
man
and
one
that
feareth
god
and
of
good
report
among
all
the
nation
of
the
jews
was
warned
from
god
by
an
holy
angel
to
send
for
thee
into
his
house
and
to
hear
words
of
thee
10
23
then
called
he
them
in
and
lodged
them
and
on
the
morrow
peter
went
away
with
them
and
certain
brethren
from
joppa
accompanied
him
10
24
and
the
morrow
after
they
entered
into
caesarea
and
cornelius
waited
for
them
and
he
had
called
together
his
kinsmen
and
near
friends
10
25
and
as
peter
was
coming
in
cornelius
met
him
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
worshipped
him
10
26
but
peter
took
him
up
saying
stand
up
i
myself
also
am
a
man
10
27
and
as
he
talked
with
him
he
went
in
and
found
many
that
were
come
together
10
28
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
how
that
it
is
an
unlawful
thing
for
a
man
that
is
a
jew
to
keep
company
or
come
unto
one
of
another
nation
but
god
hath
shewed
me
that
i
should
not
call
any
man
common
or
unclean
10
29
therefore
came
i
unto
you
without
gainsaying
as
soon
as
i
was
sent
for
i
ask
therefore
for
what
intent
ye
have
sent
for
me
10
30
and
cornelius
said
four
days
ago
i
was
fasting
until
this
hour
and
at
the
ninth
hour
i
prayed
in
my
house
and
behold
a
man
stood
before
me
in
bright
clothing
10
31
and
said
cornelius
thy
prayer
is
heard
and
thine
alms
are
had
in
remembrance
in
the
sight
of
god
10
32
send
therefore
to
joppa
and
call
hither
simon
whose
surname
is
peter
he
is
lodged
in
the
house
of
one
simon
a
tanner
by
the
sea
side
who
when
he
cometh
shall
speak
unto
thee
10
33
immediately
therefore
i
sent
to
thee
and
thou
hast
well
done
that
thou
art
come
now
therefore
are
we
all
here
present
before
god
to
hear
all
things
that
are
commanded
thee
of
god
10
34
then
peter
opened
his
mouth
and
said
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
10
35
but
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
with
him
10
36
the
word
which
god
sent
unto
the
children
of
israel
preaching
peace
by
jesus
christ
(he
is
lord
of
all
)
10
37
that
word
i
say
ye
know
which
was
published
throughout
all
judaea
and
began
from
galilee
after
the
baptism
which
john
preached
10
38
how
god
anointed
jesus
of
nazareth
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
power
who
went
about
doing
good
and
healing
all
that
were
oppressed
of
the
devil
for
god
was
with
him
10
39
and
we
are
witnesses
of
all
things
which
he
did
both
in
the
land
of
the
jews
and
in
jerusalem
whom
they
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
10
40
him
god
raised
up
the
third
day
and
shewed
him
openly
10
41
not
to
all
the
people
but
unto
witnesses
chosen
before
god
even
to
us
who
did
eat
and
drink
with
him
after
he
rose
from
the
dead
10
42
and
he
commanded
us
to
preach
unto
the
people
and
to
testify
that
it
is
he
which
was
ordained
of
god
to
be
the
judge
of
quick
and
dead
10
43
to
him
give
all
the
prophets
witness
that
through
his
name
whosoever
believeth
in
him
shall
receive
remission
of
sins
10
44
while
peter
yet
spake
these
words
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
word
10
45
and
they
of
the
circumcision
which
believed
were
astonished
as
many
as
came
with
peter
because
that
on
the
gentiles
also
was
poured
out
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
10
46
for
they
heard
them
speak
with
tongues
and
magnify
god
then
answered
peter
10
47
can
any
man
forbid
water
that
these
should
not
be
baptized
which
have
received
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
we
10
48
and
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
then
prayed
they
him
to
tarry
certain
days
11
1
and
the
apostles
and
brethren
that
were
in
judaea
heard
that
the
gentiles
had
also
received
the
word
of
god
11
2
and
when
peter
was
come
up
to
jerusalem
they
that
were
of
the
circumcision
contended
with
him
11
3
saying
thou
wentest
in
to
men
uncircumcised
and
didst
eat
with
them
11
4
but
peter
rehearsed
the
matter
from
the
beginning
and
expounded
it
by
order
unto
them
saying
11
5
i
was
in
the
city
of
joppa
praying
and
in
a
trance
i
saw
a
vision
a
certain
vessel
descend
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
let
down
from
heaven
by
four
corners
and
it
came
even
to
me
11
6
upon
the
which
when
i
had
fastened
mine
eyes
i
considered
and
saw
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth
and
wild
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
fowls
of
the
air
11
7
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me
arise
peter
slay
and
eat
11
8
but
i
said
not
so
lord
for
nothing
common
or
unclean
hath
at
any
time
entered
into
my
mouth
11
9
but
the
voice
answered
me
again
from
heaven
what
god
hath
cleansed
that
call
not
thou
common
11
10
and
this
was
done
three
times
and
all
were
drawn
up
again
into
heaven
11
11
and
behold
immediately
there
were
three
men
already
come
unto
the
house
where
i
was
sent
from
caesarea
unto
me
11
12
and
the
spirit
bade
me
go
with
them
nothing
doubting
moreover
these
six
brethren
accompanied
me
and
we
entered
into
the
man’s
house
11
13
and
he
shewed
us
how
he
had
seen
an
angel
in
his
house
which
stood
and
said
unto
him
send
men
to
joppa
and
call
for
simon
whose
surname
is
peter
11
14
who
shall
tell
thee
words
whereby
thou
and
all
thy
house
shall
be
saved
11
15
and
as
i
began
to
speak
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
them
as
on
us
at
the
beginning
11
16
then
remembered
i
the
word
of
the
lord
how
that
he
said
john
indeed
baptized
with
water
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
11
17
forasmuch
then
as
god
gave
them
the
like
gift
as
he
did
unto
us
who
believed
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
what
was
i
that
i
could
withstand
god
11
18
when
they
heard
these
things
they
held
their
peace
and
glorified
god
saying
then
hath
god
also
to
the
gentiles
granted
repentance
unto
life
11
19
now
they
which
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
persecution
that
arose
about
stephen
travelled
as
far
as
phenice
and
cyprus
and
antioch
preaching
the
word
to
none
but
unto
the
jews
only
11
20
and
some
of
them
were
men
of
cyprus
and
cyrene
which
when
they
were
come
to
antioch
spake
unto
the
grecians
preaching
the
lord
jesus
11
21
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
with
them
and
a
great
number
believed
and
turned
unto
the
lord
11
22
then
tidings
of
these
things
came
unto
the
ears
of
the
church
which
was
in
jerusalem
and
they
sent
forth
barnabas
that
he
should
go
as
far
as
antioch
11
23
who
when
he
came
and
had
seen
the
grace
of
god
was
glad
and
exhorted
them
all
that
with
purpose
of
heart
they
would
cleave
unto
the
lord
11
24
for
he
was
a
good
man
and
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
faith
and
much
people
was
added
unto
the
lord
11
25
then
departed
barnabas
to
tarsus
for
to
seek
saul
11
26
and
when
he
had
found
him
he
brought
him
unto
antioch
and
it
came
to
pass
that
a
whole
year
they
assembled
themselves
with
the
church
and
taught
much
people
and
the
disciples
were
called
christians
first
in
antioch
11
27
and
in
these
days
came
prophets
from
jerusalem
unto
antioch
11
28
and
there
stood
up
one
of
them
named
agabus
and
signified
by
the
spirit
that
there
should
be
great
dearth
throughout
all
the
world
which
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
claudius
caesar
11
29
then
the
disciples
every
man
according
to
his
ability
determined
to
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
which
dwelt
in
judaea
11
30
which
also
they
did
and
sent
it
to
the
elders
by
the
hands
of
barnabas
and
saul
12
1
now
about
that
time
herod
the
king
stretched
forth
his
hands
to
vex
certain
of
the
church
12
2
and
he
killed
james
the
brother
of
john
with
the
sword
12
3
and
because
he
saw
it
pleased
the
jews
he
proceeded
further
to
take
peter
also
(then
were
the
days
of
unleavened
bread
)
12
4
and
when
he
had
apprehended
him
he
put
him
in
prison
and
delivered
him
to
four
quaternions
of
soldiers
to
keep
him
intending
after
easter
to
bring
him
forth
to
the
people
12
5
peter
therefore
was
kept
in
prison
but
prayer
was
made
without
ceasing
of
the
church
unto
god
for
him
12
6
and
when
herod
would
have
brought
him
forth
the
same
night
peter
was
sleeping
between
two
soldiers
bound
with
two
chains
and
the
keepers
before
the
door
kept
the
prison
12
7
and
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
a
light
shined
in
the
prison
and
he
smote
peter
on
the
side
and
raised
him
up
saying
arise
up
quickly
and
his
chains
fell
off
from
his
hands
12
8
and
the
angel
said
unto
him
gird
thyself
and
bind
on
thy
sandals
and
so
he
did
and
he
saith
unto
him
cast
thy
garment
about
thee
and
follow
me
12
9
and
he
went
out
and
followed
him
and
wist
not
that
it
was
true
which
was
done
by
the
angel
but
thought
he
saw
a
vision
12
10
when
they
were
past
the
first
and
the
second
ward
they
came
unto
the
iron
gate
that
leadeth
unto
the
city
which
opened
to
them
of
his
own
accord
and
they
went
out
and
passed
on
through
one
street
and
forthwith
the
angel
departed
from
him
12
11
and
when
peter
was
come
to
himself
he
said
now
i
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
sent
his
angel
and
hath
delivered
me
out
of
the
hand
of
herod
and
from
all
the
expectation
of
the
people
of
the
jews
12
12
and
when
he
had
considered
the
thing
he
came
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
john
whose
surname
was
mark
where
many
were
gathered
together
praying
12
13
and
as
peter
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
gate
a
damsel
came
to
hearken
named
rhoda
12
14
and
when
she
knew
peter’s
voice
she
opened
not
the
gate
for
gladness
but
ran
in
and
told
how
peter
stood
before
the
gate
12
15
and
they
said
unto
her
thou
art
mad
but
she
constantly
affirmed
that
it
was
even
so
then
said
they
it
is
his
angel
12
16
but
peter
continued
knocking
and
when
they
had
opened
the
door
and
saw
him
they
were
astonished
12
17
but
he
beckoning
unto
them
with
the
hand
to
hold
their
peace
declared
unto
them
how
the
lord
had
brought
him
out
of
the
prison
and
he
said
go
shew
these
things
unto
james
and
to
the
brethren
and
he
departed
and
went
into
another
place
12
18
now
as
soon
as
it
was
day
there
was
no
small
stir
among
the
soldiers
what
was
become
of
peter
12
19
and
when
herod
had
sought
for
him
and
found
him
not
he
examined
the
keepers
and
commanded
that
they
should
be
put
to
death
and
he
went
down
from
judaea
to
caesarea
and
there
abode
12
20
and
herod
was
highly
displeased
with
them
of
tyre
and
sidon
but
they
came
with
one
accord
to
him
and
having
made
blastus
the
king’s
chamberlain
their
friend
desired
peace
because
their
country
was
nourished
by
the
king’s
country
12
21
and
upon
a
set
day
herod
arrayed
in
royal
apparel
sat
upon
his
throne
and
made
an
oration
unto
them
12
22
and
the
people
gave
a
shout
saying
it
is
the
voice
of
a
god
and
not
of
a
man
12
23
and
immediately
the
angel
of
the
lord
smote
him
because
he
gave
not
god
the
glory
and
he
was
eaten
of
worms
and
gave
up
the
ghost
12
24
but
the
word
of
god
grew
and
multiplied
12
25
and
barnabas
and
saul
returned
from
jerusalem
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
ministry
and
took
with
them
john
whose
surname
was
mark
13
1
now
there
were
in
the
church
that
was
at
antioch
certain
prophets
and
teachers
as
barnabas
and
simeon
that
was
called
niger
and
lucius
of
cyrene
and
manaen
which
had
been
brought
up
with
herod
the
tetrarch
and
saul
13
2
as
they
ministered
to
the
lord
and
fasted
the
holy
ghost
said
separate
me
barnabas
and
saul
for
the
work
whereunto
i
have
called
them
13
3
and
when
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
laid
their
hands
on
them
they
sent
them
away
13
4
so
they
being
sent
forth
by
the
holy
ghost
departed
unto
seleucia
and
from
thence
they
sailed
to
cyprus
13
5
and
when
they
were
at
salamis
they
preached
the
word
of
god
in
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
and
they
had
also
john
to
their
minister
13
6
and
when
they
had
gone
through
the
isle
unto
paphos
they
found
a
certain
sorcerer
a
false
prophet
a
jew
whose
name
was
barjesus
13
7
which
was
with
the
deputy
of
the
country
sergius
paulus
a
prudent
man
who
called
for
barnabas
and
saul
and
desired
to
hear
the
word
of
god
13
8
but
elymas
the
sorcerer
(for
so
is
his
name
by
interpretation)
withstood
them
seeking
to
turn
away
the
deputy
from
the
faith
13
9
then
saul
(who
also
is
called
paul
)
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
set
his
eyes
on
him
13
10
and
said
o
full
of
all
subtilty
and
all
mischief
thou
child
of
the
devil
thou
enemy
of
all
righteousness
wilt
thou
not
cease
to
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
13
11
and
now
behold
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
blind
not
seeing
the
sun
for
a
season
and
immediately
there
fell
on
him
a
mist
and
a
darkness
and
he
went
about
seeking
some
to
lead
him
by
the
hand
13
12
then
the
deputy
when
he
saw
what
was
done
believed
being
astonished
at
the
doctrine
of
the
lord
13
13
now
when
paul
and
his
company
loosed
from
paphos
they
came
to
perga
in
pamphylia
and
john
departing
from
them
returned
to
jerusalem
13
14
but
when
they
departed
from
perga
they
came
to
antioch
in
pisidia
and
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day
and
sat
down
13
15
and
after
the
reading
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue
sent
unto
them
saying
ye
men
and
brethren
if
ye
have
any
word
of
exhortation
for
the
people
say
on
13
16
then
paul
stood
up
and
beckoning
with
his
hand
said
men
of
israel
and
ye
that
fear
god
give
audience
13
17
the
god
of
this
people
of
israel
chose
our
fathers
and
exalted
the
people
when
they
dwelt
as
strangers
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
with
an
high
arm
brought
he
them
out
of
it
13
18
and
about
the
time
of
forty
years
suffered
he
their
manners
in
the
wilderness
13
19
and
when
he
had
destroyed
seven
nations
in
the
land
of
chanaan
he
divided
their
land
to
them
by
lot
13
20
and
after
that
he
gave
unto
them
judges
about
the
space
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
until
samuel
the
prophet
13
21
and
afterward
they
desired
a
king
and
god
gave
unto
them
saul
the
son
of
cis
a
man
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
by
the
space
of
forty
years
13
22
and
when
he
had
removed
him
he
raised
up
unto
them
david
to
be
their
king
to
whom
also
he
gave
their
testimony
and
said
i
have
found
david
the
son
of
jesse
a
man
after
mine
own
heart
which
shall
fulfil
all
my
will
13
23
of
this
man’s
seed
hath
god
according
to
his
promise
raised
unto
israel
a
saviour
jesus
13
24
when
john
had
first
preached
before
his
coming
the
baptism
of
repentance
to
all
the
people
of
israel
13
25
and
as
john
fulfilled
his
course
he
said
whom
think
ye
that
i
am
i
am
not
he
but
behold
there
cometh
one
after
me
whose
shoes
of
his
feet
i
am
not
worthy
to
loose
13
26
men
and
brethren
children
of
the
stock
of
abraham
and
whosoever
among
you
feareth
god
to
you
is
the
word
of
this
salvation
sent
13
27
for
they
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
and
their
rulers
because
they
knew
him
not
nor
yet
the
voices
of
the
prophets
which
are
read
every
sabbath
day
they
have
fulfilled
them
in
condemning
him
13
28
and
though
they
found
no
cause
of
death
in
him
yet
desired
they
pilate
that
he
should
be
slain
13
29
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
all
that
was
written
of
him
they
took
him
down
from
the
tree
and
laid
him
in
a
sepulchre
13
30
but
god
raised
him
from
the
dead
13
31
and
he
was
seen
many
days
of
them
which
came
up
with
him
from
galilee
to
jerusalem
who
are
his
witnesses
unto
the
people
13
32
and
we
declare
unto
you
glad
tidings
how
that
the
promise
which
was
made
unto
the
fathers
13
33
god
hath
fulfilled
the
same
unto
us
their
children
in
that
he
hath
raised
up
jesus
again
as
it
is
also
written
in
the
second
psalm
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
13
34
and
as
concerning
that
he
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
now
no
more
to
return
to
corruption
he
said
on
this
wise
i
will
give
you
the
sure
mercies
of
david
13
35
wherefore
he
saith
also
in
another
psalm
thou
shalt
not
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
13
36
for
david
after
he
had
served
his
own
generation
by
the
will
of
god
fell
on
sleep
and
was
laid
unto
his
fathers
and
saw
corruption
13
37
but
he
whom
god
raised
again
saw
no
corruption
13
38
be
it
known
unto
you
therefore
men
and
brethren
that
through
this
man
is
preached
unto
you
the
forgiveness
of
sins
13
39
and
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
moses
13
40
beware
therefore
lest
that
come
upon
you
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
prophets
13
41
behold
ye
despisers
and
wonder
and
perish
for
i
work
a
work
in
your
days
a
work
which
ye
shall
in
no
wise
believe
though
a
man
declare
it
unto
you
13
42
and
when
the
jews
were
gone
out
of
the
synagogue
the
gentiles
besought
that
these
words
might
be
preached
to
them
the
next
sabbath
13
43
now
when
the
congregation
was
broken
up
many
of
the
jews
and
religious
proselytes
followed
paul
and
barnabas
who
speaking
to
them
persuaded
them
to
continue
in
the
grace
of
god
13
44
and
the
next
sabbath
day
came
almost
the
whole
city
together
to
hear
the
word
of
god
13
45
but
when
the
jews
saw
the
multitudes
they
were
filled
with
envy
and
spake
against
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
paul
contradicting
and
blaspheming
13
46
then
paul
and
barnabas
waxed
bold
and
said
it
was
necessary
that
the
word
of
god
should
first
have
been
spoken
to
you
but
seeing
ye
put
it
from
you
and
judge
yourselves
unworthy
of
everlasting
life
lo
we
turn
to
the
gentiles
13
47
for
so
hath
the
lord
commanded
us
saying
i
have
set
thee
to
be
a
light
of
the
gentiles
that
thou
shouldest
be
for
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
13
48
and
when
the
gentiles
heard
this
they
were
glad
and
glorified
the
word
of
the
lord
and
as
many
as
were
ordained
to
eternal
life
believed
13
49
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
published
throughout
all
the
region
13
50
but
the
jews
stirred
up
the
devout
and
honourable
women
and
the
chief
men
of
the
city
and
raised
persecution
against
paul
and
barnabas
and
expelled
them
out
of
their
coasts
13
51
but
they
shook
off
the
dust
of
their
feet
against
them
and
came
unto
iconium
13
52
and
the
disciples
were
filled
with
joy
and
with
the
holy
ghost
14
1
and
it
came
to
pass
in
iconium
that
they
went
both
together
into
the
synagogue
of
the
jews
and
so
spake
that
a
great
multitude
both
of
the
jews
and
also
of
the
greeks
believed
14
2
but
the
unbelieving
jews
stirred
up
the
gentiles
and
made
their
minds
evil
affected
against
the
brethren
14
3
long
time
therefore
abode
they
speaking
boldly
in
the
lord
which
gave
testimony
unto
the
word
of
his
grace
and
granted
signs
and
wonders
to
be
done
by
their
hands
14
4
but
the
multitude
of
the
city
was
divided
and
part
held
with
the
jews
and
part
with
the
apostles
14
5
and
when
there
was
an
assault
made
both
of
the
gentiles
and
also
of
the
jews
with
their
rulers
to
use
them
despitefully
and
to
stone
them
14
6
they
were
ware
of
it
and
fled
unto
lystra
and
derbe
cities
of
lycaonia
and
unto
the
region
that
lieth
round
about
14
7
and
there
they
preached
the
gospel
14
8
and
there
sat
a
certain
man
at
lystra
impotent
in
his
feet
being
a
cripple
from
his
mother’s
womb
who
never
had
walked
14
9
the
same
heard
paul
speak
who
stedfastly
beholding
him
and
perceiving
that
he
had
faith
to
be
healed
14
10
said
with
a
loud
voice
stand
upright
on
thy
feet
and
he
leaped
and
walked
14
11
and
when
the
people
saw
what
paul
had
done
they
lifted
up
their
voices
saying
in
the
speech
of
lycaonia
the
gods
are
come
down
to
us
in
the
likeness
of
men
14
12
and
they
called
barnabas
jupiter
and
paul
mercurius
because
he
was
the
chief
speaker
14
13
then
the
priest
of
jupiter
which
was
before
their
city
brought
oxen
and
garlands
unto
the
gates
and
would
have
done
sacrifice
with
the
people
14
14
which
when
the
apostles
barnabas
and
paul
heard
of
they
rent
their
clothes
and
ran
in
among
the
people
crying
out
14
15
and
saying
sirs
why
do
ye
these
things
we
also
are
men
of
like
passions
with
you
and
preach
unto
you
that
ye
should
turn
from
these
vanities
unto
the
living
god
which
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
things
that
are
therein
14
16
who
in
times
past
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
ways
14
17
nevertheless
he
left
not
himself
without
witness
in
that
he
did
good
and
gave
us
rain
from
heaven
and
fruitful
seasons
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
gladness
14
18
and
with
these
sayings
scarce
restrained
they
the
people
that
they
had
not
done
sacrifice
unto
them
14
19
and
there
came
thither
certain
jews
from
antioch
and
iconium
who
persuaded
the
people
and
having
stoned
paul
drew
him
out
of
the
city
supposing
he
had
been
dead
14
20
howbeit
as
the
disciples
stood
round
about
him
he
rose
up
and
came
into
the
city
and
the
next
day
he
departed
with
barnabas
to
derbe
14
21
and
when
they
had
preached
the
gospel
to
that
city
and
had
taught
many
they
returned
again
to
lystra
and
to
iconium
and
antioch
14
22
confirming
the
souls
of
the
disciples
and
exhorting
them
to
continue
in
the
faith
and
that
we
must
through
much
tribulation
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
14
23
and
when
they
had
ordained
them
elders
in
every
church
and
had
prayed
with
fasting
they
commended
them
to
the
lord
on
whom
they
believed
14
24
and
after
they
had
passed
throughout
pisidia
they
came
to
pamphylia
14
25
and
when
they
had
preached
the
word
in
perga
they
went
down
into
attalia
14
26
and
thence
sailed
to
antioch
from
whence
they
had
been
recommended
to
the
grace
of
god
for
the
work
which
they
fulfilled
14
27
and
when
they
were
come
and
had
gathered
the
church
together
they
rehearsed
all
that
god
had
done
with
them
and
how
he
had
opened
the
door
of
faith
unto
the
gentiles
14
28
and
there
they
abode
long
time
with
the
disciples
15
1
and
certain
men
which
came
down
from
judaea
taught
the
brethren
and
said
except
ye
be
circumcised
after
the
manner
of
moses
ye
cannot
be
saved
15
2
when
therefore
paul
and
barnabas
had
no
small
dissension
and
disputation
with
them
they
determined
that
paul
and
barnabas
and
certain
other
of
them
should
go
up
to
jerusalem
unto
the
apostles
and
elders
about
this
question
15
3
and
being
brought
on
their
way
by
the
church
they
passed
through
phenice
and
samaria
declaring
the
conversion
of
the
gentiles
and
they
caused
great
joy
unto
all
the
brethren
15
4
and
when
they
were
come
to
jerusalem
they
were
received
of
the
church
and
of
the
apostles
and
elders
and
they
declared
all
things
that
god
had
done
with
them
15
5
but
there
rose
up
certain
of
the
sect
of
the
pharisees
which
believed
saying
that
it
was
needful
to
circumcise
them
and
to
command
them
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
15
6
and
the
apostles
and
elders
came
together
for
to
consider
of
this
matter
15
7
and
when
there
had
been
much
disputing
peter
rose
up
and
said
unto
them
men
and
brethren
ye
know
how
that
a
good
while
ago
god
made
choice
among
us
that
the
gentiles
by
my
mouth
should
hear
the
word
of
the
gospel
and
believe
15
8
and
god
which
knoweth
the
hearts
bare
them
witness
giving
them
the
holy
ghost
even
as
he
did
unto
us
15
9
and
put
no
difference
between
us
and
them
purifying
their
hearts
by
faith
15
10
now
therefore
why
tempt
ye
god
to
put
a
yoke
upon
the
neck
of
the
disciples
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
bear
15
11
but
we
believe
that
through
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
we
shall
be
saved
even
as
they
15
12
then
all
the
multitude
kept
silence
and
gave
audience
to
barnabas
and
paul
declaring
what
miracles
and
wonders
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
them
15
13
and
after
they
had
held
their
peace
james
answered
saying
men
and
brethren
hearken
unto
me
15
14
simeon
hath
declared
how
god
at
the
first
did
visit
the
gentiles
to
take
out
of
them
a
people
for
his
name
15
15
and
to
this
agree
the
words
of
the
prophets
as
it
is
written
15
16
after
this
i
will
return
and
will
build
again
the
tabernacle
of
david
which
is
fallen
down
and
i
will
build
again
the
ruins
thereof
and
i
will
set
it
up
15
17
that
the
residue
of
men
might
seek
after
the
lord
and
all
the
gentiles
upon
whom
my
name
is
called
saith
the
lord
who
doeth
all
these
things
15
18
known
unto
god
are
all
his
works
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
15
19
wherefore
my
sentence
is
that
we
trouble
not
them
which
from
among
the
gentiles
are
turned
to
god
15
20
but
that
we
write
unto
them
that
they
abstain
from
pollutions
of
idols
and
from
fornication
and
from
things
strangled
and
from
blood
15
21
for
moses
of
old
time
hath
in
every
city
them
that
preach
him
being
read
in
the
synagogues
every
sabbath
day
15
22
then
pleased
it
the
apostles
and
elders
with
the
whole
church
to
send
chosen
men
of
their
own
company
to
antioch
with
paul
and
barnabas
namely
judas
surnamed
barsabas
and
silas
chief
men
among
the
brethren
15
23
and
they
wrote
letters
by
them
after
this
manner
the
apostles
and
elders
and
brethren
send
greeting
unto
the
brethren
which
are
of
the
gentiles
in
antioch
and
syria
and
cilicia
15
24
forasmuch
as
we
have
heard
that
certain
which
went
out
from
us
have
troubled
you
with
words
subverting
your
souls
saying
ye
must
be
circumcised
and
keep
the
law
to
whom
we
gave
no
such
commandment
15
25
it
seemed
good
unto
us
being
assembled
with
one
accord
to
send
chosen
men
unto
you
with
our
beloved
barnabas
and
paul
15
26
men
that
have
hazarded
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
15
27
we
have
sent
therefore
judas
and
silas
who
shall
also
tell
you
the
same
things
by
mouth
15
28
for
it
seemed
good
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
us
to
lay
upon
you
no
greater
burden
than
these
necessary
things
15
29
that
ye
abstain
from
meats
offered
to
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
things
strangled
and
from
fornication
from
which
if
ye
keep
yourselves
ye
shall
do
well
fare
ye
well
15
30
so
when
they
were
dismissed
they
came
to
antioch
and
when
they
had
gathered
the
multitude
together
they
delivered
the
epistle
15
31
which
when
they
had
read
they
rejoiced
for
the
consolation
15
32
and
judas
and
silas
being
prophets
also
themselves
exhorted
the
brethren
with
many
words
and
confirmed
them
15
33
and
after
they
had
tarried
there
a
space
they
were
let
go
in
peace
from
the
brethren
unto
the
apostles
15
34
notwithstanding
it
pleased
silas
to
abide
there
still
15
35
paul
also
and
barnabas
continued
in
antioch
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
of
the
lord
with
many
others
also
15
36
and
some
days
after
paul
said
unto
barnabas
let
us
go
again
and
visit
our
brethren
in
every
city
where
we
have
preached
the
word
of
the
lord
and
see
how
they
do
15
37
and
barnabas
determined
to
take
with
them
john
whose
surname
was
mark
15
38
but
paul
thought
not
good
to
take
him
with
them
who
departed
from
them
from
pamphylia
and
went
not
with
them
to
the
work
15
39
and
the
contention
was
so
sharp
between
them
that
they
departed
asunder
one
from
the
other
and
so
barnabas
took
mark
and
sailed
unto
cyprus
15
40
and
paul
chose
silas
and
departed
being
recommended
by
the
brethren
unto
the
grace
of
god
15
41
and
he
went
through
syria
and
cilicia
confirming
the
churches
16
1
then
came
he
to
derbe
and
lystra
and
behold
a
certain
disciple
was
there
named
timotheus
the
son
of
a
certain
woman
which
was
a
jewess
and
believed
but
his
father
was
a
greek
16
2
which
was
well
reported
of
by
the
brethren
that
were
at
lystra
and
iconium
16
3
him
would
paul
have
to
go
forth
with
him
and
took
and
circumcised
him
because
of
the
jews
which
were
in
those
quarters
for
they
knew
all
that
his
father
was
a
greek
16
4
and
as
they
went
through
the
cities
they
delivered
them
the
decrees
for
to
keep
that
were
ordained
of
the
apostles
and
elders
which
were
at
jerusalem
16
5
and
so
were
the
churches
established
in
the
faith
and
increased
in
number
daily
16
6
now
when
they
had
gone
throughout
phrygia
and
the
region
of
galatia
and
were
forbidden
of
the
holy
ghost
to
preach
the
word
in
asia
16
7
after
they
were
come
to
mysia
they
assayed
to
go
into
bithynia
but
the
spirit
suffered
them
not
16
8
and
they
passing
by
mysia
came
down
to
troas
16
9
and
a
vision
appeared
to
paul
in
the
night
there
stood
a
man
of
macedonia
and
prayed
him
saying
come
over
into
macedonia
and
help
us
16
10
and
after
he
had
seen
the
vision
immediately
we
endeavoured
to
go
into
macedonia
assuredly
gathering
that
the
lord
had
called
us
for
to
preach
the
gospel
unto
them
16
11
therefore
loosing
from
troas
we
came
with
a
straight
course
to
samothracia
and
the
next
day
to
neapolis
16
12
and
from
thence
to
philippi
which
is
the
chief
city
of
that
part
of
macedonia
and
a
colony
and
we
were
in
that
city
abiding
certain
days
16
13
and
on
the
sabbath
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
a
river
side
where
prayer
was
wont
to
be
made
and
we
sat
down
and
spake
unto
the
women
which
resorted
thither
16
14
and
a
certain
woman
named
lydia
a
seller
of
purple
of
the
city
of
thyatira
which
worshipped
god
heard
us
whose
heart
the
lord
opened
that
she
attended
unto
the
things
which
were
spoken
of
paul
16
15
and
when
she
was
baptized
and
her
household
she
besought
us
saying
if
ye
have
judged
me
to
be
faithful
to
the
lord
come
into
my
house
and
abide
there
and
she
constrained
us
16
16
and
it
came
to
pass
as
we
went
to
prayer
a
certain
damsel
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
divination
met
us
which
brought
her
masters
much
gain
by
soothsaying
16
17
the
same
followed
paul
and
us
and
cried
saying
these
men
are
the
servants
of
the
most
high
god
which
shew
unto
us
the
way
of
salvation
16
18
and
this
did
she
many
days
but
paul
being
grieved
turned
and
said
to
the
spirit
i
command
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
come
out
of
her
and
he
came
out
the
same
hour
16
19
and
when
her
masters
saw
that
the
hope
of
their
gains
was
gone
they
caught
paul
and
silas
and
drew
them
into
the
marketplace
unto
the
rulers
16
20
and
brought
them
to
the
magistrates
saying
these
men
being
jews
do
exceedingly
trouble
our
city
16
21
and
teach
customs
which
are
not
lawful
for
us
to
receive
neither
to
observe
being
romans
16
22
and
the
multitude
rose
up
together
against
them
and
the
magistrates
rent
off
their
clothes
and
commanded
to
beat
them
16
23
and
when
they
had
laid
many
stripes
upon
them
they
cast
them
into
prison
charging
the
jailor
to
keep
them
safely
16
24
who
having
received
such
a
charge
thrust
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
made
their
feet
fast
in
the
stocks
16
25
and
at
midnight
paul
and
silas
prayed
and
sang
praises
unto
god
and
the
prisoners
heard
them
16
26
and
suddenly
there
was
a
great
earthquake
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken
and
immediately
all
the
doors
were
opened
and
every
one’s
bands
were
loosed
16
27
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
awaking
out
of
his
sleep
and
seeing
the
prison
doors
open
he
drew
out
his
sword
and
would
have
killed
himself
supposing
that
the
prisoners
had
been
fled
16
28
but
paul
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
do
thyself
no
harm
for
we
are
all
here
16
29
then
he
called
for
a
light
and
sprang
in
and
came
trembling
and
fell
down
before
paul
and
silas
16
30
and
brought
them
out
and
said
sirs
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
16
31
and
they
said
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
thou
shalt
be
saved
and
thy
house
16
32
and
they
spake
unto
him
the
word
of
the
lord
and
to
all
that
were
in
his
house
16
33
and
he
took
them
the
same
hour
of
the
night
and
washed
their
stripes
and
was
baptized
he
and
all
his
straightway
16
34
and
when
he
had
brought
them
into
his
house
he
set
meat
before
them
and
rejoiced
believing
in
god
with
all
his
house
16
35
and
when
it
was
day
the
magistrates
sent
the
serjeants
saying
let
those
men
go
16
36
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
told
this
saying
to
paul
the
magistrates
have
sent
to
let
you
go
now
therefore
depart
and
go
in
peace
16
37
but
paul
said
unto
them
they
have
beaten
us
openly
uncondemned
being
romans
and
have
cast
us
into
prison
and
now
do
they
thrust
us
out
privily
nay
verily
but
let
them
come
themselves
and
fetch
us
out
16
38
and
the
serjeants
told
these
words
unto
the
magistrates
and
they
feared
when
they
heard
that
they
were
romans
16
39
and
they
came
and
besought
them
and
brought
them
out
and
desired
them
to
depart
out
of
the
city
16
40
and
they
went
out
of
the
prison
and
entered
into
the
house
of
lydia
and
when
they
had
seen
the
brethren
they
comforted
them
and
departed
17
1
now
when
they
had
passed
through
amphipolis
and
apollonia
they
came
to
thessalonica
where
was
a
synagogue
of
the
jews
17
2
and
paul
as
his
manner
was
went
in
unto
them
and
three
sabbath
days
reasoned
with
them
out
of
the
scriptures
17
3
opening
and
alleging
that
christ
must
needs
have
suffered
and
risen
again
from
the
dead
and
that
this
jesus
whom
i
preach
unto
you
is
christ
17
4
and
some
of
them
believed
and
consorted
with
paul
and
silas
and
of
the
devout
greeks
a
great
multitude
and
of
the
chief
women
not
a
few
17
5
but
the
jews
which
believed
not
moved
with
envy
took
unto
them
certain
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
and
gathered
a
company
and
set
all
the
city
on
an
uproar
and
assaulted
the
house
of
jason
and
sought
to
bring
them
out
to
the
people
17
6
and
when
they
found
them
not
they
drew
jason
and
certain
brethren
unto
the
rulers
of
the
city
crying
these
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
also
17
7
whom
jason
hath
received
and
these
all
do
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
caesar
saying
that
there
is
another
king
one
jesus
17
8
and
they
troubled
the
people
and
the
rulers
of
the
city
when
they
heard
these
things
17
9
and
when
they
had
taken
security
of
jason
and
of
the
other
they
let
them
go
17
10
and
the
brethren
immediately
sent
away
paul
and
silas
by
night
unto
berea
who
coming
thither
went
into
the
synagogue
of
the
jews
17
11
these
were
more
noble
than
those
in
thessalonica
in
that
they
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
of
mind
and
searched
the
scriptures
daily
whether
those
things
were
so
17
12
therefore
many
of
them
believed
also
of
honourable
women
which
were
greeks
and
of
men
not
a
few
17
13
but
when
the
jews
of
thessalonica
had
knowledge
that
the
word
of
god
was
preached
of
paul
at
berea
they
came
thither
also
and
stirred
up
the
people
17
14
and
then
immediately
the
brethren
sent
away
paul
to
go
as
it
were
to
the
sea
but
silas
and
timotheus
abode
there
still
17
15
and
they
that
conducted
paul
brought
him
unto
athens
and
receiving
a
commandment
unto
silas
and
timotheus
for
to
come
to
him
with
all
speed
they
departed
17
16
now
while
paul
waited
for
them
at
athens
his
spirit
was
stirred
in
him
when
he
saw
the
city
wholly
given
to
idolatry
17
17
therefore
disputed
he
in
the
synagogue
with
the
jews
and
with
the
devout
persons
and
in
the
market
daily
with
them
that
met
with
him
17
18
then
certain
philosophers
of
the
epicureans
and
of
the
stoicks
encountered
him
and
some
said
what
will
this
babbler
say
other
some
he
seemeth
to
be
a
setter
forth
of
strange
gods
because
he
preached
unto
them
jesus
and
the
resurrection
17
19
and
they
took
him
and
brought
him
unto
areopagus
saying
may
we
know
what
this
new
doctrine
whereof
thou
speakest
is
17
20
for
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
to
our
ears
we
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
mean
17
21
(for
all
the
athenians
and
strangers
which
were
there
spent
their
time
in
nothing
else
but
either
to
tell
or
to
hear
some
new
thing
)
17
22
then
paul
stood
in
the
midst
of
mars’
hill
and
said
ye
men
of
athens
i
perceive
that
in
all
things
ye
are
too
superstitious
17
23
for
as
i
passed
by
and
beheld
your
devotions
i
found
an
altar
with
this
inscription
to
the
unknown
god
whom
therefore
ye
ignorantly
worship
him
declare
i
unto
you
17
24
god
that
made
the
world
and
all
things
therein
seeing
that
he
is
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
17
25
neither
is
worshipped
with
men’s
hands
as
though
he
needed
any
thing
seeing
he
giveth
to
all
life
and
breath
and
all
things
17
26
and
hath
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
hath
determined
the
times
before
appointed
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation
17
27
that
they
should
seek
the
lord
if
haply
they
might
feel
after
him
and
find
him
though
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
17
28
for
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
as
certain
also
of
your
own
poets
have
said
for
we
are
also
his
offspring
17
29
forasmuch
then
as
we
are
the
offspring
of
god
we
ought
not
to
think
that
the
godhead
is
like
unto
gold
or
silver
or
stone
graven
by
art
and
man’s
device
17
30
and
the
times
of
this
ignorance
god
winked
at
but
now
commandeth
all
men
every
where
to
repent
17
31
because
he
hath
appointed
a
day
in
the
which
he
will
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
that
man
whom
he
hath
ordained
whereof
he
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
men
in
that
he
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
17
32
and
when
they
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
some
mocked
and
others
said
we
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
matter
17
33
so
paul
departed
from
among
them
17
34
howbeit
certain
men
clave
unto
him
and
believed
among
the
which
was
dionysius
the
areopagite
and
a
woman
named
damaris
and
others
with
them
18
1
after
these
things
paul
departed
from
athens
and
came
to
corinth
18
2
and
found
a
certain
jew
named
aquila
born
in
pontus
lately
come
from
italy
with
his
wife
priscilla
(because
that
claudius
had
commanded
all
jews
to
depart
from
rome
)
and
came
unto
them
18
3
and
because
he
was
of
the
same
craft
he
abode
with
them
and
wrought
for
by
their
occupation
they
were
tentmakers
18
4
and
he
reasoned
in
the
synagogue
every
sabbath
and
persuaded
the
jews
and
the
greeks
18
5
and
when
silas
and
timotheus
were
come
from
macedonia
paul
was
pressed
in
the
spirit
and
testified
to
the
jews
that
jesus
was
christ
18
6
and
when
they
opposed
themselves
and
blasphemed
he
shook
his
raiment
and
said
unto
them
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
heads
i
am
clean
from
henceforth
i
will
go
unto
the
gentiles
18
7
and
he
departed
thence
and
entered
into
a
certain
man’s
house
named
justus
one
that
worshipped
god
whose
house
joined
hard
to
the
synagogue
18
8
and
crispus
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue
believed
on
the
lord
with
all
his
house
and
many
of
the
corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were
baptized
18
9
then
spake
the
lord
to
paul
in
the
night
by
a
vision
be
not
afraid
but
speak
and
hold
not
thy
peace
18
10
for
i
am
with
thee
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
thee
for
i
have
much
people
in
this
city
18
11
and
he
continued
there
a
year
and
six
months
teaching
the
word
of
god
among
them
18
12
and
when
gallio
was
the
deputy
of
achaia
the
jews
made
insurrection
with
one
accord
against
paul
and
brought
him
to
the
judgment
seat
18
13
saying
this
fellow
persuadeth
men
to
worship
god
contrary
to
the
law
18
14
and
when
paul
was
now
about
to
open
his
mouth
gallio
said
unto
the
jews
if
it
were
a
matter
of
wrong
or
wicked
lewdness
o
ye
jews
reason
would
that
i
should
bear
with
you
18
15
but
if
it
be
a
question
of
words
and
names
and
of
your
law
look
ye
to
it
for
i
will
be
no
judge
of
such
matters
18
16
and
he
drave
them
from
the
judgment
seat
18
17
then
all
the
greeks
took
sosthenes
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue
and
beat
him
before
the
judgment
seat
and
gallio
cared
for
none
of
those
things
18
18
and
paul
after
this
tarried
there
yet
a
good
while
and
then
took
his
leave
of
the
brethren
and
sailed
thence
into
syria
and
with
him
priscilla
and
aquila
having
shorn
his
head
in
cenchrea
for
he
had
a
vow
18
19
and
he
came
to
ephesus
and
left
them
there
but
he
himself
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
reasoned
with
the
jews
18
20
when
they
desired
him
to
tarry
longer
time
with
them
he
consented
not
18
21
but
bade
them
farewell
saying
i
must
by
all
means
keep
this
feast
that
cometh
in
jerusalem
but
i
will
return
again
unto
you
if
god
will
and
he
sailed
from
ephesus
18
22
and
when
he
had
landed
at
caesarea
and
gone
up
and
saluted
the
church
he
went
down
to
antioch
18
23
and
after
he
had
spent
some
time
there
he
departed
and
went
over
all
the
country
of
galatia
and
phrygia
in
order
strengthening
all
the
disciples
18
24
and
a
certain
jew
named
apollos
born
at
alexandria
an
eloquent
man
and
mighty
in
the
scriptures
came
to
ephesus
18
25
this
man
was
instructed
in
the
way
of
the
lord
and
being
fervent
in
the
spirit
he
spake
and
taught
diligently
the
things
of
the
lord
knowing
only
the
baptism
of
john
18
26
and
he
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
synagogue
whom
when
aquila
and
priscilla
had
heard
they
took
him
unto
them
and
expounded
unto
him
the
way
of
god
more
perfectly
18
27
and
when
he
was
disposed
to
pass
into
achaia
the
brethren
wrote
exhorting
the
disciples
to
receive
him
who
when
he
was
come
helped
them
much
which
had
believed
through
grace
18
28
for
he
mightily
convinced
the
jews
and
that
publickly
shewing
by
the
scriptures
that
jesus
was
christ
19
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
apollos
was
at
corinth
paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
ephesus
and
finding
certain
disciples
19
2
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
received
the
holy
ghost
since
ye
believed
and
they
said
unto
him
we
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
holy
ghost
19
3
and
he
said
unto
them
unto
what
then
were
ye
baptized
and
they
said
unto
john’s
baptism
19
4
then
said
paul
john
verily
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
repentance
saying
unto
the
people
that
they
should
believe
on
him
which
should
come
after
him
that
is
on
christ
jesus
19
5
when
they
heard
this
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
19
6
and
when
paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
them
the
holy
ghost
came
on
them
and
they
spake
with
tongues
and
prophesied
19
7
and
all
the
men
were
about
twelve
19
8
and
he
went
into
the
synagogue
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
of
three
months
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
19
9
but
when
divers
were
hardened
and
believed
not
but
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
multitude
he
departed
from
them
and
separated
the
disciples
disputing
daily
in
the
school
of
one
tyrannus
19
10
and
this
continued
by
the
space
of
two
years
so
that
all
they
which
dwelt
in
asia
heard
the
word
of
the
lord
jesus
both
jews
and
greeks
19
11
and
god
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
paul
19
12
so
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them
19
13
then
certain
of
the
vagabond
jews
exorcists
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
saying
we
adjure
you
by
jesus
whom
paul
preacheth
19
14
and
there
were
seven
sons
of
one
sceva
a
jew
and
chief
of
the
priests
which
did
so
19
15
and
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
said
jesus
i
know
and
paul
i
know
but
who
are
ye
19
16
and
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
them
and
overcame
them
and
prevailed
against
them
so
that
they
fled
out
of
that
house
naked
and
wounded
19
17
and
this
was
known
to
all
the
jews
and
greeks
also
dwelling
at
ephesus
and
fear
fell
on
them
all
and
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
was
magnified
19
18
and
many
that
believed
came
and
confessed
and
shewed
their
deeds
19
19
many
of
them
also
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
together
and
burned
them
before
all
men
and
they
counted
the
price
of
them
and
found
it
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
silver
19
20
so
mightily
grew
the
word
of
god
and
prevailed
19
21
after
these
things
were
ended
paul
purposed
in
the
spirit
when
he
had
passed
through
macedonia
and
achaia
to
go
to
jerusalem
saying
after
i
have
been
there
i
must
also
see
rome
19
22
so
he
sent
into
macedonia
two
of
them
that
ministered
unto
him
timotheus
and
erastus
but
he
himself
stayed
in
asia
for
a
season
19
23
and
the
same
time
there
arose
no
small
stir
about
that
way
19
24
for
a
certain
man
named
demetrius
a
silversmith
which
made
silver
shrines
for
diana
brought
no
small
gain
unto
the
craftsmen
19
25
whom
he
called
together
with
the
workmen
of
like
occupation
and
said
sirs
ye
know
that
by
this
craft
we
have
our
wealth
19
26
moreover
ye
see
and
hear
that
not
alone
at
ephesus
but
almost
throughout
all
asia
this
paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
people
saying
that
they
be
no
gods
which
are
made
with
hands
19
27
so
that
not
only
this
our
craft
is
in
danger
to
be
set
at
nought
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
diana
should
be
despised
and
her
magnificence
should
be
destroyed
whom
all
asia
and
the
world
worshippeth
19
28
and
when
they
heard
these
sayings
they
were
full
of
wrath
and
cried
out
saying
great
is
diana
of
the
ephesians
19
29
and
the
whole
city
was
filled
with
confusion
and
having
caught
gaius
and
aristarchus
men
of
macedonia
paul’s
companions
in
travel
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
theatre
19
30
and
when
paul
would
have
entered
in
unto
the
people
the
disciples
suffered
him
not
19
31
and
certain
of
the
chief
of
asia
which
were
his
friends
sent
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
adventure
himself
into
the
theatre
19
32
some
therefore
cried
one
thing
and
some
another
for
the
assembly
was
confused
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
they
were
come
together
19
33
and
they
drew
alexander
out
of
the
multitude
the
jews
putting
him
forward
and
alexander
beckoned
with
the
hand
and
would
have
made
his
defence
unto
the
people
19
34
but
when
they
knew
that
he
was
a
jew
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
out
great
is
diana
of
the
ephesians
19
35
and
when
the
townclerk
had
appeased
the
people
he
said
ye
men
of
ephesus
what
man
is
there
that
knoweth
not
how
that
the
city
of
the
ephesians
is
a
worshipper
of
the
great
goddess
diana
and
of
the
image
which
fell
down
from
jupiter
19
36
seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
be
spoken
against
ye
ought
to
be
quiet
and
to
do
nothing
rashly
19
37
for
ye
have
brought
hither
these
men
which
are
neither
robbers
of
churches
nor
yet
blasphemers
of
your
goddess
19
38
wherefore
if
demetrius
and
the
craftsmen
which
are
with
him
have
a
matter
against
any
man
the
law
is
open
and
there
are
deputies
let
them
implead
one
another
19
39
but
if
ye
enquire
any
thing
concerning
other
matters
it
shall
be
determined
in
a
lawful
assembly
19
40
for
we
are
in
danger
to
be
called
in
question
for
this
day’s
uproar
there
being
no
cause
whereby
we
may
give
an
account
of
this
concourse
19
41
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
dismissed
the
assembly
20
1
and
after
the
uproar
was
ceased
paul
called
unto
him
the
disciples
and
embraced
them
and
departed
for
to
go
into
macedonia
20
2
and
when
he
had
gone
over
those
parts
and
had
given
them
much
exhortation
he
came
into
greece
20
3
and
there
abode
three
months
and
when
the
jews
laid
wait
for
him
as
he
was
about
to
sail
into
syria
he
purposed
to
return
through
macedonia
20
4
and
there
accompanied
him
into
asia
sopater
of
berea
and
of
the
thessalonians
aristarchus
and
secundus
and
gaius
of
derbe
and
timotheus
and
of
asia
tychicus
and
trophimus
20
5
these
going
before
tarried
for
us
at
troas
20
6
and
we
sailed
away
from
philippi
after
the
days
of
unleavened
bread
and
came
unto
them
to
troas
in
five
days
where
we
abode
seven
days
20
7
and
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
bread
paul
preached
unto
them
ready
to
depart
on
the
morrow
and
continued
his
speech
until
midnight
20
8
and
there
were
many
lights
in
the
upper
chamber
where
they
were
gathered
together
20
9
and
there
sat
in
a
window
a
certain
young
man
named
eutychus
being
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
and
as
paul
was
long
preaching
he
sunk
down
with
sleep
and
fell
down
from
the
third
loft
and
was
taken
up
dead
20
10
and
paul
went
down
and
fell
on
him
and
embracing
him
said
trouble
not
yourselves
for
his
life
is
in
him
20
11
when
he
therefore
was
come
up
again
and
had
broken
bread
and
eaten
and
talked
a
long
while
even
till
break
of
day
so
he
departed
20
12
and
they
brought
the
young
man
alive
and
were
not
a
little
comforted
20
13
and
we
went
before
to
ship
and
sailed
unto
assos
there
intending
to
take
in
paul
for
so
had
he
appointed
minding
himself
to
go
afoot
20
14
and
when
he
met
with
us
at
assos
we
took
him
in
and
came
to
mitylene
20
15
and
we
sailed
thence
and
came
the
next
day
over
against
chios
and
the
next
day
we
arrived
at
samos
and
tarried
at
trogyllium
and
the
next
day
we
came
to
miletus
20
16
for
paul
had
determined
to
sail
by
ephesus
because
he
would
not
spend
the
time
in
asia
for
he
hasted
if
it
were
possible
for
him
to
be
at
jerusalem
the
day
of
pentecost
20
17
and
from
miletus
he
sent
to
ephesus
and
called
the
elders
of
the
church
20
18
and
when
they
were
come
to
him
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
from
the
first
day
that
i
came
into
asia
after
what
manner
i
have
been
with
you
at
all
seasons
20
19
serving
the
lord
with
all
humility
of
mind
and
with
many
tears
and
temptations
which
befell
me
by
the
lying
in
wait
of
the
jews
20
20
and
how
i
kept
back
nothing
that
was
profitable
unto
you
but
have
shewed
you
and
have
taught
you
publickly
and
from
house
to
house
20
21
testifying
both
to
the
jews
and
also
to
the
greeks
repentance
toward
god
and
faith
toward
our
lord
jesus
christ
20
22
and
now
behold
i
go
bound
in
the
spirit
unto
jerusalem
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
me
there
20
23
save
that
the
holy
ghost
witnesseth
in
every
city
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
me
20
24
but
none
of
these
things
move
me
neither
count
i
my
life
dear
unto
myself
so
that
i
might
finish
my
course
with
joy
and
the
ministry
which
i
have
received
of
the
lord
jesus
to
testify
the
gospel
of
the
grace
of
god
20
25
and
now
behold
i
know
that
ye
all
among
whom
i
have
gone
preaching
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
see
my
face
no
more
20
26
wherefore
i
take
you
to
record
this
day
that
i
am
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men
20
27
for
i
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
god
20
28
take
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
over
the
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
feed
the
church
of
god
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
blood
20
29
for
i
know
this
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
20
30
also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise
speaking
perverse
things
to
draw
away
disciples
after
them
20
31
therefore
watch
and
remember
that
by
the
space
of
three
years
i
ceased
not
to
warn
every
one
night
and
day
with
tears
20
32
and
now
brethren
i
commend
you
to
god
and
to
the
word
of
his
grace
which
is
able
to
build
you
up
and
to
give
you
an
inheritance
among
all
them
which
are
sanctified
20
33
i
have
coveted
no
man’s
silver
or
gold
or
apparel
20
34
yea
ye
yourselves
know
that
these
hands
have
ministered
unto
my
necessities
and
to
them
that
were
with
me
20
35
i
have
shewed
you
all
things
how
that
so
labouring
ye
ought
to
support
the
weak
and
to
remember
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
how
he
said
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
20
36
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
with
them
all
20
37
and
they
all
wept
sore
and
fell
on
paul’s
neck
and
kissed
him
20
38
sorrowing
most
of
all
for
the
words
which
he
spake
that
they
should
see
his
face
no
more
and
they
accompanied
him
unto
the
ship
21
1
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
were
gotten
from
them
and
had
launched
we
came
with
a
straight
course
unto
coos
and
the
day
following
unto
rhodes
and
from
thence
unto
patara
21
2
and
finding
a
ship
sailing
over
unto
phenicia
we
went
aboard
and
set
forth
21
3
now
when
we
had
discovered
cyprus
we
left
it
on
the
left
hand
and
sailed
into
syria
and
landed
at
tyre
for
there
the
ship
was
to
unlade
her
burden
21
4
and
finding
disciples
we
tarried
there
seven
days
who
said
to
paul
through
the
spirit
that
he
should
not
go
up
to
jerusalem
21
5
and
when
we
had
accomplished
those
days
we
departed
and
went
our
way
and
they
all
brought
us
on
our
way
with
wives
and
children
till
we
were
out
of
the
city
and
we
kneeled
down
on
the
shore
and
prayed
21
6
and
when
we
had
taken
our
leave
one
of
another
we
took
ship
and
they
returned
home
again
21
7
and
when
we
had
finished
our
course
from
tyre
we
came
to
ptolemais
and
saluted
the
brethren
and
abode
with
them
one
day
21
8
and
the
next
day
we
that
were
of
paul’s
company
departed
and
came
unto
caesarea
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
philip
the
evangelist
which
was
one
of
the
seven
and
abode
with
him
21
9
and
the
same
man
had
four
daughters
virgins
which
did
prophesy
21
10
and
as
we
tarried
there
many
days
there
came
down
from
judaea
a
certain
prophet
named
agabus
21
11
and
when
he
was
come
unto
us
he
took
paul’s
girdle
and
bound
his
own
hands
and
feet
and
said
thus
saith
the
holy
ghost
so
shall
the
jews
at
jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
girdle
and
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
gentiles
21
12
and
when
we
heard
these
things
both
we
and
they
of
that
place
besought
him
not
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
21
13
then
paul
answered
what
mean
ye
to
weep
and
to
break
mine
heart
for
i
am
ready
not
to
be
bound
only
but
also
to
die
at
jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
21
14
and
when
he
would
not
be
persuaded
we
ceased
saying
the
will
of
the
lord
be
done
21
15
and
after
those
days
we
took
up
our
carriages
and
went
up
to
jerusalem
21
16
there
went
with
us
also
certain
of
the
disciples
of
caesarea
and
brought
with
them
one
mnason
of
cyprus
an
old
disciple
with
whom
we
should
lodge
21
17
and
when
we
were
come
to
jerusalem
the
brethren
received
us
gladly
21
18
and
the
day
following
paul
went
in
with
us
unto
james
and
all
the
elders
were
present
21
19
and
when
he
had
saluted
them
he
declared
particularly
what
things
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
his
ministry
21
20
and
when
they
heard
it
they
glorified
the
lord
and
said
unto
him
thou
seest
brother
how
many
thousands
of
jews
there
are
which
believe
and
they
are
all
zealous
of
the
law
21
21
and
they
are
informed
of
thee
that
thou
teachest
all
the
jews
which
are
among
the
gentiles
to
forsake
moses
saying
that
they
ought
not
to
circumcise
their
children
neither
to
walk
after
the
customs
21
22
what
is
it
therefore
the
multitude
must
needs
come
together
for
they
will
hear
that
thou
art
come
21
23
do
therefore
this
that
we
say
to
thee
we
have
four
men
which
have
a
vow
on
them
21
24
them
take
and
purify
thyself
with
them
and
be
at
charges
with
them
that
they
may
shave
their
heads
and
all
may
know
that
those
things
whereof
they
were
informed
concerning
thee
are
nothing
but
that
thou
thyself
also
walkest
orderly
and
keepest
the
law
21
25
as
touching
the
gentiles
which
believe
we
have
written
and
concluded
that
they
observe
no
such
thing
save
only
that
they
keep
themselves
from
things
offered
to
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
strangled
and
from
fornication
21
26
then
paul
took
the
men
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
entered
into
the
temple
to
signify
the
accomplishment
of
the
days
of
purification
until
that
an
offering
should
be
offered
for
every
one
of
them
21
27
and
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
ended
the
jews
which
were
of
asia
when
they
saw
him
in
the
temple
stirred
up
all
the
people
and
laid
hands
on
him
21
28
crying
out
men
of
israel
help
this
is
the
man
that
teacheth
all
men
every
where
against
the
people
and
the
law
and
this
place
and
further
brought
greeks
also
into
the
temple
and
hath
polluted
this
holy
place
21
29
(for
they
had
seen
before
with
him
in
the
city
trophimus
an
ephesian
whom
they
supposed
that
paul
had
brought
into
the
temple
)
21
30
and
all
the
city
was
moved
and
the
people
ran
together
and
they
took
paul
and
drew
him
out
of
the
temple
and
forthwith
the
doors
were
shut
21
31
and
as
they
went
about
to
kill
him
tidings
came
unto
the
chief
captain
of
the
band
that
all
jerusalem
was
in
an
uproar
21
32
who
immediately
took
soldiers
and
centurions
and
ran
down
unto
them
and
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
soldiers
they
left
beating
of
paul
21
33
then
the
chief
captain
came
near
and
took
him
and
commanded
him
to
be
bound
with
two
chains
and
demanded
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
21
34
and
some
cried
one
thing
some
another
among
the
multitude
and
when
he
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
tumult
he
commanded
him
to
be
carried
into
the
castle
21
35
and
when
he
came
upon
the
stairs
so
it
was
that
he
was
borne
of
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
of
the
people
21
36
for
the
multitude
of
the
people
followed
after
crying
away
with
him
21
37
and
as
paul
was
to
be
led
into
the
castle
he
said
unto
the
chief
captain
may
i
speak
unto
thee
who
said
canst
thou
speak
greek
21
38
art
not
thou
that
egyptian
which
before
these
days
madest
an
uproar
and
leddest
out
into
the
wilderness
four
thousand
men
that
were
murderers
21
39
but
paul
said
i
am
a
man
which
am
a
jew
of
tarsus
a
city
in
cilicia
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city
and
i
beseech
thee
suffer
me
to
speak
unto
the
people
21
40
and
when
he
had
given
him
licence
paul
stood
on
the
stairs
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
people
and
when
there
was
made
a
great
silence
he
spake
unto
them
in
the
hebrew
tongue
saying
22
1
men
brethren
and
fathers
hear
ye
my
defence
which
i
make
now
unto
you
22
2
(and
when
they
heard
that
he
spake
in
the
hebrew
tongue
to
them
they
kept
the
more
silence
and
he
saith
)
22
3
i
am
verily
a
man
which
am
a
jew
born
in
tarsus
a
city
in
cilicia
yet
brought
up
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
gamaliel
and
taught
according
to
the
perfect
manner
of
the
law
of
the
fathers
and
was
zealous
toward
god
as
ye
all
are
this
day
22
4
and
i
persecuted
this
way
unto
the
death
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
women
22
5
as
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
me
witness
and
all
the
estate
of
the
elders
from
whom
also
i
received
letters
unto
the
brethren
and
went
to
damascus
to
bring
them
which
were
there
bound
unto
jerusalem
for
to
be
punished
22
6
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
i
made
my
journey
and
was
come
nigh
unto
damascus
about
noon
suddenly
there
shone
from
heaven
a
great
light
round
about
me
22
7
and
i
fell
unto
the
ground
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
22
8
and
i
answered
who
art
thou
lord
and
he
said
unto
me
i
am
jesus
of
nazareth
whom
thou
persecutest
22
9
and
they
that
were
with
me
saw
indeed
the
light
and
were
afraid
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
of
him
that
spake
to
me
22
10
and
i
said
what
shall
i
do
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
and
go
into
damascus
and
there
it
shall
be
told
thee
of
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
to
do
22
11
and
when
i
could
not
see
for
the
glory
of
that
light
being
led
by
the
hand
of
them
that
were
with
me
i
came
into
damascus
22
12
and
one
ananias
a
devout
man
according
to
the
law
having
a
good
report
of
all
the
jews
which
dwelt
there
22
13
came
unto
me
and
stood
and
said
unto
me
brother
saul
receive
thy
sight
and
the
same
hour
i
looked
up
upon
him
22
14
and
he
said
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
thee
that
thou
shouldest
know
his
will
and
see
that
just
one
and
shouldest
hear
the
voice
of
his
mouth
22
15
for
thou
shalt
be
his
witness
unto
all
men
of
what
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
22
16
and
now
why
tarriest
thou
arise
and
be
baptized
and
wash
away
thy
sins
calling
on
the
name
of
the
lord
22
17
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
was
come
again
to
jerusalem
even
while
i
prayed
in
the
temple
i
was
in
a
trance
22
18
and
saw
him
saying
unto
me
make
haste
and
get
thee
quickly
out
of
jerusalem
for
they
will
not
receive
thy
testimony
concerning
me
22
19
and
i
said
lord
they
know
that
i
imprisoned
and
beat
in
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
on
thee
22
20
and
when
the
blood
of
thy
martyr
stephen
was
shed
i
also
was
standing
by
and
consenting
unto
his
death
and
kept
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him
22
21
and
he
said
unto
me
depart
for
i
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
gentiles
22
22
and
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
word
and
then
lifted
up
their
voices
and
said
away
with
such
a
fellow
from
the
earth
for
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
live
22
23
and
as
they
cried
out
and
cast
off
their
clothes
and
threw
dust
into
the
air
22
24
the
chief
captain
commanded
him
to
be
brought
into
the
castle
and
bade
that
he
should
be
examined
by
scourging
that
he
might
know
wherefore
they
cried
so
against
him
22
25
and
as
they
bound
him
with
thongs
paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
by
is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
roman
and
uncondemned
22
26
when
the
centurion
heard
that
he
went
and
told
the
chief
captain
saying
take
heed
what
thou
doest
for
this
man
is
a
roman
22
27
then
the
chief
captain
came
and
said
unto
him
tell
me
art
thou
a
roman
he
said
yea
22
28
and
the
chief
captain
answered
with
a
great
sum
obtained
i
this
freedom
and
paul
said
but
i
was
free
born
22
29
then
straightway
they
departed
from
him
which
should
have
examined
him
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
afraid
after
he
knew
that
he
was
a
roman
and
because
he
had
bound
him
22
30
on
the
morrow
because
he
would
have
known
the
certainty
wherefore
he
was
accused
of
the
jews
he
loosed
him
from
his
bands
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
their
council
to
appear
and
brought
paul
down
and
set
him
before
them
23
1
and
paul
earnestly
beholding
the
council
said
men
and
brethren
i
have
lived
in
all
good
conscience
before
god
until
this
day
23
2
and
the
high
priest
ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
by
him
to
smite
him
on
the
mouth
23
3
then
said
paul
unto
him
god
shall
smite
thee
thou
whited
wall
for
sittest
thou
to
judge
me
after
the
law
and
commandest
me
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
law
23
4
and
they
that
stood
by
said
revilest
thou
god’s
high
priest
23
5
then
said
paul
i
wist
not
brethren
that
he
was
the
high
priest
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
of
the
ruler
of
thy
people
23
6
but
when
paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
sadducees
and
the
other
pharisees
he
cried
out
in
the
council
men
and
brethren
i
am
a
pharisee
the
son
of
a
pharisee
of
the
hope
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
question
23
7
and
when
he
had
so
said
there
arose
a
dissension
between
the
pharisees
and
the
sadducees
and
the
multitude
was
divided
23
8
for
the
sadducees
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection
neither
angel
nor
spirit
but
the
pharisees
confess
both
23
9
and
there
arose
a
great
cry
and
the
scribes
that
were
of
the
pharisees’
part
arose
and
strove
saying
we
find
no
evil
in
this
man
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
him
let
us
not
fight
against
god
23
10
and
when
there
arose
a
great
dissension
the
chief
captain
fearing
lest
paul
should
have
been
pulled
in
pieces
of
them
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
down
and
to
take
him
by
force
from
among
them
and
to
bring
him
into
the
castle
23
11
and
the
night
following
the
lord
stood
by
him
and
said
be
of
good
cheer
paul
for
as
thou
hast
testified
of
me
in
jerusalem
so
must
thou
bear
witness
also
at
rome
23
12
and
when
it
was
day
certain
of
the
jews
banded
together
and
bound
themselves
under
a
curse
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
paul
23
13
and
they
were
more
than
forty
which
had
made
this
conspiracy
23
14
and
they
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders
and
said
we
have
bound
ourselves
under
a
great
curse
that
we
will
eat
nothing
until
we
have
slain
paul
23
15
now
therefore
ye
with
the
council
signify
to
the
chief
captain
that
he
bring
him
down
unto
you
to
morrow
as
though
ye
would
enquire
something
more
perfectly
concerning
him
and
we
or
ever
he
come
near
are
ready
to
kill
him
23
16
and
when
paul’s
sister’s
son
heard
of
their
lying
in
wait
he
went
and
entered
into
the
castle
and
told
paul
23
17
then
paul
called
one
of
the
centurions
unto
him
and
said
bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
captain
for
he
hath
a
certain
thing
to
tell
him
23
18
so
he
took
him
and
brought
him
to
the
chief
captain
and
said
paul
the
prisoner
called
me
unto
him
and
prayed
me
to
bring
this
young
man
unto
thee
who
hath
something
to
say
unto
thee
23
19
then
the
chief
captain
took
him
by
the
hand
and
went
with
him
aside
privately
and
asked
him
what
is
that
thou
hast
to
tell
me
23
20
and
he
said
the
jews
have
agreed
to
desire
thee
that
thou
wouldest
bring
down
paul
to
morrow
into
the
council
as
though
they
would
enquire
somewhat
of
him
more
perfectly
23
21
but
do
not
thou
yield
unto
them
for
there
lie
in
wait
for
him
of
them
more
than
forty
men
which
have
bound
themselves
with
an
oath
that
they
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
killed
him
and
now
are
they
ready
looking
for
a
promise
from
thee
23
22
so
the
chief
captain
then
let
the
young
man
depart
and
charged
him
see
thou
tell
no
man
that
thou
hast
shewed
these
things
to
me
23
23
and
he
called
unto
him
two
centurions
saying
make
ready
two
hundred
soldiers
to
go
to
caesarea
and
horsemen
threescore
and
ten
and
spearmen
two
hundred
at
the
third
hour
of
the
night
23
24
and
provide
them
beasts
that
they
may
set
paul
on
and
bring
him
safe
unto
felix
the
governor
23
25
and
he
wrote
a
letter
after
this
manner
23
26
claudius
lysias
unto
the
most
excellent
governor
felix
sendeth
greeting
23
27
this
man
was
taken
of
the
jews
and
should
have
been
killed
of
them
then
came
i
with
an
army
and
rescued
him
having
understood
that
he
was
a
roman
23
28
and
when
i
would
have
known
the
cause
wherefore
they
accused
him
i
brought
him
forth
into
their
council
23
29
whom
i
perceived
to
be
accused
of
questions
of
their
law
but
to
have
nothing
laid
to
his
charge
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
23
30
and
when
it
was
told
me
how
that
the
jews
laid
wait
for
the
man
i
sent
straightway
to
thee
and
gave
commandment
to
his
accusers
also
to
say
before
thee
what
they
had
against
him
farewell
23
31
then
the
soldiers
as
it
was
commanded
them
took
paul
and
brought
him
by
night
to
antipatris
23
32
on
the
morrow
they
left
the
horsemen
to
go
with
him
and
returned
to
the
castle
23
33
who
when
they
came
to
caesarea
and
delivered
the
epistle
to
the
governor
presented
paul
also
before
him
23
34
and
when
the
governor
had
read
the
letter
he
asked
of
what
province
he
was
and
when
he
understood
that
he
was
of
cilicia
23
35
i
will
hear
thee
said
he
when
thine
accusers
are
also
come
and
he
commanded
him
to
be
kept
in
herod’s
judgment
hall
24
1
and
after
five
days
ananias
the
high
priest
descended
with
the
elders
and
with
a
certain
orator
named
tertullus
who
informed
the
governor
against
paul
24
2
and
when
he
was
called
forth
tertullus
began
to
accuse
him
saying
seeing
that
by
thee
we
enjoy
great
quietness
and
that
very
worthy
deeds
are
done
unto
this
nation
by
thy
providence
24
3
we
accept
it
always
and
in
all
places
most
noble
felix
with
all
thankfulness
24
4
notwithstanding
that
i
be
not
further
tedious
unto
thee
i
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
hear
us
of
thy
clemency
a
few
words
24
5
for
we
have
found
this
man
a
pestilent
fellow
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
jews
throughout
the
world
and
a
ringleader
of
the
sect
of
the
nazarenes
24
6
who
also
hath
gone
about
to
profane
the
temple
whom
we
took
and
would
have
judged
according
to
our
law
24
7
but
the
chief
captain
lysias
came
upon
us
and
with
great
violence
took
him
away
out
of
our
hands
24
8
commanding
his
accusers
to
come
unto
thee
by
examining
of
whom
thyself
mayest
take
knowledge
of
all
these
things
whereof
we
accuse
him
24
9
and
the
jews
also
assented
saying
that
these
things
were
so
24
10
then
paul
after
that
the
governor
had
beckoned
unto
him
to
speak
answered
forasmuch
as
i
know
that
thou
hast
been
of
many
years
a
judge
unto
this
nation
i
do
the
more
cheerfully
answer
for
myself
24
11
because
that
thou
mayest
understand
that
there
are
yet
but
twelve
days
since
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
for
to
worship
24
12
and
they
neither
found
me
in
the
temple
disputing
with
any
man
neither
raising
up
the
people
neither
in
the
synagogues
nor
in
the
city
24
13
neither
can
they
prove
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
me
24
14
but
this
i
confess
unto
thee
that
after
the
way
which
they
call
heresy
so
worship
i
the
god
of
my
fathers
believing
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets
24
15
and
have
hope
toward
god
which
they
themselves
also
allow
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
dead
both
of
the
just
and
unjust
24
16
and
herein
do
i
exercise
myself
to
have
always
a
conscience
void
to
offence
toward
god
and
toward
men
24
17
now
after
many
years
i
came
to
bring
alms
to
my
nation
and
offerings
24
18
whereupon
certain
jews
from
asia
found
me
purified
in
the
temple
neither
with
multitude
nor
with
tumult
24
19
who
ought
to
have
been
here
before
thee
and
object
if
they
had
ought
against
me
24
20
or
else
let
these
same
here
say
if
they
have
found
any
evil
doing
in
me
while
i
stood
before
the
council
24
21
except
it
be
for
this
one
voice
that
i
cried
standing
among
them
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
question
by
you
this
day
24
22
and
when
felix
heard
these
things
having
more
perfect
knowledge
of
that
way
he
deferred
them
and
said
when
lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
down
i
will
know
the
uttermost
of
your
matter
24
23
and
he
commanded
a
centurion
to
keep
paul
and
to
let
him
have
liberty
and
that
he
should
forbid
none
of
his
acquaintance
to
minister
or
come
unto
him
24
24
and
after
certain
days
when
felix
came
with
his
wife
drusilla
which
was
a
jewess
he
sent
for
paul
and
heard
him
concerning
the
faith
in
christ
24
25
and
as
he
reasoned
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
to
come
felix
trembled
and
answered
go
thy
way
for
this
time
when
i
have
a
convenient
season
i
will
call
for
thee
24
26
he
hoped
also
that
money
should
have
been
given
him
of
paul
that
he
might
loose
him
wherefore
he
sent
for
him
the
oftener
and
communed
with
him
24
27
but
after
two
years
porcius
festus
came
into
felix’
room
and
felix
willing
to
shew
the
jews
a
pleasure
left
paul
bound
25
1
now
when
festus
was
come
into
the
province
after
three
days
he
ascended
from
caesarea
to
jerusalem
25
2
then
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
of
the
jews
informed
him
against
paul
and
besought
him
25
3
and
desired
favour
against
him
that
he
would
send
for
him
to
jerusalem
laying
wait
in
the
way
to
kill
him
25
4
but
festus
answered
that
paul
should
be
kept
at
caesarea
and
that
he
himself
would
depart
shortly
thither
25
5
let
them
therefore
said
he
which
among
you
are
able
go
down
with
me
and
accuse
this
man
if
there
be
any
wickedness
in
him
25
6
and
when
he
had
tarried
among
them
more
than
ten
days
he
went
down
unto
caesarea
and
the
next
day
sitting
on
the
judgment
seat
commanded
paul
to
be
brought
25
7
and
when
he
was
come
the
jews
which
came
down
from
jerusalem
stood
round
about
and
laid
many
and
grievous
complaints
against
paul
which
they
could
not
prove
25
8
while
he
answered
for
himself
neither
against
the
law
of
the
jews
neither
against
the
temple
nor
yet
against
caesar
have
i
offended
any
thing
at
all
25
9
but
festus
willing
to
do
the
jews
a
pleasure
answered
paul
and
said
wilt
thou
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
there
be
judged
of
these
things
before
me
25
10
then
said
paul
i
stand
at
caesar’s
judgment
seat
where
i
ought
to
be
judged
to
the
jews
have
i
done
no
wrong
as
thou
very
well
knowest
25
11
for
if
i
be
an
offender
or
have
committed
any
thing
worthy
of
death
i
refuse
not
to
die
but
if
there
be
none
of
these
things
whereof
these
accuse
me
no
man
may
deliver
me
unto
them
i
appeal
unto
caesar
25
12
then
festus
when
he
had
conferred
with
the
council
answered
hast
thou
appealed
unto
caesar
unto
caesar
shalt
thou
go
25
13
and
after
certain
days
king
agrippa
and
bernice
came
unto
caesarea
to
salute
festus
25
14
and
when
they
had
been
there
many
days
festus
declared
paul’s
cause
unto
the
king
saying
there
is
a
certain
man
left
in
bonds
by
felix
25
15
about
whom
when
i
was
at
jerusalem
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
jews
informed
me
desiring
to
have
judgment
against
him
25
16
to
whom
i
answered
it
is
not
the
manner
of
the
romans
to
deliver
any
man
to
die
before
that
he
which
is
accused
have
the
accusers
face
to
face
and
have
licence
to
answer
for
himself
concerning
the
crime
laid
against
him
25
17
therefore
when
they
were
come
hither
without
any
delay
on
the
morrow
i
sat
on
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
forth
25
18
against
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
up
they
brought
none
accusation
of
such
things
as
i
supposed
25
19
but
had
certain
questions
against
him
of
their
own
superstition
and
of
one
jesus
which
was
dead
whom
paul
affirmed
to
be
alive
25
20
and
because
i
doubted
of
such
manner
of
questions
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
go
to
jerusalem
and
there
be
judged
of
these
matters
25
21
but
when
paul
had
appealed
to
be
reserved
unto
the
hearing
of
augustus
i
commanded
him
to
be
kept
till
i
might
send
him
to
caesar
25
22
then
agrippa
said
unto
festus
i
would
also
hear
the
man
myself
to
morrow
said
he
thou
shalt
hear
him
25
23
and
on
the
morrow
when
agrippa
was
come
and
bernice
with
great
pomp
and
was
entered
into
the
place
of
hearing
with
the
chief
captains
and
principal
men
of
the
city
at
festus’
commandment
paul
was
brought
forth
25
24
and
festus
said
king
agrippa
and
all
men
which
are
here
present
with
us
ye
see
this
man
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of
the
jews
have
dealt
with
me
both
at
jerusalem
and
also
here
crying
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
longer
25
25
but
when
i
found
that
he
had
committed
nothing
worthy
of
death
and
that
he
himself
hath
appealed
to
augustus
i
have
determined
to
send
him
25
26
of
whom
i
have
no
certain
thing
to
write
unto
my
lord
wherefore
i
have
brought
him
forth
before
you
and
specially
before
thee
o
king
agrippa
that
after
examination
had
i
might
have
somewhat
to
write
25
27
for
it
seemeth
to
me
unreasonable
to
send
a
prisoner
and
not
withal
to
signify
the
crimes
laid
against
him
26
1
then
agrippa
said
unto
paul
thou
art
permitted
to
speak
for
thyself
then
paul
stretched
forth
the
hand
and
answered
for
himself
26
2
i
think
myself
happy
king
agrippa
because
i
shall
answer
for
myself
this
day
before
thee
touching
all
the
things
whereof
i
am
accused
of
the
jews
26
3
especially
because
i
know
thee
to
be
expert
in
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the
jews
wherefore
i
beseech
thee
to
hear
me
patiently
26
4
my
manner
of
life
from
my
youth
which
was
at
the
first
among
mine
own
nation
at
jerusalem
know
all
the
jews
26
5
which
knew
me
from
the
beginning
if
they
would
testify
that
after
the
most
straitest
sect
of
our
religion
i
lived
a
pharisee
26
6
and
now
i
stand
and
am
judged
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
made
of
god
unto
our
fathers
26
7
unto
which
promise
our
twelve
tribes
instantly
serving
god
day
and
night
hope
to
come
for
which
hope’s
sake
king
agrippa
i
am
accused
of
the
jews
26
8
why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
you
that
god
should
raise
the
dead
26
9
i
verily
thought
with
myself
that
i
ought
to
do
many
things
contrary
to
the
name
of
jesus
of
nazareth
26
10
which
thing
i
also
did
in
jerusalem
and
many
of
the
saints
did
i
shut
up
in
prison
having
received
authority
from
the
chief
priests
and
when
they
were
put
to
death
i
gave
my
voice
against
them
26
11
and
i
punished
them
oft
in
every
synagogue
and
compelled
them
to
blaspheme
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against
them
i
persecuted
them
even
unto
strange
cities
26
12
whereupon
as
i
went
to
damascus
with
authority
and
commission
from
the
chief
priests
26
13
at
midday
o
king
i
saw
in
the
way
a
light
from
heaven
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun
shining
round
about
me
and
them
which
journeyed
with
me
26
14
and
when
we
were
all
fallen
to
the
earth
i
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
me
and
saying
in
the
hebrew
tongue
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
26
15
and
i
said
who
art
thou
lord
and
he
said
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
26
16
but
rise
and
stand
upon
thy
feet
for
i
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
purpose
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
i
will
appear
unto
thee
26
17
delivering
thee
from
the
people
and
from
the
gentiles
unto
whom
now
i
send
thee
26
18
to
open
their
eyes
and
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
light
and
from
the
power
of
satan
unto
god
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
me
26
19
whereupon
o
king
agrippa
i
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly

but
shewed
first
unto
them
of
damascus
and
at
jerusalem
and
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
judaea
and
then
to
the
gentiles
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
god
and
do
works
meet
for
repentance
26
21
for
these
causes
the
jews
caught
me
in
the
temple
and
went
about
to
kill
me
26
22
having
therefore
obtained
help
of
god
i
continue
unto
this
day
witnessing
both
to
small
and
great
saying
none
other
things
than
those
which
the
prophets
and
moses
did
say
should
come
26
23
that
christ
should
suffer
and
that
he
should
be
the
first
that
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
should
shew
light
unto
the
people
and
to
the
gentiles
26
24
and
as
he
thus
spake
for
himself
festus
said
with
a
loud
voice
paul
thou
art
beside
thyself
much
learning
doth
make
thee
mad
26
25
but
he
said
i
am
not
mad
most
noble
festus
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness
26
26
for
the
king
knoweth
of
these
things
before
whom
also
i
speak
freely
for
i
am
persuaded
that
none
of
these
things
are
hidden
from
him
for
this
thing
was
not
done
in
a
corner
26
27
king
agrippa
believest
thou
the
prophets
i
know
that
thou
believest
26
28
then
agrippa
said
unto
paul
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
26
29
and
paul
said
i
would
to
god
that
not
only
thou
but
also
all
that
hear
me
this
day
were
both
almost
and
altogether
such
as
i
am
except
these
bonds
26
30
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
the
king
rose
up
and
the
governor
and
bernice
and
they
that
sat
with
them
26
31
and
when
they
were
gone
aside
they
talked
between
themselves
saying
this
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
26
32
then
said
agrippa
unto
festus
this
man
might
have
been
set
at
liberty
if
he
had
not
appealed
unto
caesar
27
1
and
when
it
was
determined
that
we
should
sail
into
italy
they
delivered
paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
unto
one
named
julius
a
centurion
of
augustus’
band
27
2
and
entering
into
a
ship
of
adramyttium
we
launched
meaning
to
sail
by
the
coasts
of
asia
one
aristarchus
a
macedonian
of
thessalonica
being
with
us
27
3
and
the
next
day
we
touched
at
sidon
and
julius
courteously
entreated
paul
and
gave
him
liberty
to
go
unto
his
friends
to
refresh
himself
27
4
and
when
we
had
launched
from
thence
we
sailed
under
cyprus
because
the
winds
were
contrary
27
5
and
when
we
had
sailed
over
the
sea
of
cilicia
and
pamphylia
we
came
to
myra
a
city
of
lycia
27
6
and
there
the
centurion
found
a
ship
of
alexandria
sailing
into
italy
and
he
put
us
therein
27
7
and
when
we
had
sailed
slowly
many
days
and
scarce
were
come
over
against
cnidus
the
wind
not
suffering
us
we
sailed
under
crete
over
against
salmone
27
8
and
hardly
passing
it
came
unto
a
place
which
is
called
the
fair
havens
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
of
lasea
27
9
now
when
much
time
was
spent
and
when
sailing
was
now
dangerous
because
the
fast
was
now
already
past
paul
admonished
them
27
10
and
said
unto
them
sirs
i
perceive
that
this
voyage
will
be
with
hurt
and
much
damage
not
only
of
the
lading
and
ship
but
also
of
our
lives
27
11
nevertheless
the
centurion
believed
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
ship
more
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
paul
27
12
and
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
to
winter
in
the
more
part
advised
to
depart
thence
also
if
by
any
means
they
might
attain
to
phenice
and
there
to
winter
which
is
an
haven
of
crete
and
lieth
toward
the
south
west
and
north
west
27
13
and
when
the
south
wind
blew
softly
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
their
purpose
loosing
thence
they
sailed
close
by
crete
27
14
but
not
long
after
there
arose
against
it
a
tempestuous
wind
called
euroclydon
27
15
and
when
the
ship
was
caught
and
could
not
bear
up
into
the
wind
we
let
her
drive
27
16
and
running
under
a
certain
island
which
is
called
clauda
we
had
much
work
to
come
by
the
boat
27
17
which
when
they
had
taken
up
they
used
helps
undergirding
the
ship
and
fearing
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
quicksands
strake
sail
and
so
were
driven
27
18
and
we
being
exceedingly
tossed
with
a
tempest
the
next
day
they
lightened
the
ship
27
19
and
the
third
day
we
cast
out
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
of
the
ship
27
20
and
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
in
many
days
appeared
and
no
small
tempest
lay
on
us
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
was
then
taken
away
27
21
but
after
long
abstinence
paul
stood
forth
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
sirs
ye
should
have
hearkened
unto
me
and
not
have
loosed
from
crete
and
to
have
gained
this
harm
and
loss
27
22
and
now
i
exhort
you
to
be
of
good
cheer
for
there
shall
be
no
loss
of
any
man’s
life
among
you
but
of
the
ship
27
23
for
there
stood
by
me
this
night
the
angel
of
god
whose
i
am
and
whom
i
serve
27
24
saying
fear
not
paul
thou
must
be
brought
before
caesar
and
lo
god
hath
given
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
thee
27
25
wherefore
sirs
be
of
good
cheer
for
i
believe
god
that
it
shall
be
even
as
it
was
told
me
27
26
howbeit
we
must
be
cast
upon
a
certain
island
27
27
but
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
come
as
we
were
driven
up
and
down
in
adria
about
midnight
the
shipmen
deemed
that
they
drew
near
to
some
country
27
28
and
sounded
and
found
it
twenty
fathoms
and
when
they
had
gone
a
little
further
they
sounded
again
and
found
it
fifteen
fathoms
27
29
then
fearing
lest
we
should
have
fallen
upon
rocks
they
cast
four
anchors
out
of
the
stern
and
wished
for
the
day
27
30
and
as
the
shipmen
were
about
to
flee
out
of
the
ship
when
they
had
let
down
the
boat
into
the
sea
under
colour
as
though
they
would
have
cast
anchors
out
of
the
foreship
27
31
paul
said
to
the
centurion
and
to
the
soldiers
except
these
abide
in
the
ship
ye
cannot
be
saved
27
32
then
the
soldiers
cut
off
the
ropes
of
the
boat
and
let
her
fall
off
27
33
and
while
the
day
was
coming
on
paul
besought
them
all
to
take
meat
saying
this
day
is
the
fourteenth
day
that
ye
have
tarried
and
continued
fasting
having
taken
nothing
27
34
wherefore
i
pray
you
to
take
some
meat
for
this
is
for
your
health
for
there
shall
not
an
hair
fall
from
the
head
of
any
of
you
27
35
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
took
bread
and
gave
thanks
to
god
in
presence
of
them
all
and
when
he
had
broken
it
he
began
to
eat
27
36
then
were
they
all
of
good
cheer
and
they
also
took
some
meat
27
37
and
we
were
in
all
in
the
ship
two
hundred
threescore
and
sixteen
souls
27
38
and
when
they
had
eaten
enough
they
lightened
the
ship
and
cast
out
the
wheat
into
the
sea
27
39
and
when
it
was
day
they
knew
not
the
land
but
they
discovered
a
certain
creek
with
a
shore
into
the
which
they
were
minded
if
it
were
possible
to
thrust
in
the
ship
27
40
and
when
they
had
taken
up
the
anchors
they
committed
themselves
unto
the
sea
and
loosed
the
rudder
bands
and
hoised
up
the
mainsail
to
the
wind
and
made
toward
shore
27
41
and
falling
into
a
place
where
two
seas
met
they
ran
the
ship
aground
and
the
forepart
stuck
fast
and
remained
unmoveable
but
the
hinder
part
was
broken
with
the
violence
of
the
waves
27
42
and
the
soldiers’
counsel
was
to
kill
the
prisoners
lest
any
of
them
should
swim
out
and
escape
27
43
but
the
centurion
willing
to
save
paul
kept
them
from
their
purpose
and
commanded
that
they
which
could
swim
should
cast
themselves
first
into
the
sea
and
get
to
land
27
44
and
the
rest
some
on
boards
and
some
on
broken
pieces
of
the
ship
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
they
escaped
all
safe
to
land
28
1
and
when
they
were
escaped
then
they
knew
that
the
island
was
called
melita
28
2
and
the
barbarous
people
shewed
us
no
little
kindness
for
they
kindled
a
fire
and
received
us
every
one
because
of
the
present
rain
and
because
of
the
cold
28
3
and
when
paul
had
gathered
a
bundle
of
sticks
and
laid
them
on
the
fire
there
came
a
viper
out
of
the
heat
and
fastened
on
his
hand
28
4
and
when
the
barbarians
saw
the
venomous
beast
hang
on
his
hand
they
said
among
themselves
no
doubt
this
man
is
a
murderer
whom
though
he
hath
escaped
the
sea
yet
vengeance
suffereth
not
to
live
28
5
and
he
shook
off
the
beast
into
the
fire
and
felt
no
harm
28
6
howbeit
they
looked
when
he
should
have
swollen
or
fallen
down
dead
suddenly
but
after
they
had
looked
a
great
while
and
saw
no
harm
come
to
him
they
changed
their
minds
and
said
that
he
was
a
god
28
7
in
the
same
quarters
were
possessions
of
the
chief
man
of
the
island
whose
name
was
publius
who
received
us
and
lodged
us
three
days
courteously
28
8
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
father
of
publius
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
of
a
bloody
flux
to
whom
paul
entered
in
and
prayed
and
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
healed
him
28
9
so
when
this
was
done
others
also
which
had
diseases
in
the
island
came
and
were
healed
28
10
who
also
honoured
us
with
many
honours
and
when
we
departed
they
laded
us
with
such
things
as
were
necessary
28
11
and
after
three
months
we
departed
in
a
ship
of
alexandria
which
had
wintered
in
the
isle
whose
sign
was
castor
and
pollux
28
12
and
landing
at
syracuse
we
tarried
there
three
days
28
13
and
from
thence
we
fetched
a
compass
and
came
to
rhegium
and
after
one
day
the
south
wind
blew
and
we
came
the
next
day
to
puteoli
28
14
where
we
found
brethren
and
were
desired
to
tarry
with
them
seven
days
and
so
we
went
toward
rome
28
15
and
from
thence
when
the
brethren
heard
of
us
they
came
to
meet
us
as
far
as
appii
forum
and
the
three
taverns
whom
when
paul
saw
he
thanked
god
and
took
courage
28
16
and
when
we
came
to
rome
the
centurion
delivered
the
prisoners
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
but
paul
was
suffered
to
dwell
by
himself
with
a
soldier
that
kept
him
28
17
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
days
paul
called
the
chief
of
the
jews
together
and
when
they
were
come
together
he
said
unto
them
men
and
brethren
though
i
have
committed
nothing
against
the
people
or
customs
of
our
fathers
yet
was
i
delivered
prisoner
from
jerusalem
into
the
hands
of
the
romans
28
18
who
when
they
had
examined
me
would
have
let
me
go
because
there
was
no
cause
of
death
in
me
28
19
but
when
the
jews
spake
against
it
i
was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
caesar
not
that
i
had
ought
to
accuse
my
nation
of
28
20
for
this
cause
therefore
have
i
called
for
you
to
see
you
and
to
speak
with
you
because
that
for
the
hope
of
israel
i
am
bound
with
this
chain
28
21
and
they
said
unto
him
we
neither
received
letters
out
of
judaea
concerning
thee
neither
any
of
the
brethren
that
came
shewed
or
spake
any
harm
of
thee
28
22
but
we
desire
to
hear
of
thee
what
thou
thinkest
for
as
concerning
this
sect
we
know
that
every
where
it
is
spoken
against
28
23
and
when
they
had
appointed
him
a
day
there
came
many
to
him
into
his
lodging
to
whom
he
expounded
and
testified
the
kingdom
of
god
persuading
them
concerning
jesus
both
out
of
the
law
of
moses
and
out
of
the
prophets
from
morning
till
evening
28
24
and
some
believed
the
things
which
were
spoken
and
some
believed
not
28
25
and
when
they
agreed
not
among
themselves
they
departed
after
that
paul
had
spoken
one
word
well
spake
the
holy
ghost
by
esaias
the
prophet
unto
our
fathers
28
26
saying
go
unto
this
people
and
say
hearing
ye
shall
hear
and
shall
not
understand
and
seeing
ye
shall
see
and
not
perceive
28
27
for
the
heart
of
this
people
is
waxed
gross
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing
and
their
eyes
have
they
closed
lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
28
28
be
it
known
therefore
unto
you
that
the
salvation
of
god
is
sent
unto
the
gentiles
and
that
they
will
hear
it
28
29
and
when
he
had
said
these
words
the
jews
departed
and
had
great
reasoning
among
themselves
28
30
and
paul
dwelt
two
whole
years
in
his
own
hired
house
and
received
all
that
came
in
unto
him
28
31
preaching
the
kingdom
of
god
and
teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
lord
jesus
christ
with
all
confidence
no
man
forbidding
him
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
romans
1

paul
a
servant
of
jesus
christ
called
to
be
an
apostle
separated
unto
the
gospel
of

(which
he
had
promised
afore
by
his
prophets
in
the
holy
scriptures
)

concerning
his
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
which
was
made
of

according
to
the
flesh
1

and
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
with
power
according
to
the
spirit
of
holiness
by
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
1

by
whom
we
have
received
grace
and
apostleship
for
obedience
to
the
faith
among
all
nations
for
his
name

among

grace
to

first
i
thank
my
god
through
jesus
christ
for
you
all
that
your
faith
is
spoken
of
throughout
the
whole

for
god
is
my
witness

i
serve
with
my
spirit
in
the
gospel
of

son
that
without
ceasing
i
make
mention

in
my
prayers

request
if

any
means
now
at
length
i
might
have
a
prosperous
journey
by
the
will
of
god
to
come
unto
you

11
for
i
long
to
see
you
that
i
may
impart
unto
you
some
spiritual
gift
to
the
end
ye
may
be
established
1
12
that
is
that
i
may
be
comforted
together
with
you
by
the
mutual
faith
both
of
you
and
me
1
13
now
i
would
not
have
you
ignorant
brethren
that
oftentimes
i
purposed
to
come
unto
you
(but
was
let
hitherto
)
that
i
might
have
some
fruit
among
you
also
even
as
among
other
gentiles
1
14
i
am
debtor
both
to
the
greeks
and
to
the
barbarians
both
to
the
wise
and
to
the
unwise
1
15
so
as
much
as
in
me
is
i
am
ready
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
that
are
at
rome
also
1
16
for
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
gospel
of
christ
for
it
is
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth
to
the
jew
first
and
also
to
the
greek
1
17
for
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
god
revealed
from
faith
to
faith
as
it
is
written
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
1
18
for
the
wrath
of
god
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
who
hold
the
truth
in
unrighteousness
1
19
because
that
which
may
be
known
of
god
is
manifest
in
them
for
god
hath
shewed
it
unto
them
1
20
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
so
that
they
are
without
excuse
1
21
because
that
when
they
knew
god
they
glorified
him
not
as
god
neither
were
thankful
but
became
vain
in
their
imaginations
and
their
foolish
heart
was
darkened
1
22
professing
themselves
to
be
wise
they
became
fools
1
23
and
changed
the
glory
of
the
uncorruptible
god
into
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
man
and
to
birds
and
fourfooted
beasts
and
creeping
things
1
24
wherefore
god
also
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
hearts
to
dishonour
their
own
bodies
between
themselves
1
25
who
changed
the
truth
of
god
into
a
lie
and
worshipped
and
served
the
creature
more
than
the
creator
who
is
blessed
for
ever
amen
1
26
for
this
cause
god
gave
them
up
unto
vile
affections
for
even
their
women
did
change
the
natural
use
into
that
which
is
against
nature
1
27
and
likewise
also
the
men
leaving
the
natural
use
of
the
woman
burned
in
their
lust
one
toward
another
men
with
men
working
that
which
is
unseemly
and
receiving
in
themselves
that
recompence
of
their
error
which
was
meet
1
28
and
even
as
they
did
not
like
to
retain
god
in
their
knowledge
god
gave
them
over
to
a
reprobate
mind
to
do
those
things
which
are
not
convenient
1
29
being
filled
with
all
unrighteousness
fornication
wickedness
covetousness
maliciousness
full
of
envy
murder
debate
deceit
malignity
whisperers
1
30
backbiters
haters
of
god
despiteful
proud
boasters
inventors
of
evil
things
disobedient
to
parents
1
31
without
understanding
covenantbreakers
without
natural
affection
implacable
unmerciful
1
32
who
knowing
the
judgment
of
god
that
they
which
commit
such
things
are
worthy
of
death
not
only
do
the
same
but
have
pleasure
in
them
that
do
them
2
1
therefore
thou
art
inexcusable
o
man
whosoever
thou
art
that
judgest
for
wherein
thou
judgest
another
thou
condemnest
thyself
for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the
same
things
2
2
but
we
are
sure
that
the
judgment
of
god
is
according
to
truth
against
them
which
commit
such
things
2
3
and
thinkest
thou
this
o
man
that
judgest
them
which
do
such
things
and
doest
the
same
that
thou
shalt
escape
the
judgment
of
god
2
4
or
despisest
thou
the
riches
of
his
goodness
and
forbearance
and
longsuffering
not
knowing
that
the
goodness
of
god
leadeth
thee
to
repentance
2
5
but
after
thy
hardness
and
impenitent
heart
treasurest
up
unto
thyself
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
revelation
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
2
6
who
will
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
deeds
2
7
to
them
who
by
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
seek
for
glory
and
honour
and
immortality
eternal
life
2
8
but
unto
them
that
are
contentious
and
do
not
obey
the
truth
but
obey
unrighteousness
indignation
and
wrath
2
9
tribulation
and
anguish
upon
every
soul
of
man
that
doeth
evil
of
the
jew
first
and
also
of
the
gentile
2
10
but
glory
honour
and
peace
to
every
man
that
worketh
good
to
the
jew
first
and
also
to
the
gentile
2
11
for
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
with
god
2
12
for
as
many
as
have
sinned
without
law
shall
also
perish
without
law
and
as
many
as
have
sinned
in
the
law
shall
be
judged
by
the
law
2
13
(for
not
the
hearers
of
the
law
are
just
before
god
but
the
doers
of
the
law
shall
be
justified
2
14
for
when
the
gentiles
which
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law
these
having
not
the
law
are
a
law
unto
themselves
2
15
which
shew
the
work
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts
their
conscience
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
another
)
2
16
in
the
day
when
god
shall
judge
the
secrets
of
men
by
jesus
christ
according
to
my
gospel
2
17
behold
thou
art
called
a
jew
and
restest
in
the
law
and
makest
thy
boast
of
god
2
18
and
knowest
his
will
and
approvest
the
things
that
are
more
excellent
being
instructed
out
of
the
law
2
19
and
art
confident
that
thou
thyself
art
a
guide
of
the
blind
a
light
of
them
which
are
in
darkness
2
20
an
instructor
of
the
foolish
a
teacher
of
babes
which
hast
the
form
of
knowledge
and
of
the
truth
in
the
law
2
21
thou
therefore
which
teachest
another
teachest
thou
not
thyself
thou
that
preachest
a
man
should
not
steal
dost
thou
steal
2
22
thou
that
sayest
a
man
should
not
commit
adultery
dost
thou
commit
adultery
thou
that
abhorrest
idols
dost
thou
commit
sacrilege
2
23
thou
that
makest
thy
boast
of
the
law
through
breaking
the
law
dishonourest
thou
god
2
24
for
the
name
of
god
is
blasphemed
among
the
gentiles
through
you
as
it
is
written
2
25
for
circumcision
verily
profiteth
if
thou
keep
the
law
but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of
the
law
thy
circumcision
is
made
uncircumcision
2
26
therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
law
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision
2
27
and
shall
not
uncircumcision
which
is
by
nature
if
it
fulfil
the
law
judge
thee
who
by
the
letter
and
circumcision
dost
transgress
the
law
2
28
for
he
is
not
a
jew
which
is
one
outwardly
neither
is
that
circumcision
which
is
outward
in
the
flesh
2
29
but
he
is
a
jew
which
is
one
inwardly
and
circumcision
is
that
of
the
heart
in
the
spirit
and
not
in
the
letter
whose
praise
is
not
of
men
but
of
god
3
1
what
advantage
then
hath
the
jew
or
what
profit
is
there
of
circumcision
3
2
much
every
way
chiefly
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of
god
3
3
for
what
if
some
did
not
believe
shall
their
unbelief
make
the
faith
of
god
without
effect
3
4
god
forbid
yea
let
god
be
true
but
every
man
a
liar
as
it
is
written
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
in
thy
sayings
and
mightest
overcome
when
thou
art
judged
3
5
but
if
our
unrighteousness
commend
the
righteousness
of
god
what
shall
we
say
is
god
unrighteous
who
taketh
vengeance
(i
speak
as
a
man)
3
6
god
forbid
for
then
how
shall
god
judge
the
world
3
7
for
if
the
truth
of
god
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
glory
why
yet
am
i
also
judged
as
a
sinner
3
8
and
not
rather
(as
we
be
slanderously
reported
and
as
some
affirm
that
we
say
)
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
whose
damnation
is
just
3
9
what
then
are
we
better
than
they
no
in
no
wise
for
we
have
before
proved
both
jews
and
gentiles
that
they
are
all
under
sin
3
10
as
it
is
written
there
is
none
righteous
no
not
one
3
11
there
is
none
that
understandeth
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
god
3
12
they
are
all
gone
out
of
the
way
they
are
together
become
unprofitable
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
3
13
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
deceit
the
poison
of
asps
is
under
their
lips
3
14
whose
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
bitterness
3
15
their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
3
16
destruction
and
misery
are
in
their
ways
3
17
and
the
way
of
peace
have
they
not
known
3
18
there
is
no
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
3
19
now
we
know
that
what
things
soever
the
law
saith
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under
the
law
that
every
mouth
may
be
stopped
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
god
3
20
therefore
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
in
his
sight
for
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
sin
3
21
but
now
the
righteousness
of
god
without
the
law
is
manifested
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
prophets
3
22
even
the
righteousness
of
god
which
is
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
unto
all
and
upon
all
them
that
believe
for
there
is
no
difference
3
23
for
all
have
sinned
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
god
3
24
being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
3
25
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
past
through
the
forbearance
of
god
3
26
to
declare
i
say
at
this
time
his
righteousness
that
he
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
jesus
3
27
where
is
boasting
then
it
is
excluded
by
what
law
of
works
nay
but
by
the
law
of
faith
3
28
therefore
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
3
29
is
he
the
god
of
the
jews
only
is
he
not
also
of
the
gentiles
yes
of
the
gentiles
also
3
30
seeing
it
is
one
god
which
shall
justify
the
circumcision
by
faith
and
uncircumcision
through
faith
3
31
do
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
faith
god
forbid
yea
we
establish
the
law
4
1
what
shall
we
say
then
that
abraham
our
father
as
pertaining
to
the
flesh
hath
found
4
2
for
if
abraham
were
justified
by
works
he
hath
whereof
to
glory
but
not
before
god
4
3
for
what
saith
the
scripture
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
4
4
now
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
grace
but
of
debt
4
5
but
to
him
that
worketh
not
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly
his
faith
is
counted
for
righteousness
4
6
even
as
david
also
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
man
unto
whom
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
works
4
7
saying
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
are
covered
4
8
blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
lord
will
not
impute
sin
4
9
cometh
this
blessedness
then
upon
the
circumcision
only
or
upon
the
uncircumcision
also
for
we
say
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
abraham
for
righteousness
4
10
how
was
it
then
reckoned
when
he
was
in
circumcision
or
in
uncircumcision
not
in
circumcision
but
in
uncircumcision
4
11
and
he
received
the
sign
of
circumcision
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
of
the
faith
which
he
had
yet
being
uncircumcised
that
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
them
that
believe
though
they
be
not
circumcised
that
righteousness
might
be
imputed
unto
them
also
4
12
and
the
father
of
circumcision
to
them
who
are
not
of
the
circumcision
only
but
who
also
walk
in
the
steps
of
that
faith
of
our
father
abraham
which
he
had
being
yet
uncircumcised
4
13
for
the
promise
that
he
should
be
the
heir
of
the
world
was
not
to
abraham
or
to
his
seed
through
the
law
but
through
the
righteousness
of
faith
4
14
for
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
be
heirs
faith
is
made
void
and
the
promise
made
of
none
effect
4
15
because
the
law
worketh
wrath
for
where
no
law
is
there
is
no
transgression
4
16
therefore
it
is
of
faith
that
it
might
be
by
grace
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
seed
not
to
that
only
which
is
of
the
law
but
to
that
also
which
is
of
the
faith
of
abraham
who
is
the
father
of
us
all
4
17
(as
it
is
written
i
have
made
thee
a
father
of
many
nations
)
before
him
whom
he
believed
even
god
who
quickeneth
the
dead
and
calleth
those
things
which
be
not
as
though
they
were
4
18
who
against
hope
believed
in
hope
that
he
might
become
the
father
of
many
nations
according
to
that
which
was
spoken
so
shall
thy
seed
be
4
19
and
being
not
weak
in
faith
he
considered
not
his
own
body
now
dead
when
he
was
about
an
hundred
years
old
neither
yet
the
deadness
of
sarah’s
womb
4
20
he
staggered
not
at
the
promise
of
god
through
unbelief
but
was
strong
in
faith
giving
glory
to
god
4
21
and
being
fully
persuaded
that
what
he
had
promised
he
was
able
also
to
perform
4
22
and
therefore
it
was
imputed
to
him
for
righteousness
4
23
now
it
was
not
written
for
his
sake
alone
that
it
was
imputed
to
him
4
24
but
for
us
also
to
whom
it
shall
be
imputed
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
jesus
our
lord
from
the
dead
4
25
who
was
delivered
for
our
offences
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification
5
1
therefore
being
justified
by
faith
we
have
peace
with
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
5
2
by
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
stand
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
god
5
3
and
not
only
so
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
also
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
patience
5
4
and
patience
experience
and
experience
hope
5
5
and
hope
maketh
not
ashamed
because
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
which
is
given
unto
us
5
6
for
when
we
were
yet
without
strength
in
due
time
christ
died
for
the
ungodly
5
7
for
scarcely
for
a
righteous
man
will
one
die
yet
peradventure
for
a
good
man
some
would
even
dare
to
die
5
8
but
god
commendeth
his
love
toward
us
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
us
5
9
much
more
then
being
now
justified
by
his
blood
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
him
5
10
for
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
death
of
his
son
much
more
being
reconciled
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
life
5
11
and
not
only
so
but
we
also
joy
in
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
atonement
5
12
wherefore
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
by
sin
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men
for
that
all
have
sinned
5
13
(for
until
the
law
sin
was
in
the
world
but
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
law
5
14
nevertheless
death
reigned
from
adam
to
moses
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
adam’s
transgression
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
come
5
15
but
not
as
the
offence
so
also
is
the
free
gift
for
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
dead
much
more
the
grace
of
god
and
the
gift
by
grace
which
is
by
one
man
jesus
christ
hath
abounded
unto
many
5
16
and
not
as
it
was
by
one
that
sinned
so
is
the
gift
for
the
judgment
was
by
one
to
condemnation
but
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
justification
5
17
for
if
by
one
man’s
offence
death
reigned
by
one
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
one
jesus
christ
)
5
18
therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
condemnation
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
life
5
19
for
as
by
one
man’s
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
righteous
5
20
moreover
the
law
entered
that
the
offence
might
abound
but
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
much
more
abound
5
21
that
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
death
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
jesus
christ
our
lord
6
1
what
shall
we
say
then
shall
we
continue
in
sin
that
grace
may
abound
6
2
god
forbid
how
shall
we
that
are
dead
to
sin
live
any
longer
therein
6
3
know
ye
not
that
so
many
of
us
as
were
baptized
into
jesus
christ
were
baptized
into
his
death
6
4
therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
death
that
like
as
christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
father
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
life
6
5
for
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection
6
6
knowing
this
that
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
him
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
destroyed
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
sin
6
7
for
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
sin
6
8
now
if
we
be
dead
with
christ
we
believe
that
we
shall
also
live
with
him
6
9
knowing
that
christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
more
death
hath
no
more
dominion
over
him
6
10
for
in
that
he
died
he
died
unto
sin
once
but
in
that
he
liveth
he
liveth
unto
god
6
11
likewise
reckon
ye
also
yourselves
to
be
dead
indeed
unto
sin
but
alive
unto
god
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
6
12
let
not
sin
therefore
reign
in
your
mortal
body
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
thereof
6
13
neither
yield
ye
your
members
as
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
sin
but
yield
yourselves
unto
god
as
those
that
are
alive
from
the
dead
and
your
members
as
instruments
of
righteousness
unto
god
6
14
for
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
you
for
ye
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
grace
6
15
what
then
shall
we
sin
because
we
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
grace
god
forbid
6
16
know
ye
not
that
to
whom
ye
yield
yourselves
servants
to
obey
his
servants
ye
are
to
whom
ye
obey
whether
of
sin
unto
death
or
of
obedience
unto
righteousness
6
17
but
god
be
thanked
that
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin
but
ye
have
obeyed
from
the
heart
that
form
of
doctrine
which
was
delivered
you
6
18
being
then
made
free
from
sin
ye
became
the
servants
of
righteousness
6
19
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
because
of
the
infirmity
of
your
flesh
for
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
uncleanness
and
to
iniquity
unto
iniquity
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
holiness
6
20
for
when
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin
ye
were
free
from
righteousness
6
21
what
fruit
had
ye
then
in
those
things
whereof
ye
are
now
ashamed
for
the
end
of
those
things
is
death
6
22
but
now
being
made
free
from
sin
and
become
servants
to
god
ye
have
your
fruit
unto
holiness
and
the
end
everlasting
life
6
23
for
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
but
the
gift
of
god
is
eternal
life
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
7
1
know
ye
not
brethren
(for
i
speak
to
them
that
know
the
law
)
how
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
liveth
7
2
for
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
is
bound
by
the
law
to
her
husband
so
long
as
he
liveth
but
if
the
husband
be
dead
she
is
loosed
from
the
law
of
her
husband
7
3
so
then
if
while
her
husband
liveth
she
be
married
to
another
man
she
shall
be
called
an
adulteress
but
if
her
husband
be
dead
she
is
free
from
that
law
so
that
she
is
no
adulteress
though
she
be
married
to
another
man
7
4
wherefore
my
brethren
ye
also
are
become
dead
to
the
law
by
the
body
of
christ
that
ye
should
be
married
to
another
even
to
him
who
is
raised
from
the
dead
that
we
should
bring
forth
fruit
unto
god
7
5
for
when
we
were
in
the
flesh
the
motions
of
sins
which
were
by
the
law
did
work
in
our
members
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
death
7
6
but
now
we
are
delivered
from
the
law
that
being
dead
wherein
we
were
held
that
we
should
serve
in
newness
of
spirit
and
not
in
the
oldness
of
the
letter
7
7
what
shall
we
say
then
is
the
law
sin
god
forbid
nay
i
had
not
known
sin
but
by
the
law
for
i
had
not
known
lust
except
the
law
had
said
thou
shalt
not
covet
7
8
but
sin
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment
wrought
in
me
all
manner
of
concupiscence
for
without
the
law
sin
was
dead
7
9
for
i
was
alive
without
the
law
once
but
when
the
commandment
came
sin
revived
and
i
died
7
10
and
the
commandment
which
was
ordained
to
life
i
found
to
be
unto
death
7
11
for
sin
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment
deceived
me
and
by
it
slew
me
7
12
wherefore
the
law
is
holy
and
the
commandment
holy
and
just
and
good
7
13
was
then
that
which
is
good
made
death
unto
me
god
forbid
but
sin
that
it
might
appear
sin
working
death
in
me
by
that
which
is
good
that
sin
by
the
commandment
might
become
exceeding
sinful
7
14
for
we
know
that
the
law
is
spiritual
but
i
am
carnal
sold
under
sin
7
15
for
that
which
i
do
i
allow
not
for
what
i
would
that
do
i
not
but
what
i
hate
that
do
i
7
16
if
then
i
do
that
which
i
would
not
i
consent
unto
the
law
that
it
is
good
7
17
now
then
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
it
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me
7
18
for
i
know
that
in
me
(that
is
in
my
flesh
)
dwelleth
no
good
thing
for
to
will
is
present
with
me
but
how
to
perform
that
which
is
good
i
find
not
7
19
for
the
good
that
i
would
i
do
not
but
the
evil
which
i
would
not
that
i
do
7
20
now
if
i
do
that
i
would
not
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
it
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me
7
21
i
find
then
a
law
that
when
i
would
do
good
evil
is
present
with
me
7
22
for
i
delight
in
the
law
of
god
after
the
inward
man
7
23
but
i
see
another
law
in
my
members
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
which
is
in
my
members
7
24
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
7
25
i
thank
god
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
so
then
with
the
mind
i
myself
serve
the
law
of
god
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
sin
8
1
there
is
therefore
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
christ
jesus
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
8
2
for
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
in
christ
jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
death
8
3
for
what
the
law
could
not
do
in
that
it
was
weak
through
the
flesh
god
sending
his
own
son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
in
the
flesh
8
4
that
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
us
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
8
5
for
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
do
mind
the
things
of
the
flesh
but
they
that
are
after
the
spirit
the
things
of
the
spirit
8
6
for
to
be
carnally
minded
is
death
but
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
and
peace
8
7
because
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
god
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
god
neither
indeed
can
be
8
8
so
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
cannot
please
god
8
9
but
ye
are
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
if
so
be
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwell
in
you
now
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
8
10
and
if
christ
be
in
you
the
body
is
dead
because
of
sin
but
the
spirit
is
life
because
of
righteousness
8
11
but
if
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
you
he
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
you
8
12
therefore
brethren
we
are
debtors
not
to
the
flesh
to
live
after
the
flesh
8
13
for
if
ye
live
after
the
flesh
ye
shall
die
but
if
ye
through
the
spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
body
ye
shall
live
8
14
for
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
they
are
the
sons
of
god
8
15
for
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
fear
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
we
cry
abba
father
8
16
the
spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit
that
we
are
the
children
of
god
8
17
and
if
children
then
heirs
heirs
of
god
and
joint-heirs
with
christ
if
so
be
that
we
suffer
with
him
that
we
may
be
also
glorified
together
8
18
for
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
us
8
19
for
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
8
20
for
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
vanity
not
willingly
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
the
same
in
hope
8
21
because
the
creature
itself
also
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
8
22
for
we
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
now
8
23
and
not
only
they
but
ourselves
also
which
have
the
firstfruits
of
the
spirit
even
we
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves
waiting
for
the
adoption
to
wit
the
redemption
of
our
body
8
24
for
we
are
saved
by
hope
but
hope
that
is
seen
is
not
hope
for
what
a
man
seeth
why
doth
he
yet
hope
for
8
25
but
if
we
hope
for
that
we
see
not
then
do
we
with
patience
wait
for
it
8
26
likewise
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
cannot
be
uttered
8
27
and
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
spirit
because
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
god
8
28
and
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
to
them
who
are
the
called
according
to
his
purpose
8
29
for
whom
he
did
foreknow
he
also
did
predestinate
to
be
conformed
to
the
image
of
his
son
that
he
might
be
the
firstborn
among
many
brethren
8
30
moreover
whom
he
did
predestinate
them
he
also
called
and
whom
he
called
them
he
also
justified
and
whom
he
justified
them
he
also
glorified
8
31
what
shall
we
then
say
to
these
things
if
god
be
for
us
who
can
be
against
us
8
32
he
that
spared
not
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all
how
shall
he
not
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
things
8
33
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god’s
elect
it
is
god
that
justifieth
8
34
who
is
he
that
condemneth
it
is
christ
that
died
yea
rather
that
is
risen
again
who
is
even
at
the
right
hand
of
god
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
us
8
35
who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
christ
shall
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
peril
or
sword
8
36
as
it
is
written
for
thy
sake
we
are
killed
all
the
day
long
we
are
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
8
37
nay
in
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us
8
38
for
i
am
persuaded
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
powers
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
8
39
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creature
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
9
1
i
say
the
truth
in
christ
i
lie
not
my
conscience
also
bearing
me
witness
in
the
holy
ghost
9
2
that
i
have
great
heaviness
and
continual
sorrow
in
my
heart
9
3
for
i
could
wish
that
myself
were
accursed
from
christ
for
my
brethren
my
kinsmen
according
to
the
flesh
9
4
who
are
israelites
to
whom
pertaineth
the
adoption
and
the
glory
and
the
covenants
and
the
giving
of
the
law
and
the
service
of
god
and
the
promises
9
5
whose
are
the
fathers
and
of
whom
as
concerning
the
flesh
christ
came
who
is
over
all
god
blessed
for
ever
amen
9
6
not
as
though
the
word
of
god
hath
taken
none
effect
for
they
are
not
all
israel
which
are
of
israel
9
7
neither
because
they
are
the
seed
of
abraham
are
they
all
children
but
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
9
8
that
is
they
which
are
the
children
of
the
flesh
these
are
not
the
children
of
god
but
the
children
of
the
promise
are
counted
for
the
seed
9
9
for
this
is
the
word
of
promise
at
this
time
will
i
come
and
sarah
shall
have
a
son
9
10
and
not
only
this
but
when
rebecca
also
had
conceived
by
one
even
by
our
father
isaac
9
11
(for
the
children
being
not
yet
born
neither
having
done
any
good
or
evil
that
the
purpose
of
god
according
to
election
might
stand
not
of
works
but
of
him
that
calleth
)
9
12
it
was
said
unto
her
the
elder
shall
serve
the
younger
9
13
as
it
is
written
jacob
have
i
loved
but
esau
have
i
hated
9
14
what
shall
we
say
then
is
there
unrighteousness
with
god
god
forbid
9
15
for
he
saith
to
moses
i
will
have
mercy
on
whom
i
will
have
mercy
and
i
will
have
compassion
on
whom
i
will
have
compassion
9
16
so
then
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
god
that
sheweth
mercy
9
17
for
the
scripture
saith
unto
pharaoh
even
for
this
same
purpose
have
i
raised
thee
up
that
i
might
shew
my
power
in
thee
and
that
my
name
might
be
declared
throughout
all
the
earth
9
18
therefore
hath
he
mercy
on
whom
he
will
have
mercy
and
whom
he
will
he
hardeneth
9
19
thou
wilt
say
then
unto
me
why
doth
he
yet
find
fault
for
who
hath
resisted
his
will
9
20
nay
but
o
man
who
art
thou
that
repliest
against
god
shall
the
thing
formed
say
to
him
that
formed
it
why
hast
thou
made
me
thus
9
21
hath
not
the
potter
power
over
the
clay
of
the
same
lump
to
make
one
vessel
unto
honour
and
another
unto
dishonour
9
22
what
if
god
willing
to
shew
his
wrath
and
to
make
his
power
known
endured
with
much
longsuffering
the
vessels
of
wrath
fitted
to
destruction
9
23
and
that
he
might
make
known
the
riches
of
his
glory
on
the
vessels
of
mercy
which
he
had
afore
prepared
unto
glory
9
24
even
us
whom
he
hath
called
not
of
the
jews
only
but
also
of
the
gentiles
9
25
as
he
saith
also
in
osee
i
will
call
them
my
people
which
were
not
my
people
and
her
beloved
which
was
not
beloved
9
26
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them
ye
are
not
my
people
there
shall
they
be
called
the
children
of
the
living
god
9
27
esaias
also
crieth
concerning
israel
though
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
a
remnant
shall
be
saved
9
28
for
he
will
finish
the
work
and
cut
it
short
in
righteousness
because
a
short
work
will
the
lord
make
upon
the
earth
9
29
and
as
esaias
said
before
except
the
lord
of
sabaoth
had
left
us
a
seed
we
had
been
as
sodoma
and
been
made
like
unto
gomorrha
9
30
what
shall
we
say
then
that
the
gentiles
which
followed
not
after
righteousness
have
attained
to
righteousness
even
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
9
31
but
israel
which
followed
after
the
law
of
righteousness
hath
not
attained
to
the
law
of
righteousness
9
32
wherefore
because
they
sought
it
not
by
faith
but
as
it
were
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
they
stumbled
at
that
stumblingstone
9
33
as
it
is
written
behold
i
lay
in
sion
a
stumblingstone
and
rock
of
offence
and
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
10
1
brethren
my
heart’s
desire
and
prayer
to
god
for
israel
is
that
they
might
be
saved
10
2
for
i
bear
them
record
that
they
have
a
zeal
of
god
but
not
according
to
knowledge
10
3
for
they
being
ignorant
of
god’s
righteousness
and
going
about
to
establish
their
own
righteousness
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
god
10
4
for
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
10
5
for
moses
describeth
the
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
that
the
man
which
doeth
those
things
shall
live
by
them
10
6
but
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
speaketh
on
this
wise
say
not
in
thine
heart
who
shall
ascend
into
heaven
(that
is
to
bring
christ
down
from
above
)
10
7
or
who
shall
descend
into
the
deep
(that
is
to
bring
up
christ
again
from
the
dead
)
10
8
but
what
saith
it
the
word
is
nigh
thee
even
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
is
the
word
of
faith
which
we
preach
10
9
that
if
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
the
lord
jesus
and
shalt
believe
in
thine
heart
that
god
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
thou
shalt
be
saved
10
10
for
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
righteousness
and
with
the
mouth
confession
is
made
unto
salvation
10
11
for
the
scripture
saith
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
10
12
for
there
is
no
difference
between
the
jew
and
the
greek
for
the
same
lord
over
all
is
rich
unto
all
that
call
upon
him
10
13
for
whosoever
shall
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
saved
10
14
how
then
shall
they
call
on
him
in
whom
they
have
not
believed
and
how
shall
they
believe
in
him
of
whom
they
have
not
heard
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
preacher
10
15
and
how
shall
they
preach
except
they
be
sent
as
it
is
written
how
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
them
that
preach
the
gospel
of
peace
and
bring
glad
tidings
of
good
things
10
16
but
they
have
not
all
obeyed
the
gospel
for
esaias
saith
lord
who
hath
believed
our
report
10
17
so
then
faith
cometh
by
hearing
and
hearing
by
the
word
of
god
10
18
but
i
say
have
they
not
heard
yes
verily
their
sound
went
into
all
the
earth
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
world
10
19
but
i
say
did
not
israel
know
first
moses
saith
i
will
provoke
you
to
jealousy
by
them
that
are
no
people
and
by
a
foolish
nation
i
will
anger
you
10
20
but
esaias
is
very
bold
and
saith
i
was
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not
i
was
made
manifest
unto
them
that
asked
not
after
me
10
21
but
to
israel
he
saith
all
day
long
i
have
stretched
forth
my
hands
unto
a
disobedient
and
gainsaying
people
11
1
i
say
then
hath
god
cast
away
his
people
god
forbid
for
i
also
am
an
israelite
of
the
seed
of
abraham
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
11
2
god
hath
not
cast
away
his
people
which
he
foreknew
wot
ye
not
what
the
scripture
saith
of
elias
how
he
maketh
intercession
to
god
against
israel
saying
11
3
lord
they
have
killed
thy
prophets
and
digged
down
thine
altars
and
i
am
left
alone
and
they
seek
my
life
11
4
but
what
saith
the
answer
of
god
unto
him
i
have
reserved
to
myself
seven
thousand
men
who
have
not
bowed
the
knee
to
the
image
of
baal
11
5
even
so
then
at
this
present
time
also
there
is
a
remnant
according
to
the
election
of
grace
11
6
and
if
by
grace
then
is
it
no
more
of
works
otherwise
grace
is
no
more
grace
but
if
it
be
of
works
then
it
is
no
more
grace
otherwise
work
is
no
more
work
11
7
what
then
israel
hath
not
obtained
that
which
he
seeketh
for
but
the
election
hath
obtained
it
and
the
rest
were
blinded
11
8
(according
as
it
is
written
god
hath
given
them
the
spirit
of
slumber
eyes
that
they
should
not
see
and
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
)
unto
this
day
11
9
and
david
saith
let
their
table
be
made
a
snare
and
a
trap
and
a
stumblingblock
and
a
recompence
unto
them
11
10
let
their
eyes
be
darkened
that
they
may
not
see
and
bow
down
their
back
alway
11
11
i
say
then
have
they
stumbled
that
they
should
fall
god
forbid
but
rather
through
their
fall
salvation
is
come
unto
the
gentiles
for
to
provoke
them
to
jealousy
11
12
now
if
the
fall
of
them
be
the
riches
of
the
world
and
the
diminishing
of
them
the
riches
of
the
gentiles
how
much
more
their
fulness
11
13
for
i
speak
to
you
gentiles
inasmuch
as
i
am
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
i
magnify
mine
office
11
14
if
by
any
means
i
may
provoke
to
emulation
them
which
are
my
flesh
and
might
save
some
of
them
11
15
for
if
the
casting
away
of
them
be
the
reconciling
of
the
world
what
shall
the
receiving
of
them
be
but
life
from
the
dead
11
16
for
if
the
firstfruit
be
holy
the
lump
is
also
holy
and
if
the
root
be
holy
so
are
the
branches
11
17
and
if
some
of
the
branches
be
broken
off
and
thou
being
a
wild
olive
tree
wert
graffed
in
among
them
and
with
them
partakest
of
the
root
and
fatness
of
the
olive
tree
11
18
boast
not
against
the
branches
but
if
thou
boast
thou
bearest
not
the
root
but
the
root
thee
11
19
thou
wilt
say
then
the
branches
were
broken
off
that
i
might
be
graffed
in
11
20
well
because
of
unbelief
they
were
broken
off
and
thou
standest
by
faith
be
not
highminded
but
fear
11
21
for
if
god
spared
not
the
natural
branches
take
heed
lest
he
also
spare
not
thee
11
22
behold
therefore
the
goodness
and
severity
of
god
on
them
which
fell
severity
but
toward
thee
goodness
if
thou
continue
in
his
goodness
otherwise
thou
also
shalt
be
cut
off
11
23
and
they
also
if
they
abide
not
still
in
unbelief
shall
be
graffed
in
for
god
is
able
to
graff
them
in
again
11
24
for
if
thou
wert
cut
out
of
the
olive
tree
which
is
wild
by
nature
and
wert
graffed
contrary
to
nature
into
a
good
olive
tree
how
much
more
shall
these
which
be
the
natural
branches
be
graffed
into
their
own
olive
tree
11
25
for
i
would
not
brethren
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
this
mystery
lest
ye
should
be
wise
in
your
own
conceits
that
blindness
in
part
is
happened
to
israel
until
the
fulness
of
the
gentiles
be
come
in
11
26
and
so
all
israel
shall
be
saved
as
it
is
written
there
shall
come
out
of
sion
the
deliverer
and
shall
turn
away
ungodliness
from
jacob
11
27
for
this
is
my
covenant
unto
them
when
i
shall
take
away
their
sins
11
28
as
concerning
the
gospel
they
are
enemies
for
your
sakes
but
as
touching
the
election
they
are
beloved
for
the
father’s
sakes
11
29
for
the
gifts
and
calling
of
god
are
without
repentance
11
30
for
as
ye
in
times
past
have
not
believed
god
yet
have
now
obtained
mercy
through
their
unbelief
11
31
even
so
have
these
also
now
not
believed
that
through
your
mercy
they
also
may
obtain
mercy
11
32
for
god
hath
concluded
them
all
in
unbelief
that
he
might
have
mercy
upon
all
11
33
o
the
depth
of
the
riches
both
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgments
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
11
34
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor
11
35
or
who
hath
first
given
to
him
and
it
shall
be
recompensed
unto
him
again
11
36
for
of
him
and
through
him
and
to
him
are
all
things
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
amen
12
1
i
beseech
you
therefore
brethren
by
the
mercies
of
god
that
ye
present
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
acceptable
unto
god
which
is
your
reasonable
service
12
2
and
be
not
conformed
to
this
world
but
be
ye
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
your
mind
that
ye
may
prove
what
is
that
good
and
acceptable
and
perfect
will
of
god
12
3
for
i
say
through
the
grace
given
unto
me
to
every
man
that
is
among
you
not
to
think
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
ought
to
think
but
to
think
soberly
according
as
god
hath
dealt
to
every
man
the
measure
of
faith
12
4
for
as
we
have
many
members
in
one
body
and
all
members
have
not
the
same
office
12
5
so
we
being
many
are
one
body
in
christ
and
every
one
members
one
of
another
12
6
having
then
gifts
differing
according
to
the
grace
that
is
given
to
us
whether
prophecy
let
us
prophesy
according
to
the
proportion
of
faith
12
7
or
ministry
let
us
wait
on
our
ministering
or
he
that
teacheth
on
teaching
12
8
or
he
that
exhorteth
on
exhortation
he
that
giveth
let
him
do
it
with
simplicity
he
that
ruleth
with
diligence
he
that
sheweth
mercy
with
cheerfulness
12
9
let
love
be
without
dissimulation
abhor
that
which
is
evil
cleave
to
that
which
is
good
12
10
be
kindly
affectioned

to
another
with
brotherly
love
in
honour
preferring

another
12
11

of
fire
on
his
head
12
21
be
not
overcome
of
evil
but
overcome
evil
with
good
13
1
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
13
2
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
they
that
resist
shall
receive
to
themselves
damnation
13
3
for
rulers
are
not
a
terror
to
good
works
but
to
the
evil
wilt
thou
then
not
be
afraid
of
the
power
do
that
which
is
good
and
thou
shalt
have
praise
of
the
same
13
4
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
to
thee
for
good
but
if
thou
do
that
which
is
evil
be
afraid
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
a
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil
13
5
wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject
not
only
for
wrath
but
also
for
conscience
sake
13
6
for
for
this
cause
pay
ye
tribute
also
for
they
are
god’s
ministers
attending
continually
upon
this
very
thing
13
7
render
therefore
to
all
their
dues
tribute
to
whom
tribute
is
due
custom
to
whom
custom
fear
to
whom
fear
honour
to
whom
honour
13
8
owe
no
man
any
thing
but
to
love
one
another
for
he
that
loveth
another
hath
fulfilled
the
law
13
9
for
this
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
thou
shalt
not
covet
and
if
there
be
any
other
commandment
it
is
briefly
comprehended
in
this
saying
namely
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
13
10
love
worketh
no
ill
to
his
neighbour
therefore
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
13
11
and
that
knowing
the
time
that
now
it
is
high
time
to
awake
out
of
sleep
for
now
is
our
salvation
nearer
than
when
we
believed
13
12
the
night
is
far
spent
the
day
is
at
hand
let
us
therefore
cast
off
the
works
of
darkness
and
let
us
put
on
the
armour
of
light
13
13
let
us
walk
honestly
as
in
the
day
not
in
rioting
and
drunkenness
not
in
chambering
and
wantonness
not
in
strife
and
envying
13
14
but
put
ye
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh
to
fulfil
the
lusts
thereof
14
1
him
that
is
weak
in
the
faith
receive
ye
but
not
to
doubtful
disputations
14
2
for
one
believeth
that
he
may
eat
all
things
another
who
is
weak
eateth
herbs
14
3
let
not
him
that
eateth
despise
him
that
eateth
not
and
let
not
him
which
eateth
not
judge
him
that
eateth
for
god
hath
received
him
14
4
who
art
thou
that
judgest
another
man’s
servant
to
his
own
master
he
standeth
or
falleth
yea
he
shall
be
holden
up
for
god
is
able
to
make
him
stand
14
5
one
man
esteemeth
one
day
above
another
another
esteemeth
every
day
alike
let
every
man
be
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
14
6
he
that
regardeth
the
day
regardeth
it
unto
the
lord
and
he
that
regardeth
not
the
day
to
the
lord
he
doth
not
regard
it
he
that
eateth
eateth
to
the
lord
for
he
giveth
god
thanks
and
he
that
eateth
not
to
the
lord
he
eateth
not
and
giveth
god
thanks
14
7
for
none
of
us
liveth
to
himself
and
no
man
dieth
to
himself
14
8
for
whether
we
live
we
live
unto
the
lord
and
whether
we
die
we
die
unto
the
lord
whether
we
live
therefore
or
die
we
are
the
lord’s
14
9
for
to
this
end
christ
both
died
and
rose
and
revived
that
he
might
be
lord
both
of
the
dead
and
living
14
10
but
why
dost
thou
judge
thy
brother
or
why
dost
thou
set
at
nought
thy
brother
for
we
shall
all
stand
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
14
11
for
it
is
written
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
god
14
12
so
then
every
one
of
us
shall
give
account
of
himself
to
god
14
13
let
us
not
therefore
judge
one
another
any
more
but
judge
this
rather
that
no
man
put
a
stumblingblock
or
an
occasion
to
fall
in
his
brother’s
way
14
14
i
know
and
am
persuaded
by
the
lord
jesus
that
there
is
nothing
unclean
of
itself
but
to
him
that
esteemeth
any
thing
to
be
unclean
to
him
it
is
unclean
14
15
but
if
thy
brother
be
grieved
with
thy
meat
now
walkest
thou
not
charitably
destroy
not
him
with
thy
meat
for
whom
christ
died
14
16
let
not
then
your
good
be
evil
spoken
of
14
17
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
meat
and
drink
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
14
18
for
he
that
in
these
things
serveth
christ
is
acceptable
to
god
and
approved
of
men
14
19
let
us
therefore
follow
after
the
things
which
make
for
peace
and
things
wherewith
one
may
edify
another
14
20
for
meat
destroy
not
the
work
of
god
all
things
indeed
are
pure
but
it
is
evil
for
that
man
who
eateth
with
offence
14
21
it
is
good
neither
to
eat
flesh
nor
to
drink
wine
nor
any
thing
whereby
thy
brother
stumbleth
or
is
offended
or
is
made
weak
14
22
hast
thou
faith
have
it
to
thyself
before
god
happy
is
he
that
condemneth
not
himself
in
that
thing
which
he
alloweth
14
23
and
he
that
doubteth
is
damned
if
he
eat
because
he
eateth
not
of
faith
for
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
15
1
we
then
that
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
the
weak
and
not
to
please
ourselves
15
2
let
every
one
of
us
please
his
neighbour
for
his
good
to
edification
15
3
for
even
christ
pleased
not
himself
but
as
it
is
written
the
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
fell
on
me
15
4
for
whatsoever
things
were
written
aforetime
were
written
for
our
learning
that
we
through
patience
and
comfort
of
the
scriptures
might
have
hope
15
5
now
the
god
of
patience
and
consolation
grant
you
to
be
likeminded
one
toward
another
according
to
christ
jesus
15
6
that
ye
may
with
one
mind
and
one
mouth
glorify
god
even
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
15
7
wherefore
receive
ye
one
another
as
christ
also
received
us
to
the
glory
of
god
15
8
now
i
say
that
jesus
christ
was
a
minister
of
the
circumcision
for
the
truth
of
god
to
confirm
the
promises
made
unto
the
fathers
15
9
and
that
the
gentiles
might
glorify
god
for
his
mercy
as
it
is
written
for
this
cause
i
will
confess
to
thee
among
the
gentiles
and
sing
unto
thy
name
15
10
and
again
he
saith
rejoice
ye
gentiles
with
his
people
15
11
and
again
praise
the
lord
all
ye
gentiles
and
laud
him
all
ye
people
15
12
and
again
esaias
saith
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
and
he
that
shall
rise
to
reign
over
the
gentiles
in
him
shall
the
gentiles
trust
15
13
now
the
god
of
hope
fill
you
with
all
joy
and
peace
in
believing
that
ye
may
abound
in
hope
through
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
15
14
and
i
myself
also
am
persuaded
of
you
my
brethren
that
ye
also
are
full
of
goodness
filled
with
all
knowledge
able
also
to
admonish
one
another
15
15
nevertheless
brethren
i
have
written
the
more
boldly
unto
you
in
some
sort
as
putting
you
in
mind
because
of
the
grace
that
is
given
to
me
of
god
15
16
that
i
should
be
the
minister
of
jesus
christ
to
the
gentiles
ministering
the
gospel
of
god
that
the
offering
up
of
the
gentiles
might
be
acceptable
being
sanctified
by
the
holy
ghost
15
17
i
have
therefore
whereof
i
may
glory
through
jesus
christ
in
those
things
which
pertain
to
god
15
18
for
i
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
any
of
those
things
which
christ
hath
not
wrought
by
me
to
make
the
gentiles
obedient
by
word
and
deed
15
19
through
mighty
signs
and
wonders
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
of
god
so
that
from
jerusalem
and
round
about
unto
illyricum
i
have
fully
preached
the
gospel
of
christ
15
20
yea
so
have
i
strived
to
preach
the
gospel
not
where
christ
was
named
lest
i
should
build
upon
another
man’s
foundation
15
21
but
as
it
is
written
to
whom
he
was
not
spoken
of
they
shall
see
and
they
that
have
not
heard
shall
understand
15
22
for
which
cause
also
i
have
been
much
hindered
from
coming
to
you
15
23
but
now
having
no
more
place
in
these
parts
and
having
a
great
desire
these
many
years
to
come
unto
you
15
24
whensoever
i
take
my
journey
into
spain
i
will
come
to
you
for
i
trust
to
see
you
in
my
journey
and
to
be
brought
on
my
way
thitherward
by
you
if
first
i
be
somewhat
filled
with
your
company
15
25
but
now
i
go
unto
jerusalem
to
minister
unto
the
saints
15
26
for
it
hath
pleased
them
of
macedonia
and
achaia
to
make
a
certain
contribution
for
the
poor
saints
which
are
at
jerusalem
15
27
it
hath
pleased
them
verily
and
their
debtors
they
are
for
if
the
gentiles
have
been
made
partakers
of
their
spiritual
things
their
duty
is
also
to
minister
unto
them
in
carnal
things
15
28
when
therefore
i
have
performed
this
and
have
sealed
to
them
this
fruit
i
will
come
by
you
into
spain
15
29
and
i
am
sure
that
when
i
come
unto
you
i
shall
come
in
the
fulness
of
the
blessing
of
the
gospel
of
christ
15
30
now
i
beseech
you
brethren
for
the
lord
jesus
christ’s
sake
and
for
the
love
of
the
spirit
that
ye
strive
together
with
me
in
your
prayers
to
god
for
me
15
31
that
i
may
be
delivered
from
them
that
do
not
believe
in
judaea
and
that
my
service
which
i
have
for
jerusalem
may
be
accepted
of
the
saints
15
32
that
i
may
come
unto
you
with
joy
by
the
will
of
god
and
may
with
you
be
refreshed
15
33
now
the
god
of
peace
be
with
you
all
amen
16
1
i
commend
unto
you

our
lord
1
10
now
i
beseech
you
brethren
by
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
ye
all
speak
the
same
thing
and
that
there
be
no
divisions
among
you
but
that
ye
be
perfectly
joined
together
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
judgment
1
11
for
it
hath
been
declared
unto
me
of
you
my
brethren
by
them
which
are
of
the
house
of
chloe
that
there
are
contentions
among
you
1
12
now
this
i
say
that
every
one
of
you
saith
i
am
of
paul
and
i
of
apollos
and
i
of
cephas
and
i
of
christ
1
13
is
christ
divided
was
paul
crucified
for
you
or
were
ye
baptized
in
the
name
of
paul
1
14
i
thank
god
that
i
baptized
none
of
you
but
crispus
and
gaius
1
15
lest
any
should
say
that
i
had
baptized
in
mine
own
name
1
16
and
i
baptized
also
the
household
of
stephanas
besides
i
know
not
whether
i
baptized
any
other
1
17
for
christ
sent
me
not
to
baptize
but
to
preach
the
gospel
not
with
wisdom
of
words
lest
the
cross
of
christ
should
be
made
of
none
effect
1
18
for
the
preaching
of
the
cross
is
to
them
that
perish
foolishness
but
unto
us
which
are
saved
it
is
the
power
of
god
1
19
for
it
is
written
i
will
destroy
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
and
will
bring
to
nothing
the
understanding
of
the
prudent
1
20
where
is
the
wise
where
is
the
scribe
where
is
the
disputer
of
this
world
hath
not
god
made
foolish
the
wisdom
of
this
world
1
21
for
after
that
in
the
wisdom
of
god
the
world
by
wisdom
knew
not
god
it
pleased
god
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
believe
1
22
for
the
jews
require
a
sign
and
the
greeks
seek
after
wisdom
1
23
but
we
preach
christ
crucified
unto
the
jews
a
stumblingblock
and
unto
the
greeks
foolishness
1
24
but
unto
them
which
are
called
both
jews
and
greeks
christ
the
power
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
1
25
because
the
foolishness
of
god
is
wiser
than
men
and
the
weakness
of
god
is
stronger
than
men
1
26
for
ye
see
your
calling
brethren
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
flesh
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
are
called
1
27
but
god
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
wise
and
god
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
1
28
and
base
things
of
the
world
and
things
which
are
despised
hath
god
chosen
yea
and
things
which
are
not
to
bring
to
nought
things
that
are
1
29
that
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
presence
1
30
but
of
him
are
ye
in
christ
jesus
who
of
god
is
made
unto
us
wisdom
and
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
redemption
1
31
that
according
as
it
is
written
he
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
in
the
lord
2
1
and
i
brethren
when
i
came
to
you
came
not
with
excellency
of
speech
or
of
wisdom
declaring
unto
you
the
testimony
of
god
2
2
for
i
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
you
save
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
2
3
and
i
was
with
you
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
in
much
trembling
2
4
and
my
speech
and
my
preaching
was
not
with
enticing
words
of
man’s
wisdom
but
in
demonstration
of
the
spirit
and
of
power
2
5
that
your
faith
should
not
stand
in
the
wisdom
of
men
but
in
the
power
of
god
2
6
howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
perfect
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
world
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
world
that
come
to
nought
2
7
but
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
god
in
a
mystery
even
the
hidden
wisdom
which
god
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
glory
2
8
which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
knew
for
had
they
known
it
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
2
9
but
as
it
is
written
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
2
10
but
god
hath
revealed
them
unto
us
by
his
spirit
for
the
spirit
searcheth
all
things
yea
the
deep
things
of
god
2
11
for
what
man
knoweth
the
things
of
a
man
save
the
spirit
of
man
which
is
in
him
even
so
the
things
of
god
knoweth
no
man
but
the
spirit
of
god
2
12
now
we
have
received
not
the
spirit
of
the
world
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
god
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
god
2
13
which
things
also
we
speak
not
in
the
words
which
man’s
wisdom
teacheth
but
which
the
holy
ghost
teacheth
comparing
spiritual
things
with
spiritual
2
14
but
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
neither
can
he
know
them
because
they
are
spiritually
discerned
2
15
but
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
things
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
man
2
16
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
that
he
may
instruct
him
but
we
have
the
mind
of
christ
3
1
and
i
brethren
could
not
speak
unto
you
as
unto
spiritual
but
as
unto
carnal
even
as
unto
babes
in
christ
3
2
i
have
fed
you
with
milk
and
not
with
meat
for
hitherto
ye
were
not
able
to
bear
it
neither
yet
now
are
ye
able
3
3
for
ye
are
yet
carnal
for
whereas
there
is
among
you
envying
and
strife
and
divisions
are
ye
not
carnal
and
walk
as
men
3
4
for
while
one
saith
i
am
of
paul
and
another
i
am
of
apollos
are
ye
not
carnal
3
5
who
then
is
paul
and
who
is
apollos
but
ministers
by
whom
ye
believed
even
as
the
lord
gave
to
every
man
3
6
i
have
planted
apollos
watered
but
god
gave
the
increase
3
7
so
then
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
thing
neither
he
that
watereth
but
god
that
giveth
the
increase
3
8
now
he
that
planteth
and
he
that
watereth
are
one
and
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
labour
3
9
for
we
are
labourers
together
with
god
ye
are
god’s
husbandry
ye
are
god’s
building
3
10
according
to
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
unto
me
as
a
wise
masterbuilder
i
have
laid
the
foundation
and
another
buildeth
thereon
but
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
thereupon
3
11
for
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
is
laid
which
is
jesus
christ
3
12
now
if
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
gold
silver
precious
stones
wood
hay
stubble
3
13
every
man’s
work
shall
be
made
manifest
for
the
day
shall
declare
it
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
fire
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man’s
work
of
what
sort
it
is
3
14
if
any
man’s
work
abide
which
he
hath
built
thereupon
he
shall
receive
a
reward
3
15
if
any
man’s
work
shall
be
burned
he
shall
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
fire
3
16
know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
you
3
17
if
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
god
him
shall
god
destroy
for
the
temple
of
god
is
holy
which
temple
ye
are
3
18
let
no
man
deceive
himself
if
any
man
among
you
seemeth
to
be
wise
in
this
world
let
him
become
a
fool
that
he
may
be
wise
3
19
for
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
god
for
it
is
written
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
3
20
and
again
the
lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
that
they
are
vain
3
21
therefore
let
no
man
glory
in
men
for
all
things
are
yours
3
22
whether
paul
or
apollos
or
cephas
or
the
world
or
life
or
death
or
things
present
or
things
to
come
all
are
yours
3
23
and
ye
are
christ’s
and
christ
is
god’s
4
1
let
a
man
so
account
of
us
as
of
the
ministers
of
christ
and
stewards
of
the
mysteries
of
god
4
2
moreover
it
is
required
in
stewards
that
a
man
be
found
faithful
4
3
but
with
me
it
is
a
very
small
thing
that
i
should
be
judged
of
you
or
of
man’s
judgment
yea
i
judge
not
mine
own
self
4
4
for
i
know
nothing
by
myself
yet
am
i
not
hereby
justified
but
he
that
judgeth
me
is
the
lord
4
5
therefore
judge
nothing
before
the
time
until
the
lord
come
who
both
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
and
will
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
hearts
and
then
shall
every
man
have
praise
of
god
4
6
and
these
things
brethren
i
have
in
a
figure
transferred
to
myself
and
to
apollos
for
your
sakes
that
ye
might
learn
in
us
not
to
think
of
men
above
that
which
is
written
that
no
one
of
you
be
puffed
up
for
one
against
another
4
7
for
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
from
another
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive
now
if
thou
didst
receive
it
why
dost
thou
glory
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
it
4
8
now
ye
are
full
now
ye
are
rich
ye
have
reigned
as
kings
without
us
and
i
would
to
god
ye
did
reign
that
we
also
might
reign
with
you
4
9
for
i
think
that
god
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
last
as
it
were
appointed
to
death
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
4
10
we
are
fools
for
christ’s
sake
but
ye
are
wise
in
christ
we
are
weak
but
ye
are
strong
ye
are
honourable
but
we
are
despised
4
11
even
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
naked
and
are
buffeted
and
have
no
certain
dwellingplace
4
12
and
labour
working
with
our
own
hands
being
reviled
we
bless
being
persecuted
we
suffer
it
4
13
being
defamed
we
intreat
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
world
and
are
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
day
4
14
i
write
not
these
things
to
shame
you
but
as
my
beloved
sons
i
warn
you
4
15
for
though
ye
have
ten
thousand
instructers
in
christ
yet
have
ye
not
many
fathers
for
in
christ
jesus
i
have
begotten
you
through
the
gospel
4
16
wherefore
i
beseech
you
be
ye
followers
of
me
4
17
for
this
cause
have
i
sent
unto
you
timotheus
who
is
my
beloved
son
and
faithful
in
the
lord
who
shall
bring
you
into
remembrance
of
my
ways
which
be
in
christ
as
i
teach
every
where
in
every
church
4
18
now
some
are
puffed
up
as
though
i
would
not
come
to
you
4
19
but
i
will
come
to
you
shortly
if
the
lord
will
and
will
know
not
the
speech
of
them
which
are
puffed
up
but
the
power
4
20
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
in
word
but
in
power
4
21
what
will
ye
shall
i
come
unto
you
with
a
rod
or
in
love
and
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
5
1
it
is
reported
commonly
that
there
is
fornication
among
you
and
such
fornication
as
is
not
so
much
as
named
among
the
gentiles
that
one
should
have
his
father’s
wife
5
2
and
ye
are
puffed
up
and
have
not
rather
mourned
that
he
that
hath
done
this
deed
might
be
taken
away
from
among
you
5
3
for
i
verily
as
absent
in
body
but
present
in
spirit
have
judged
already
as
though
i
were
present
concerning
him
that
hath
so
done
this
deed
5
4
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
when
ye
are
gathered
together
and
my
spirit
with
the
power
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
5
5
to
deliver
such
an
one
unto
satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
flesh
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
lord
jesus
5
6
your
glorying
is
not
good
know
ye
not
that
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
5
7
purge
out
therefore
the
old
leaven
that
ye
may
be
a
new
lump
as
ye
are
unleavened
for
even
christ
our
passover
is
sacrificed
for
us
5
8
therefore
let
us
keep
the
feast
not
with
old
leaven
neither
with
the
leaven
of
malice
and
wickedness
but
with
the
unleavened
bread
of
sincerity
and
truth
5
9
i
wrote
unto
you
in
an
epistle
not
to
company
with
fornicators
5
10
yet
not
altogether
with
the
fornicators
of
this
world
or
with
the
covetous
or
extortioners
or
with
idolaters
for
then
must
ye
needs
go
out
of
the
world
5
11
but
now
i
have
written
unto
you
not
to
keep
company
if
any
man
that
is
called
a
brother
be
a
fornicator
or
covetous
or
an
idolater
or
a
railer
or
a
drunkard
or
an
extortioner
with
such
an
one
no
not
to
eat
5
12
for
what
have
i
to
do
to
judge
them
also
that
are
without
do
not
ye
judge
them
that
are
within
5
13
but
them
that
are
without
god
judgeth
therefore
put
away
from
among
yourselves
that
wicked
person
6
1
dare
any
of
you
having
a
matter
against
another
go
to
law
before
the
unjust
and
not
before
the
saints
6
2
do
ye
not
know
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
world
and
if
the
world
shall
be
judged
by
you
are
ye
unworthy
to
judge
the
smallest
matters
6
3
know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
angels
how
much
more
things
that
pertain
to
this
life
6
4
if
then
ye
have
judgments
of
things
pertaining
to
this
life
set
them
to
judge
who
are
least
esteemed
in
the
church
6
5
i
speak
to
your
shame
is
it
so
that
there
is
not
a
wise
man
among
you
no
not
one
that
shall
be
able
to
judge
between
his
brethren
6
6
but
brother
goeth
to
law
with
brother
and
that
before
the
unbelievers
6
7
now
therefore
there
is
utterly
a
fault
among
you
because
ye
go
to
law
one
with
another
why
do
ye
not
rather
take
wrong
why
do
ye
not
rather
suffer
yourselves
to
be
defrauded
6
8
nay
ye
do
wrong
and
defraud
and
that
your
brethren
6
9
know
ye
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
be
not
deceived
neither
fornicators
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
mankind
6
10
nor
thieves
nor
covetous
nor
drunkards
nor
revilers
nor
extortioners
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
6
11
and
such
were
some
of
you
but
ye
are
washed
but
ye
are
sanctified
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
by
the
spirit
of
our
god
6
12
all
things
are
lawful
unto
me
but
all
things
are
not
expedient
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
i
will
not
be
brought
under
the
power
of
any
6
13
meats
for
the
belly
and
the
belly
for
meats
but
god
shall
destroy
both
it
and
them
now
the
body
is
not
for
fornication
but
for
the
lord
and
the
lord
for
the
body
6
14
and
god
hath
both
raised
up
the
lord
and
will
also
raise
up
us
by
his
own
power
6
15
know
ye
not
that
your
bodies
are
the
members
of
christ
shall
i
then
take
the
members
of
christ
and
make
them
the
members
of
an
harlot
god
forbid
6
16
what
know
ye
not
that
he
which
is
joined
to
an
harlot
is
one
body
for
two
saith
he
shall
be
one
flesh
6
17
but
he
that
is
joined
unto
the
lord
is
one
spirit
6
18
flee
fornication
every
sin
that
a
man
doeth
is
without
the
body
but
he
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
body
6
19
what
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
in
you
which
ye
have
of
god
and
ye
are
not
your
own
6
20
for
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
therefore
glorify
god
in
your
body
and
in
your
spirit
which
are
god’s
7
1
now
concerning
the
things
whereof
ye
wrote
unto
me
it
is
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
7
2
nevertheless
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
husband
7
3
let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
due
benevolence
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
husband
7
4
the
wife
hath
not
power
of
her
own
body
but
the
husband
and
likewise
also
the
husband
hath
not
power
of
his
own
body
but
the
wife
7
5
defraud
ye
not
one
the
other
except
it
be
with
consent
for
a
time
that
ye
may
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
prayer
and
come
together
again
that
satan
tempt
you
not
for
your
incontinency
7
6
but
i
speak
this
by
permission
and
not
of
commandment
7
7
for
i
would
that
all
men
were
even
as
i
myself
but
every
man
hath
his
proper
gift
of
god
one
after
this
manner
and
another
after
that
7
8
i
say
therefore
to
the
unmarried
and
widows
it
is
good
for
them
if
they
abide
even
as
i
7
9
but
if
they
cannot
contain
let
them
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
burn
7
10
and
unto
the
married
i
command
yet
not
i
but
the
lord
let
not
the
wife
depart
from
her
husband
7
11
but
and
if
she
depart
let
her
remain
unmarried
or
be
reconciled
to
her
husband
and
let
not
the
husband
put
away
his
wife
7
12
but
to
the
rest
speak
i
not
the
lord
if
any
brother
hath
a
wife
that
believeth
not
and
she
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
him
let
him
not
put
her
away
7
13
and
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
that
believeth
not
and
if
he
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
her
let
her
not
leave
him
7
14
for
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
by
the
wife
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
by
the
husband
else
were
your
children
unclean
but
now
are
they
holy
7
15
but
if
the
unbelieving
depart
let
him
depart
a
brother
or
a
sister
is
not
under
bondage
in
such
cases
but
god
hath
called
us
to
peace
7
16
for
what
knowest
thou
o
wife
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
husband
or
how
knowest
thou
o
man
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
wife
7
17
but
as
god
hath
distributed
to
every
man
as
the
lord
hath
called
every
one
so
let
him
walk
and
so
ordain
i
in
all
churches
7
18
is
any
man
called
being
circumcised
let
him
not
become
uncircumcised
is
any
called
in
uncircumcision
let
him
not
be
circumcised
7
19
circumcision
is
nothing
and
uncircumcision
is
nothing
but
the
keeping
of
the
commandments
of
god
7
20
let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
was
called
7
21
art
thou
called
being
a
servant
care
not
for
it
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
free
use
it
rather
7
22
for
he
that
is
called
in
the
lord
being
a
servant
is
the
lord’s
freeman
likewise
also
he
that
is
called
being
free
is
christ’s
servant
7
23
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
men
7
24
brethren
let
every
man
wherein
he
is
called
therein
abide
with
god
7
25
now
concerning
virgins
i
have
no
commandment
of
the
lord
yet
i
give
my
judgment
as
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
of
the
lord
to
be
faithful
7
26
i
suppose
therefore
that
this
is
good
for
the
present
distress
i
say
that
it
is
good
for
a
man
so
to
be
7
27
art
thou
bound
unto
a
wife
seek
not
to
be
loosed
art
thou
loosed
from
a
wife
seek
not
a
wife
7
28
but
and
if
thou
marry
thou
hast
not
sinned
and
if
a
virgin
marry
she
hath
not
sinned
nevertheless
such
shall
have
trouble
in
the
flesh
but
i
spare
you
7
29
but
this
i
say
brethren
the
time
is
short
it
remaineth
that
both
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
none
7
30
and
they
that
weep
as
though
they
wept
not
and
they
that
rejoice
as
though
they
rejoiced
not
and
they
that
buy
as
though
they
possessed
not
7
31
and
they
that
use
this
world
as
not
abusing
it
for
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
away
7
32
but
i
would
have
you
without
carefulness
he
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
lord
how
he
may
please
the
lord
7
33
but
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
world
how
he
may
please
his
wife
7
34
there
is
difference
also
between
a
wife
and
a
virgin
the
unmarried
woman
careth
for
the
things
of
the
lord
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
but
she
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband
7
35
and
this
i
speak
for
your
own
profit
not
that
i
may
cast
a
snare
upon
you
but
for
that
which
is
comely
and
that
ye
may
attend
upon
the
lord
without
distraction
7
36
but
if
any
man
think
that
he
behaveth
himself
uncomely
toward
his
virgin
if
she
pass
the
flower
of
her
age
and
need
so
require
let
him
do
what
he
will
he
sinneth
not
let
them
marry
7
37
nevertheless
he
that
standeth
stedfast
in
his
heart
having
no
necessity
but
hath
power
over
his
own
will
and
hath
so
decreed
in
his
heart
that
he
will
keep
his
virgin
doeth
well
7
38
so
then
he
that
giveth
her
in
marriage
doeth
well
but
he
that
giveth
her
not
in
marriage
doeth
better
7
39
the
wife
is
bound
by
the
law
as
long
as
her
husband
liveth
but
if
her
husband
be
dead
she
is
at
liberty
to
be
married
to
whom
she
will
only
in
the
lord
7
40
but
she
is
happier
if
she
so
abide
after
my
judgment
and
i
think
also
that
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
8
1
now
as
touching
things
offered
unto
idols
we
know
that
we
all
have
knowledge
knowledge
puffeth
up
but
charity
edifieth
8
2
and
if
any
man
think
that
he
knoweth
any
thing
he
knoweth
nothing
yet
as
he
ought
to
know
8
3
but
if
any
man
love
god
the
same
is
known
of
him
8
4
as
concerning
therefore
the
eating
of
those
things
that
are
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothing
in
the
world
and
that
there
is
none
other
god
but
one
8
5
for
though
there
be
that
are
called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
in
earth
(as
there
be
gods
many
and
lords
many
)
8
6
but
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
of
whom
are
all
things
and
we
in
him
and
one
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
are
all
things
and
we
by
him
8
7
howbeit
there
is
not
in
every
man
that
knowledge
for
some
with
conscience
of
the
idol
unto
this
hour
eat
it
as
a
thing
offered
unto
an
idol
and
their
conscience
being
weak
is
defiled
8
8
but
meat
commendeth
us
not
to
god
for
neither
if
we
eat
are
we
the
better
neither
if
we
eat
not
are
we
the
worse
8
9
but
take
heed
lest
by
any
means
this
liberty
of
yours
become
a
stumblingblock
to
them
that
are
weak
8
10
for
if
any
man
see
thee
which
hast
knowledge
sit
at
meat
in
the
idol’s
temple
shall
not
the
conscience
of
him
which
is
weak
be
emboldened
to
eat
those
things
which
are
offered
to
idols
8
11
and
through
thy
knowledge
shall
the
weak
brother
perish
for
whom
christ
died
8
12
but
when
ye
sin
so
against
the
brethren
and
wound
their
weak
conscience
ye
sin
against
christ
8
13
wherefore
if
meat
make
my
brother
to
offend
i
will
eat
no
flesh
while
the
world
standeth
lest
i
make
my
brother
to
offend
9
1
am
i
not
an
apostle
am
i
not
free
have
i
not
seen
jesus
christ
our
lord
are
not
ye
my
work
in
the
lord
9
2
if
i
be
not
an
apostle
unto
others
yet
doubtless
i
am
to
you
for
the
seal
of
mine
apostleship
are
ye
in
the
lord
9
3
mine
answer
to
them
that
do
examine
me
is
this
9
4
have
we
not
power
to
eat
and
to
drink
9
5
have
we
not
power
to
lead
about
a
sister
a
wife
as
well
as
other
apostles
and
as
the
brethren
of
the
lord
and
cephas
9
6
or
i
only
and
barnabas
have
not
we
power
to
forbear
working
9
7
who
goeth
a
warfare
any
time
at
his
own
charges
who
planteth
a
vineyard
and
eateth
not
of
the
fruit
thereof
or
who
feedeth
a
flock
and
eateth
not
of
the
milk
of
the
flock
9
8
say
i
these
things
as
a
man
or
saith
not
the
law
the
same
also
9
9
for
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
mouth
of
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
doth
god
take
care
for
oxen
9
10
or
saith
he
it
altogether
for
our
sakes
for
our
sakes
no
doubt
this
is
written
that
he
that
ploweth
should
plow
in
hope
and
that
he
that
thresheth
in
hope
should
be
partaker
of
his
hope
9
11
if
we
have
sown
unto
you
spiritual
things
is
it
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap
your
carnal
things
9
12
if
others
be
partakers
of
this
power
over
you
are
not
we
rather
nevertheless
we
have
not
used
this
power
but
suffer
all
things
lest
we
should
hinder
the
gospel
of
christ
9
13
do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
temple
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
altar
9
14
even
so
hath
the
lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the
gospel
9
15
but
i
have
used
none
of
these
things
neither
have
i
written
these
things
that
it
should
be
so
done
unto
me
for
it
were
better
for
me
to
die
than
that
any
man
should
make
my
glorying
void
9
16
for
though
i
preach
the
gospel
i
have
nothing
to
glory
of
for
necessity
is
laid
upon
me
yea
woe
is
unto
me
if
i
preach
not
the
gospel
9
17
for
if
i
do
this
thing
willingly
i
have
a
reward
but
if
against
my
will
a
dispensation
of
the
gospel
is
committed
unto
me
9
18
what
is
my
reward
then
verily
that
when
i
preach
the
gospel
i
may
make
the
gospel
of
christ
without
charge
that
i
abuse
not
my
power
in
the
gospel
9
19
for
though
i
be
free
from
all
men
yet
have
i
made
myself
servant
unto
all
that
i
might
gain
the
more
9
20
and
unto
the
jews
i
became
as
a
jew
that
i
might
gain
the
jews
to
them
that
are
under
the
law
as
under
the
law
that
i
might
gain
them
that
are
under
the
law
9
21
to
them
that
are
without
law
as
without
law
(being
not
without
law
to
god
but
under
the
law
to
christ
)
that
i
might
gain
them
that
are
without
law
9
22
to
the
weak
became
i
as
weak
that
i
might
gain
the
weak
i
am
made
all
things
to
all
men
that
i
might
by
all
means
save
some
9
23
and
this
i
do
for
the
gospel’s
sake
that
i
might
be
partaker
thereof
with
you
9
24
know
ye
not
that
they
which
run
in
a
race
run
all
but
one
receiveth
the
prize
so
run
that
ye
may
obtain
9
25
and
every
man
that
striveth
for
the
mastery
is
temperate
in
all
things
now
they
do
it
to
obtain
a
corruptible
crown
but
we
an
incorruptible
9
26
i
therefore
so
run
not
as
uncertainly
so
fight
i
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
air
9
27
but
i
keep
under
my
body
and
bring
it
into
subjection
lest
that
by
any
means
when
i
have
preached
to
others
i
myself
should
be
a
castaway
10
1
moreover
brethren
i
would
not
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
10
2
and
were
all
baptized
unto
moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
10
3
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat
10
4
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
was
christ
10
5
but
with
many
of
them
god
was
not
well
pleased
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
wilderness
10
6
now
these
things
were
our
examples
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
things
as
they
also
lusted
10
7
neither
be
ye
idolaters
as
were
some
of
them
as
it
is
written
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
and
rose
up
to
play
10
8
neither
let
us
commit
fornication
as
some
of
them
committed
and
fell
in
one
day
three
and
twenty
thousand
10
9
neither
let
us
tempt
christ
as
some
of
them
also
tempted
and
were
destroyed
of
serpents
10
10
neither
murmur
ye
as
some
of
them
also
murmured
and
were
destroyed
of
the
destroyer
10
11
now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
ensamples
and
they
are
written
for
our
admonition
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come
10
12
wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
10
13
there
hath
no
temptation
taken
you
but
such
as
is
common
to
man
but
god
is
faithful
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempted
above
that
ye
are
able
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
escape
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
it
10
14
wherefore
my
dearly
beloved
flee
from
idolatry
10
15
i
speak
as
to
wise
men
judge
ye
what
i
say
10
16
the
cup
of
blessing
which
we
bless
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
blood
of
christ
the
bread
which
we
break
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
body
of
christ
10
17
for
we
being
many
are
one
bread
and
one
body
for
we
are
all
partakers
of
that
one
bread
10
18
behold
israel
after
the
flesh
are
not
they
which
eat
of
the
sacrifices
partakers
of
the
altar
10
19
what
say
i
then
that
the
idol
is
any
thing
or
that
which
is
offered
in
sacrifice
to
idols
is
any
thing
10
20
but
i
say
that
the
things
which
the
gentiles
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
to
devils
and
not
to
god
and
i
would
not
that
ye
should
have
fellowship
with
devils
10
21
ye
cannot
drink
the
cup
of
the
lord
and
the
cup
of
devils
ye
cannot
be
partakers
of
the
lord’s
table
and
of
the
table
of
devils
10
22
do
we
provoke
the
lord
to
jealousy
are
we
stronger
than
he
10
23
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
all
things
are
not
expedient
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
all
things
edify
not
10
24
let
no
man
seek
his
own
but
every
man
another’s
wealth
10
25
whatsoever
is
sold
in
the
shambles
that
eat
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake
10
26
for
the
earth
is
the
lord’s
and
the
fulness
thereof
10
27
if
any
of
them
that
believe
not
bid
you
to
a
feast
and
ye
be
disposed
to
go
whatsoever
is
set
before
you
eat
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake
10
28
but
if
any
man
say
unto
you
this
is
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols
eat
not
for
his
sake
that
shewed
it
and
for
conscience
sake
for
the
earth
is
the
lord’s
and
the
fulness
thereof
10
29
conscience
i
say
not
thine
own
but
of
the
other
for
why
is
my
liberty
judged
of
another
man’s
conscience
10
30
for
if
i
by
grace
be
a
partaker
why
am
i
evil
spoken
of
for
that
for
which
i
give
thanks
10
31
whether
therefore
ye
eat
or
drink
or
whatsoever
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
10
32
give
none
offence
neither
to
the
jews
nor
to
the
gentiles
nor
to
the
church
of
god
10
33
even
as
i
please
all
men
in
all
things
not
seeking
mine
own
profit
but
the
profit
of
many
that
they
may
be
saved
11
1
be
ye
followers
of
me
even
as
i
also
am
of
christ
11
2
now
i
praise
you
brethren
that
ye
remember
me
in
all
things
and
keep
the
ordinances
as
i
delivered
them
to
you
11
3
but
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
christ
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
christ
is
god
11
4
every
man
praying
or
prophesying
having
his
head
covered
dishonoureth
his
head
11
5
but
every
woman
that
prayeth
or
prophesieth
with
her
head
uncovered
dishonoureth
her
head
for
that
is
even
all
one
as
if
she
were
shaven
11
6
for
if
the
woman
be
not
covered
let
her
also
be
shorn
but
if
it
be
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
be
shorn
or
shaven
let
her
be
covered
11
7
for
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
his
head
forasmuch
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
god
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
man
11
8
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman
but
the
woman
of
the
man
11
9
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman
but
the
woman
for
the
man
11
10
for
this
cause
ought
the
woman
to
have
power
on
her
head
because
of
the
angels
11
11
nevertheless
neither
is
the
man
without
the
woman
neither
the
woman
without
the
man
in
the
lord
11
12
for
as
the
woman
is
of
the
man
even
so
is
the
man
also
by
the
woman
but
all
things
of
god
11
13
judge
in
yourselves
is
it
comely
that
a
woman
pray
unto
god
uncovered
11
14
doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
you
that
if
a
man
have
long
hair
it
is
a
shame
unto
him
11
15
but
if
a
woman
have
long
hair
it
is
a
glory
to
her
for
her
hair
is
given
her
for
a
covering
11
16
but
if
any
man
seem
to
be
contentious
we
have
no
such
custom
neither
the
churches
of
god
11
17
now
in
this
that
i
declare
unto
you
i
praise
you
not
that
ye
come
together
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
11
18
for
first
of
all
when
ye
come
together
in
the
church
i
hear
that
there
be
divisions
among
you
and
i
partly
believe
it
11
19
for
there
must
be
also
heresies
among
you
that
they
which
are
approved
may
be
made
manifest
among
you
11
20
when
ye
come
together
therefore
into
one
place
this
is
not
to
eat
the
lord’s
supper
11
21
for
in
eating
every
one
taketh
before
other
his
own
supper
and
one
is
hungry
and
another
is
drunken
11
22
what
have
ye
not
houses
to
eat
and
to
drink
in
or
despise
ye
the
church
of
god
and
shame
them
that
have
not
what
shall
i
say
to
you
shall
i
praise
you
in
this
i
praise
you
not
11
23
for
i
have
received
of
the
lord
that
which
also
i
delivered
unto
you
that
the
lord
jesus
the
same
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
bread
11
24
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
brake
it
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
which
is
broken
for
you
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
11
25
after
the
same
manner
also
he
took
the
cup
when
he
had
supped
saying
this
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood
this
do
ye
as
oft
as
ye
drink
it
in
remembrance
of
me
11
26
for
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
bread
and
drink
this
cup
ye
do
shew
the
lord’s
death
till
he
come
11
27
wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread
and
drink
this
cup
of
the
lord
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
lord
11
28
but
let
a
man
examine
himself
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
bread
and
drink
of
that
cup
11
29
for
he
that
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
himself
not
discerning
the
lord’s
body
11
30
for
this
cause
many
are
weak
and
sickly
among
you
and
many
sleep
11
31
for
if
we
would
judge
ourselves
we
should
not
be
judged
11
32
but
when
we
are
judged
we
are
chastened
of
the
lord
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
world
11
33
wherefore
my
brethren
when
ye
come
together
to
eat
tarry
one
for
another
11
34
and
if
any
man
hunger
let
him
eat
at
home
that
ye
come
not
together
unto
condemnation
and
the
rest
will
i
set
in
order
when
i
come
12
1
now
concerning
spiritual
gifts
brethren
i
would
not
have
you
ignorant
12
2
ye
know
that
ye
were
gentiles
carried
away
unto
these
dumb
idols
even
as
ye
were
led
12
3
wherefore
i
give
you
to
understand
that
no
man
speaking
by
the
spirit
of
god
calleth
jesus
accursed
and
that
no
man
can
say
that
jesus
is
the
lord
but
by
the
holy
ghost
12
4
now
there
are
diversities
of
gifts
but
the
same
spirit
12
5
and
there
are
differences
of
administrations
but
the
same
lord
12
6
and
there
are
diversities
of
operations
but
it
is
the
same
god
which
worketh
all
in
all
12
7
but
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
is
given
to
every
man
to
profit
withal
12
8
for
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
the
word
of
wisdom
to
another
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
spirit
12
9
to
another
faith
by
the
same
spirit
to
another
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
spirit
12
10
to
another
the
working
of
miracles
to
another
prophecy
to
another
discerning
of
spirits
to
another
divers
kinds
of
tongues
to
another
the
interpretation
of
tongues
12
11
but
all
these
worketh
that
one
and
the
selfsame
spirit
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
will
12
12
for
as
the
body
is
one
and
hath
many
members
and
all
the
members
of
that
one
body
being
many
are
one
body
so
also
is
christ
12
13
for
by
one
spirit
are
we
all
baptized
into
one
body
whether
we
be
jews
or
gentiles
whether
we
be
bond
or
free
and
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into
one
spirit
12
14
for
the
body
is
not
one
member
but
many
12
15
if
the
foot
shall
say
because
i
am
not
the
hand
i
am
not
of
the
body
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body
12
16
and
if
the
ear
shall
say
because
i
am
not
the
eye
i
am
not
of
the
body
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body
12
17
if
the
whole
body
were
an
eye
where
were
the
hearing
if
the
whole
were
hearing
where
were
the
smelling
12
18
but
now
hath
god
set
the
members
every
one
of
them
in
the
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
12
19
and
if
they
were
all
one
member
where
were
the
body
12
20
but
now
are
they
many
members
yet
but
one
body
12
21
and
the
eye
cannot
say
unto
the
hand
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nor
again
the
head
to
the
feet
i
have
no
need
of
you
12
22
nay
much
more
those
members
of
the
body
which
seem
to
be
more
feeble
are
necessary
12
23
and
those
members
of
the
body
which
we
think
to
be
less
honourable
upon
these
we
bestow
more
abundant
honour
and
our
uncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
comeliness
12
24
for
our
comely
parts
have
no
need
but
god
hath
tempered
the
body
together
having
given
more
abundant
honour
to
that
part
which
lacked
12
25
that
there
should
be
no
schism
in
the
body
but
that
the
members
should
have
the
same
care
one
for
another
12
26
and
whether
one
member
suffer
all
the
members
suffer
with
it
or
one
member
be
honoured
all
the
members
rejoice
with
it
12
27
now
ye
are
the
body
of
christ
and
members
in
particular
12
28
and
god
hath
set
some
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondarily
prophets
thirdly
teachers
after
that
miracles
then
gifts
of
healings
helps
governments
diversities
of
tongues
12
29
are
all
apostles
are
all
prophets
are
all
teachers
are
all
workers
of
miracles
12
30
have
all
the
gifts
of
healing
do
all
speak
with
tongues
do
all
interpret
12
31
but
covet
earnestly
the
best
gifts
and
yet
shew
i
unto
you
a
more
excellent
way
13
1
though
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
have
not
charity
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
or
a
tinkling
cymbal
13
2
and
though
i
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
understand
all
mysteries
and
all
knowledge
and
though
i
have
all
faith
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
13
3
and
though
i
bestow
all
my
goods
to
feed
the
poor
and
though
i
give
my
body
to
be
burned
and
have
not
charity
it
profiteth
me
nothing
13
4
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
charity
envieth
not
charity
vaunteth
not
itself
is
not
puffed
up
13
5
doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
13
6
rejoiceth
not
in
iniquity
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth
13
7
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
13
8
charity
never
faileth
but
whether
there
be
prophecies
they
shall
fail
whether
there
be
tongues
they
shall
cease
whether
there
be
knowledge
it
shall
vanish
away
13
9
for
we
know
in
part
and
we
prophesy
in
part
13
10
but
when
that
which
is
perfect
is
come
then
that
which
is
in
part
shall
be
done
away
13
11
when
i
was
a
child
i
spake
as
a
child
i
understood
as
a
child
i
thought
as
a
child
but
when
i
became
a
man
i
put
away
childish
things
13
12
for
now
we
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
now
i
know
in
part
but
then
shall
i
know
even
as
also
i
am
known
13
13
and
now
abideth
faith
hope
charity
these
three
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
14
1
follow
after
charity
and
desire
spiritual
gifts
but
rather
that
ye
may
prophesy
14
2
for
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
speaketh
not
unto
men
but
unto
god
for
no
man
understandeth
him
howbeit
in
the
spirit
he
speaketh
mysteries
14
3
but
he
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men
to
edification
and
exhortation
and
comfort
14
4
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
edifieth
himself
but
he
that
prophesieth
edifieth
the
church
14
5
i
would
that
ye
all
spake
with
tongues
but
rather
that
ye
prophesied
for
greater
is
he
that
prophesieth
than
he
that
speaketh
with
tongues
except
he
interpret
that
the
church
may
receive
edifying
14
6
now
brethren
if
i
come
unto
you
speaking
with
tongues
what
shall
i
profit
you
except
i
shall
speak
to
you
either
by
revelation
or
by
knowledge
or
by
prophesying
or
by
doctrine
14
7
and
even
things
without
life
giving
sound
whether
pipe
or
harp
except
they
give
a
distinction
in
the
sounds
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
piped
or
harped
14
8
for
if
the
trumpet
give
an
uncertain
sound
who
shall
prepare
himself
to
the
battle
14
9
so
likewise
ye
except
ye
utter
by
the
tongue
words
easy
to
be
understood
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
spoken
for
ye
shall
speak
into
the
air
14
10
there
are
it
may
be
so
many
kinds
of
voices
in
the
world
and
none
of
them
is
without
signification
14
11
therefore
if
i
know
not
the
meaning
of
the
voice
i
shall
be
unto
him
that
speaketh
a
barbarian
and
he
that
speaketh
shall
be
a
barbarian
unto
me
14
12
even
so
ye
forasmuch
as
ye
are
zealous
of
spiritual
gifts
seek
that
ye
may
excel
to
the
edifying
of
the
church
14
13
wherefore
let
him
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
pray
that
he
may
interpret
14
14
for
if
i
pray
in
an
unknown
tongue
my
spirit
prayeth
but
my
understanding
is
unfruitful
14
15
what
is
it
then
i
will
pray
with
the
spirit
and
i
will
pray
with
the
understanding
also
i
will
sing
with
the
spirit
and
i
will
sing
with
the
understanding
also
14
16
else
when
thou
shalt
bless
with
the
spirit
how
shall
he
that
occupieth
the
room
of
the
unlearned
say
amen
at
thy
giving
of
thanks
seeing
he
understandeth
not
what
thou
sayest
14
17
for
thou
verily
givest
thanks
well
but
the
other
is
not
edified
14
18
i
thank
my
god
i
speak
with
tongues
more
than
ye
all
14
19
yet
in
the
church
i
had
rather
speak
five
words
with
my
understanding
that
by
my
voice
i
might
teach
others
also
than
ten
thousand
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
14
20
brethren
be
not
children
in
understanding
howbeit
in
malice
be
ye
children
but
in
understanding
be
men
14
21
in
the
law
it
is
written
with
men
of
other
tongues
and
other
lips
will
i
speak
unto
this
people
and
yet
for
all
that
will
they
not
hear
me
saith
the
lord
14
22
wherefore
tongues
are
for
a
sign
not
to
them
that
believe
but
to
them
that
believe
not
but
prophesying
serveth
not
for
them
that
believe
not
but
for
them
which
believe
14
23
if
therefore
the
whole
church
be
come
together
into
one
place
and
all
speak
with
tongues
and
there
come
in
those
that
are
unlearned
or
unbelievers
will
they
not
say
that
ye
are
mad
14
24
but
if
all
prophesy
and
there
come
in
one
that
believeth
not
or
one
unlearned
he
is
convinced
of
all
he
is
judged
of
all
14
25
and
thus
are
the
secrets
of
his
heart
made
manifest
and
so
falling
down
on
his
face
he
will
worship
god
and
report
that
god
is
in
you
of
a
truth
14
26
how
is
it
then
brethren
when
ye
come
together
every
one
of
you
hath
a
psalm
hath
a
doctrine
hath
a
tongue
hath
a
revelation
hath
an
interpretation
let
all
things
be
done
unto
edifying
14
27
if
any
man
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue
let
it
be
by
two
or
at
the
most
by
three
and
that
by
course
and
let
one
interpret
14
28
but
if
there
be
no
interpreter
let
him
keep
silence
in
the
church
and
let
him
speak
to
himself
and
to
god
14
29
let
the
prophets
speak
two
or
three
and
let
the
other
judge
14
30
if
any
thing
be
revealed
to
another
that
sitteth
by
let
the
first
hold
his
peace
14
31
for
ye
may
all
prophesy
one
by
one
that
all
may
learn
and
all
may
be
comforted
14
32
and
the
spirits
of
the
prophets
are
subject
to
the
prophets
14
33
for
god
is
not
the
author
of
confusion
but
of
peace
as
in
all
churches
of
the
saints
14
34
let
your
women
keep
silence
in
the
churches
for
it
is
not
permitted
unto
them
to
speak
but
they
are
commanded
to
be
under
obedience
as
also
saith
the
law
14
35
and
if
they
will
learn
any
thing
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
home
for
it
is
a
shame
for
women
to
speak
in
the
church
14
36
what
came
the
word
of
god
out
from
you
or
came
it
unto
you
only
14
37
if
any
man
think
himself
to
be
a
prophet
or
spiritual
let
him
acknowledge
that
the
things
that
i
write
unto
you
are
the
commandments
of
the
lord
14
38
but
if
any
man
be
ignorant
let
him
be
ignorant
14
39
wherefore
brethren
covet
to
prophesy
and
forbid
not
to
speak
with
tongues
14
40
let
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
order
15
1
moreover
brethren
i
declare
unto
you
the
gospel
which
i
preached
unto
you
which
also
ye
have
received
and
wherein
ye
stand
15
2
by
which
also
ye
are
saved
if
ye
keep
in
memory
what
i
preached
unto
you
unless
ye
have
believed
in
vain
15
3
for
i
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
i
also
received
how
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scriptures
15
4
and
that
he
was
buried
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
scriptures
15
5
and
that
he
was
seen
of
cephas
then
of
the
twelve
15
6
after
that
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
once
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
present
but
some
are
fallen
asleep
15
7
after
that
he
was
seen
of
james
then
of
all
the
apostles
15
8
and
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
also
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
time
15
9
for
i
am
the
least
of
the
apostles
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
apostle
because
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
15
10
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
what
i
am
and
his
grace
which
was
bestowed
upon
me
was
not
in
vain
but
i
laboured
more
abundantly
than
they
all
yet
not
i
but
the
grace
of
god
which
was
with
me
15
11
therefore
whether
it
were
i
or
they
so
we
preach
and
so
ye
believed
15
12
now
if
christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
dead
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
15
13
but
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
then
is
christ
not
risen
15
14
and
if
christ
be
not
risen
then
is
our
preaching
vain
and
your
faith
is
also
vain
15
15
yea
and
we
are
found
false
witnesses
of
god
because
we
have
testified
of
god
that
he
raised
up
christ
whom
he
raised
not
up
if
so
be
that
the
dead
rise
not
15
16
for
if
the
dead
rise
not
then
is
not
christ
raised
15
17
and
if
christ
be
not
raised
your
faith
is
vain
ye
are
yet
in
your
sins
15
18
then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
christ
are
perished
15
19
if
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
christ
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable
15
20
but
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
and
become
the
firstfruits
of
them
that
slept
15
21
for
since
by
man
came
death
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
15
22
for
as
in
adam
all
die
even
so
in
christ
shall
all
be
made
alive
15
23
but
every
man
in
his
own
order
christ
the
firstfruits
afterward
they
that
are
christ’s
at
his
coming
15
24
then
cometh
the
end
when
he
shall
have
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
father
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
15
25
for
he
must
reign
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet
15
26
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
15
27
for
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
but
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
him
it
is
manifest
that
he
is
excepted
which
did
put
all
things
under
him
15
28
and
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
him
then
shall
the
son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
under
him
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
15
29
else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
dead
15
30
and
why
stand
we
in
jeopardy
every
hour
15
31
i
protest
by
your
rejoicing
which
i
have
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
i
die
daily
15
32
if
after
the
manner
of
men
i
have
fought
with
beasts
at
ephesus
what
advantageth
it
me
if
the
dead
rise
not
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
to
morrow
we
die
15
33
be
not
deceived
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners
15
34
awake
to
righteousness
and
sin
not
for
some
have
not
the
knowledge
of
god
i
speak
this
to
your
shame
15
35
but
some
man
will
say
how
are
the
dead
raised
up
and
with
what
body
do
they
come
15
36
thou
fool
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
15
37
and
that
which
thou
sowest
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
be
but
bare
grain
it
may
chance
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
grain
15
38
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body
15
39
all
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
but
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
men
another
flesh
of
beasts
another
of
fishes
and
another
of
birds
15
40
there
are
also
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
15
41
there
is
one
glory
of
the
sun
and
another
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
glory
of
the
stars
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory
15
42
so
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
it
is
sown
in
corruption
it
is
raised
in
incorruption
15
43
it
is
sown
in
dishonour
it
is
raised
in
glory
it
is
sown
in
weakness
it
is
raised
in
power
15
44
it
is
sown
a
natural
body
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
body
there
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
15
45
and
so
it
is
written
the
first
man
adam
was
made
a
living
soul
the
last
adam
was
made
a
quickening
spirit
15
46
howbeit
that
was
not
first
which
is
spiritual
but
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual
15
47
the
first
man
is
of
the
earth
earthy
the
second
man
is
the
lord
from
heaven
15
48
as
is
the
earthy
such
are
they
also
that
are
earthy
and
as
is
the
heavenly
such
are
they
also
that
are
heavenly
15
49
and
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
earthy
we
shall
also
bear
the
image
of
the
heavenly
15
50
now
this
i
say
brethren
that
flesh
and
blood
cannot
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
doth
corruption
inherit
incorruption
15
51
behold
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
sleep
but
we
shall
all
be
changed
15
52
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
at
the
last
trump
for
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
we
shall
be
changed
15
53
for
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
15
54
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
15
55
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
15
56
the
sting
of
death
is
sin
and
the
strength
of
sin
is
the
law
15
57
but
thanks
be
to
god
which
giveth
us
the
victory
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
15
58
therefore
my
beloved
brethren
be
ye
stedfast
unmoveable
always
abounding
in
the
work
of
the
lord
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
your
labour
is
not
in
vain
in
the
lord
16
1
now
concerning
the
collection
for
the
saints
as
i
have
given
order
to
the
churches
of
galatia
even
so
do
ye
16
2
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
let
every
one
of
you
lay
by
him
in
store
as
god
hath
prospered
him
that
there
be
no
gatherings
when
i
come
16
3
and
when
i
come
whomsoever
ye
shall
approve
by
your
letters
them
will
i
send
to
bring
your
liberality
unto
jerusalem
16
4
and
if
it
be
meet
that
i
go
also
they
shall
go
with
me
16
5
now
i
will
come
unto
you
when
i
shall
pass
through
macedonia
for
i
do
pass
through
macedonia
16
6
and
it
may
be
that
i
will
abide
yea
and
winter
with
you
that
ye
may
bring
me
on
my
journey
whithersoever
i
go
16
7
for
i
will
not
see
you
now
by
the
way
but
i
trust
to
tarry
a
while
with
you
if
the
lord
permit
16
8
but
i
will
tarry
at
ephesus
until
pentecost
16
9
for
a
great
door
and
effectual
is
opened
unto
me
and
there
are
many
adversaries
16
10
now
if
timotheus
come
see
that
he
may
be
with
you
without
fear
for
he
worketh
the
work
of
the
lord
as
i
also
do
16
11
let
no
man
therefore
despise
him
but
conduct
him
forth
in
peace
that
he
may
come
unto
me
for
i
look
for
him
with
the
brethren
16
12
as
touching
our
brother
apollos
i
greatly
desired
him
to
come
unto
you
with
the
brethren
but
his
will
was
not
at
all
to
come
at
this
time
but
he
will
come
when
he
shall
have
convenient
time
16
13
watch
ye
stand
fast
in
the
faith
quit
you
like
men
be
strong
16
14
let
all
your
things
be
done
with
charity
16
15
i
beseech
you
brethren
(ye
know
the
house
of
stephanas
that
it
is
the
firstfruits
of
achaia
and
that
they
have
addicted
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
saints
)
16
16
that
ye
submit
yourselves
unto
such
and
to
every
one
that
helpeth
with
us
and
laboureth
16
17
i
am
glad
of
the
coming
of
stephanas
and
fortunatus
and
achaicus
for
that
which
was
lacking
on
your
part
they
have
supplied
16
18
for
they
have
refreshed
my
spirit
and
yours
therefore
acknowledge
ye
them
that
are
such
16
19
the
churches
of
asia
salute
you
aquila
and
priscilla
salute
you
much
in
the
lord
with
the
church
that
is
in
their
house
16
20
all
the
brethren
greet
you
greet
ye
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss
16

the
salutation
of
me
paul
with
mine
own
hand
16
22
if
any
man
love
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
let
him
be
anathema
maranatha
16
23
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
you
16

my

will
of

even
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
father
of
mercies
and
the
god
of
all
comfort
1

who
comforteth
us
in
all
our
tribulation
that
we
may
be
able
to
comfort
them
which
are
in
any
trouble
by
the
comfort
wherewith
we
ourselves
are
comforted
of
god
1
5
for
as
the
sufferings
of
christ
abound
in
us
so
our
consolation
also
aboundeth
by
christ

and
whether
we
be
afflicted
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation
which
is
effectual
in
the
enduring
of
the
same
sufferings
which
we
also
suffer
or
whether
we
be
comforted
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation
1
7
and
our
hope
of
you
is
stedfast
knowing
that
as
ye
are
partakers
of
the
sufferings
so
shall
ye
be
also
of
the
consolation
1
8
for
we
would
not
brethren
have
you
ignorant
of
our
trouble
which
came
to
us
in
asia
that
we
were
pressed
out
of
measure
above
strength
insomuch
that
we
despaired
even
of
life
1
9
but
we
had
the
sentence
of
death
in
ourselves
that
we
should
not
trust
in
ourselves
but
in
god
which
raiseth
the
dead
1
10
who
delivered
us
from
so
great
a
death
and
doth
deliver
in
whom
we
trust
that
he
will
yet
deliver
us
1
11
ye
also
helping
together
by
prayer
for
us
that
for
the
gift
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
means
of
many
persons
thanks
may
be
given
by
many
on
our
behalf
1
12
for
our
rejoicing
is
this
the
testimony
of
our
conscience
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
but
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
world
and
more
abundantly
to
you-ward
1
13
for
we
write
none
other
things
unto
you
than
what
ye
read
or
acknowledge
and
i
trust
ye
shall
acknowledge
even
to
the
end
1
14
as
also
ye
have
acknowledged
us
in
part
that
we
are
your
rejoicing
even
as
ye
also
are
ours
in
the
day
of
the
lord
jesus
1
15
and
in
this
confidence
i
was
minded
to
come
unto
you
before
that
ye
might
have
a
second
benefit
1
16
and
to
pass
by
you
into
macedonia
and
to
come
again
out
of
macedonia
unto
you
and
of
you
to
be
brought
on
my
way
toward
judaea
1
17
when
i
therefore
was
thus
minded
did
i
use
lightness
or
the
things
that
i
purpose
do
i
purpose
according
to
the
flesh
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
1
18
but
as
god
is
true
our
word
toward
you
was
not
yea
and
nay
1
19
for
the
son
of
god
jesus
christ
who
was
preached
among
you
by
us
even
by
me
and
silvanus
and
timotheus
was
not
yea
and
nay
but
in
him
was
yea
1
20
for
all
the
promises
of
god
in
him
are
yea
and
in
him
amen
unto
the
glory
of
god
by
us
1
21
now
he
which
stablisheth
us
with
you
in
christ
and
hath
anointed
us
is
god
1
22
who
hath
also
sealed
us
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
in
our
hearts
1
23
moreover
i
call
god
for
a
record
upon
my
soul
that
to
spare
you
i
came
not
as
yet
unto
corinth
1
24
not
for
that
we
have
dominion
over
your
faith
but
are
helpers
of
your
joy
for
by
faith
ye
stand
2
1
but
i
determined
this
with
myself
that
i
would
not
come
again
to
you
in
heaviness
2
2
for
if
i
make
you
sorry
who
is
he
then
that
maketh
me
glad
but
the
same
which
is
made
sorry
by
me
2
3
and
i
wrote
this
same
unto
you
lest
when
i
came
i
should
have
sorrow
from
them
of
whom
i
ought
to
rejoice
having
confidence
in
you
all
that
my
joy
is
the
joy
of
you
all
2
4
for
out
of
much
affliction
and
anguish
of
heart
i
wrote
unto
you
with
many
tears
not
that
ye
should
be
grieved
but
that
ye
might
know
the
love
which
i
have
more
abundantly
unto
you
2
5
but
if
any
have
caused
grief
he
hath
not
grieved
me
but
in
part
that
i
may
not
overcharge
you
all
2
6
sufficient
to
such
a
man
is
this
punishment
which
was
inflicted
of
many
2
7
so
that
contrariwise
ye
ought
rather
to
forgive
him
and
comfort
him
lest
perhaps
such
a
one
should
be
swallowed
up
with
overmuch
sorrow
2
8
wherefore
i
beseech
you
that
ye
would
confirm
your
love
toward
him
2
9
for
to
this
end
also
did
i
write
that
i
might
know
the
proof
of
you
whether
ye
be
obedient
in
all
things
2
10
to
whom
ye
forgive
any
thing
i
forgive
also
for
if
i
forgave
any
thing
to
whom
i
forgave
it
for
your
sakes
forgave
i
it
in
the
person
of
christ
2
11
lest
satan
should
get
an
advantage
of
us
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
his
devices
2
12
furthermore
when
i
came
to
troas
to
preach
christ’s
gospel
and
a
door
was
opened
unto
me
of
the
lord
2
13
i
had
no
rest
in
my
spirit
because
i
found
not
titus
my
brother
but
taking
my
leave
of
them
i
went
from
thence
into
macedonia
2
14
now
thanks
be
unto
god
which
always
causeth
us
to
triumph
in
christ
and
maketh
manifest
the
savour
of
his
knowledge
by
us
in
every
place
2
15
for
we
are
unto
god
a
sweet
savour
of
christ
in
them
that
are
saved
and
in
them
that
perish
2
16
to
the
one
we
are
the
savour
of
death
unto
death
and
to
the
other
the
savour
of
life
unto
life
and
who
is
sufficient
for
these
things
2
17
for
we
are
not
as
many
which
corrupt
the
word
of
god
but
as
of
sincerity
but
as
of
god
in
the
sight
of
god
speak
we
in
christ
3
1
do
we
begin
again
to
commend
ourselves
or
need
we
as
some
others
epistles
of
commendation
to
you
or
letters
of
commendation
from
you
3
2
ye
are
our
epistle
written
in
our
hearts
known
and
read
of
all
men
3
3
forasmuch
as
ye
are
manifestly
declared
to
be
the
epistle
of
christ
ministered
by
us
written
not
with
ink
but
with
the
spirit
of
the
living
god
not
in
tables
of
stone
but
in
fleshy
tables
of
the
heart
3
4
and
such
trust
have
we
through
christ
to
god-ward
3
5
not
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
think
any
thing
as
of
ourselves
but
our
sufficiency
is
of
god
3
6
who
also
hath
made
us
able
ministers
of
the
new
testament
not
of
the
letter
but
of
the
spirit
for
the
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
3
7
but
if
the
ministration
of
death
written
and
engraven
in
stones
was
glorious
so
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
behold
the
face
of
moses
for
the
glory
of
his
countenance
which
glory
was
to
be
done
away
3
8
how
shall
not
the
ministration
of
the
spirit
be
rather
glorious
3
9
for
if
the
ministration
of
condemnation
be
glory
much
more
doth
the
ministration
of
righteousness
exceed
in
glory
3
10
for
even
that
which
was
made
glorious
had
no
glory
in
this
respect
by
reason
of
the
glory
that
excelleth
3
11
for
if
that
which
is
done
away
was
glorious
much
more
that
which
remaineth
is
glorious
3
12
seeing
then
that
we
have
such
hope
we
use
great
plainness
of
speech
3
13
and
not
as
moses
which
put
a
vail
over
his
face
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
look
to
the
end
of
that
which
is
abolished
3
14
but
their
minds
were
blinded
for
until
this
day
remaineth
the
same
vail
untaken
away
in
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
which
vail
is
done
away
in
christ
3
15
but
even
unto
this
day
when
moses
is
read
the
vail
is
upon
their
heart
3
16
nevertheless
when
it
shall
turn
to
the
lord
the
vail
shall
be
taken
away
3
17
now
the
lord
is
that
spirit
and
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
there
is
liberty
3
18
but
we
all
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
lord
are
changed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
to
glory
even
as
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
4
1
therefore
seeing
we
have
this
ministry
as
we
have
received
mercy
we
faint
not
4
2
but
have
renounced
the
hidden
things
of
dishonesty
not
walking
in
craftiness
nor
handling
the
word
of
god
deceitfully
but
by
manifestation
of
the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
man’s
conscience
in
the
sight
of
god
4
3
but
if
our
gospel
be
hid
it
is
hid
to
them
that
are
lost
4
4
in
whom
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
who
is
the
image
of
god
should
shine
unto
them
4
5
for
we
preach
not
ourselves
but
christ
jesus
the
lord
and
ourselves
your
servants
for
jesus’
sake
4
6
for
god
who
commanded
the
light
to
shine
out
of
darkness
hath
shined
in
our
hearts
to
give
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
in
the
face
of
jesus
christ
4
7
but
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
vessels
that
the
excellency
of
the
power
may
be
of
god
and
not
of
us
4
8
we
are
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
we
are
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
4
9
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
4
10
always
bearing
about
in
the
body
the
dying
of
the
lord
jesus
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
body
4
11
for
we
which
live
are
alway
delivered
unto
death
for
jesus’
sake
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
mortal
flesh
4
12
so
then
death
worketh
in
us
but
life
in
you
4
13
we
having
the
same
spirit
of
faith
according
as
it
is
written
i
believed
and
therefore
have
i
spoken
we
also
believe
and
therefore
speak
4
14
knowing
that
he
which
raised
up
the
lord
jesus
shall
raise
up
us
also
by
jesus
and
shall
present
us
with
you
4
15
for
all
things
are
for
your
sakes
that
the
abundant
grace
might
through
the
thanksgiving
of
many
redound
to
the
glory
of
god
4
16
for
which
cause
we
faint
not
but
though
our
outward
man
perish
yet
the
inward
man
is
renewed
day
by
day
4
17
for
our
light
affliction
which
is
but
for
a
moment
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
glory
4
18
while
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
seen
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
seen
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal
5
1
for
we
know
that
if
our
earthly
house
of
this
tabernacle
were
dissolved
we
have
a
building
of
god
an
house
not
made
with
hands
eternal
in
the
heavens
5
2
for
in
this
we
groan
earnestly
desiring
to
be
clothed
upon
with
our
house
which
is
from
heaven
5
3
if
so
be
that
being
clothed
we
shall
not
be
found
naked
5
4
for
we
that
are
in
this
tabernacle
do
groan
being
burdened
not
for
that
we
would
be
unclothed
but
clothed
upon
that
mortality
might
be
swallowed
up
of
life
5
5
now
he
that
hath
wrought
us
for
the
selfsame
thing
is
god
who
also
hath
given
unto
us
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
5
6
therefore
we
are
always
confident
knowing
that
whilst
we
are
at
home
in
the
body
we
are
absent
from
the
lord
5
7
(for
we
walk
by
faith
not
by
sight
)
5
8
we
are
confident
i
say
and
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
body
and
to
be
present
with
the
lord
5
9
wherefore
we
labour
that
whether
present
or
absent
we
may
be
accepted
of
him
5
10
for
we
must
all
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
that
every
one
may
receive
the
things
done
in
his
body
according
to
that
he
hath
done
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
5
11
knowing
therefore
the
terror
of
the
lord
we
persuade
men
but
we
are
made
manifest
unto
god
and
i
trust
also
are
made
manifest
in
your
consciences
5
12
for
we
commend
not
ourselves
again
unto
you
but
give
you
occasion
to
glory
on
our
behalf
that
ye
may
have
somewhat
to
answer
them
which
glory
in
appearance
and
not
in
heart
5
13
for
whether
we
be
beside
ourselves
it
is
to
god
or
whether
we
be
sober
it
is
for
your
cause
5
14
for
the
love
of
christ
constraineth
us
because
we
thus
judge
that
if
one
died
for
all
then
were
all
dead
5
15
and
that
he
died
for
all
that
they
which
live
should
not
henceforth
live
unto
themselves
but
unto
him
which
died
for
them
and
rose
again
5
16
wherefore
henceforth
know
we
no
man
after
the
flesh
yea
though
we
have
known
christ
after
the
flesh
yet
now
henceforth
know
we
him
no
more
5
17
therefore
if
any
man
be
in
christ
he
is
a
new
creature
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
all
things
are
become
new
5
18
and
all
things
are
of
god
who
hath
reconciled
us
to
himself
by
jesus
christ
and
hath
given
to
us
the
ministry
of
reconciliation
5
19
to
wit
that
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
them
and
hath
committed
unto
us
the
word
of
reconciliation
5
20
now
then
we
are
ambassadors
for
christ
as
though
god
did
beseech
you
by
us
we
pray
you
in
christ’s
stead
be
ye
reconciled
to
god
5
21
for
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
him
6
1
we
then
as
workers
together
with
him
beseech
you
also
that
ye
receive
not
the
grace
of
god
in
vain
6
2
(for
he
saith
i
have
heard
thee
in
a
time
accepted
and
in
the
day
of
salvation
have
i
succoured
thee
behold
now
is
the
accepted
time
behold
now
is
the
day
of
salvation
)
6
3
giving
no
offence
in
any
thing
that
the
ministry
be
not
blamed
6
4
but
in
all
things
approving
ourselves
as
the
ministers
of
god
in
much
patience
in
afflictions
in
necessities
in
distresses
6
5
in
stripes
in
imprisonments
in
tumults
in
labours
in
watchings
in
fastings
6
6
by
pureness
by
knowledge
by
longsuffering
by
kindness
by
the
holy
ghost
by
love
unfeigned
6
7
by
the
word
of
truth
by
the
power
of
god
by
the
armour
of
righteousness
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
6
8
by
honour
and
dishonour
by
evil
report
and
good
report
as
deceivers
and
yet
true
6
9
as
unknown
and
yet
well
known
as
dying
and
behold
we
live
as
chastened
and
not
killed
6
10
as
sorrowful
yet
alway
rejoicing
as
poor
yet
making
many
rich
as
having
nothing
and
yet
possessing
all
things
6
11
o
ye
corinthians
our
mouth
is
open
unto
you
our
heart
is
enlarged
6
12
ye
are
not
straitened
in
us
but
ye
are
straitened
in
your
own
bowels
6
13
now
for
a
recompence
in
the
same
(i
speak
as
unto
my
children
)
be
ye
also
enlarged
6
14
be
ye
not
unequally
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
hath
righteousness
with
unrighteousness
and
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
6
15
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
or
what
part
hath
he
that
believeth
with
an
infidel
6
16
and
what
agreement
hath
the
temple
of
god
with
idols
for
ye
are
the
temple
of
the
living
god
as
god
hath
said
i
will
dwell
in
them
and
walk
in
them
and
i
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
6
17
wherefore
come
out
from
among
them
and
be
ye
separate
saith
the
lord
and
touch
not
the
unclean
thing
and
i
will
receive
you
6
18
and
will
be
a
father
unto
you
and
ye
shall
be
my
sons
and
daughters
saith
the
lord
almighty
7
1
having
therefore
these
promises
dearly
beloved
let
us
cleanse
ourselves
from
all
filthiness
of
the
flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
the
fear
of
god
7
2
receive
us
we
have
wronged
no
man
we
have
corrupted
no
man
we
have
defrauded
no
man
7
3
i
speak
not
this
to
condemn
you
for
i
have
said
before
that
ye
are
in
our
hearts
to
die
and
live
with
you
7
4
great
is
my
boldness
of
speech
toward
you
great
is
my
glorying
of
you
i
am
filled
with
comfort
i
am
exceeding
joyful
in
all
our
tribulation
7
5
for
when
we
were
come
into
macedonia
our
flesh
had
no
rest
but
we
were
troubled
on
every
side
without
were
fightings
within
were
fears
7
6
nevertheless
god
that
comforteth
those
that
are
cast
down
comforted
us
by
the
coming
of
titus
7
7
and
not
by
his
coming
only
but
by
the
consolation
wherewith
he
was
comforted
in
you
when
he
told
us
your
earnest
desire
your
mourning
your
fervent
mind
toward
me
so
that
i
rejoiced
the
more
7
8
for
though
i
made
you
sorry
with
a
letter
i
do
not
repent
though
i
did
repent
for
i
perceive
that
the
same
epistle
hath
made
you
sorry
though
it
were
but
for
a
season
7
9
now
i
rejoice
not
that
ye
were
made
sorry
but
that
ye
sorrowed
to
repentance
for
ye
were
made
sorry
after
a
godly
manner
that
ye
might
receive
damage
by
us
in
nothing
7
10
for
godly
sorrow
worketh
repentance
to
salvation
not
to
be
repented
of
but
the
sorrow
of
the
world
worketh
death
7
11
for
behold
this
selfsame
thing
that
ye
sorrowed
after
a
godly
sort
what
carefulness
it
wrought
in
you
yea
what
clearing
of
yourselves
yea
what
indignation
yea
what
fear
yea
what
vehement
desire
yea
what
zeal
yea
what
revenge
in
all
things
ye
have
approved
yourselves
to
be
clear
in
this
matter
7
12
wherefore
though
i
wrote
unto
you
i
did
it
not
for
his
cause
that
had
done
the
wrong
nor
for
his
cause
that
suffered
wrong
but
that
our
care
for
you
in
the
sight
of
god
might
appear
unto
you
7
13
therefore
we
were
comforted
in
your
comfort
yea
and
exceedingly
the
more
joyed
we
for
the
joy
of
titus
because
his
spirit
was
refreshed
by
you
all
7
14
for
if
i
have
boasted
any
thing
to
him
of
you
i
am
not
ashamed
but
as
we
spake
all
things
to
you
in
truth
even
so
our
boasting
which
i
made
before
titus
is
found
a
truth
7
15
and
his
inward
affection
is
more
abundant
toward
you
whilst
he
remembereth
the
obedience
of
you
all
how
with
fear
and
trembling
ye
received
him
7
16
i
rejoice
therefore
that
i
have
confidence
in
you
in
all
things
8
1
moreover
brethren
we
do
you
to
wit
of
the
grace
of
god
bestowed
on
the
churches
of
macedonia
8
2
how
that
in
a
great
trial
of
affliction
the
abundance
of
their
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
abounded
unto
the
riches
of
their
liberality
8
3
for
to
their
power
i
bear
record
yea
and
beyond
their
power
they
were
willing
of
themselves
8
4
praying
us
with
much
intreaty
that
we
would
receive
the
gift
and
take
upon
us
the
fellowship
of
the
ministering
to
the
saints
8
5
and
this
they
did
not
as
we
hoped
but
first
gave
their
own
selves
to
the
lord
and
unto
us
by
the
will
of
god
8
6
insomuch
that
we
desired
titus
that
as
he
had
begun
so
he
would
also
finish
in
you
the
same
grace
also
8
7
therefore
as
ye
abound
in
every
thing
in
faith
and
utterance
and
knowledge
and
in
all
diligence
and
in
your
love
to
us
see
that
ye
abound
in
this
grace
also
8
8
i
speak
not
by
commandment
but
by
occasion
of
the
forwardness
of
others
and
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
your
love
8
9
for
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
poor
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
8
10
and
herein
i
give
my
advice
for
this
is
expedient
for
you
who
have
begun
before
not
only
to
do
but
also
to
be
forward
a
year
ago
8
11
now
therefore
perform
the
doing
of
it
that
as
there
was
a
readiness
to
will
so
there
may
be
a
performance
also
out
of
that
which
ye
have
8
12
for
if
there
be
first
a
willing
mind
it
is
accepted
according
to
that
a
man
hath
and
not
according
to
that
he
hath
not
8
13
for
i
mean
not
that
other
men
be
eased
and
ye
burdened
8
14
but
by
an
equality
that
now
at
this
time
your
abundance
may
be
a
supply
for
their
want
that
their
abundance
also
may
be
a
supply
for
your
want
that
there
may
be
equality
8
15
as
it
is
written
he
that
had
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
he
that
had
gathered
little
had
no
lack
8
16
but
thanks
be
to
god
which
put
the
same
earnest
care
into
the
heart
of
titus
for
you
8
17
for
indeed
he
accepted
the
exhortation
but
being
more
forward
of
his
own
accord
he
went
unto
you
8
18
and
we
have
sent
with
him
the
brother
whose
praise
is
in
the
gospel
throughout
all
the
churches
8
19
and
not
that
only
but
who
was
also
chosen
of
the
churches
to
travel
with
us
with
this
grace
which
is
administered
by
us
to
the
glory
of
the
same
lord
and
declaration
of
your
ready
mind
8
20
avoiding
this
that
no
man
should
blame
us
in
this
abundance
which
is
administered
by
us
8
21
providing
for
honest
things
not
only
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
also
in
the
sight
of
men
8
22
and
we
have
sent
with
them
our
brother
whom
we
have
oftentimes
proved
diligent
in
many
things
but
now
much
more
diligent
upon
the
great
confidence
which
i
have
in
you
8
23
whether
any
do
enquire
of
titus
he
is
my
partner
and
fellowhelper
concerning
you
or
our
brethren
be
enquired
of
they
are
the
messengers
of
the
churches
and
the
glory
of
christ
8
24
wherefore
shew
ye
to
them
and
before
the
churches
the
proof
of
your
love
and
of
our
boasting
on
your
behalf
9
1
for
as
touching
the
ministering
to
the
saints
it
is
superfluous
for
me
to
write
to
you
9
2
for
i
know
the
forwardness
of
your
mind
for
which
i
boast
of
you
to
them
of
macedonia
that
achaia
was
ready
a
year
ago
and
your
zeal
hath
provoked
very
many
9
3
yet
have
i
sent
the
brethren
lest
our
boasting
of
you
should
be
in
vain
in
this
behalf
that
as
i
said
ye
may
be
ready
9
4
lest
haply
if
they
of
macedonia
come
with
me
and
find
you
unprepared
we
(that
we
say
not
ye)
should
be
ashamed
in
this
same
confident
boasting
9
5
therefore
i
thought
it
necessary
to
exhort
the
brethren
that
they
would
go
before
unto
you
and
make
up
beforehand
your
bounty
whereof
ye
had
notice
before
that
the
same
might
be
ready
as
a
matter
of
bounty
and
not
as
of
covetousness
9
6
but
this
i
say
he
which
soweth
sparingly
shall
reap
also
sparingly
and
he
which
soweth
bountifully
shall
reap
also
bountifully
9
7
every
man
according
as
he
purposeth
in
his
heart
so
let
him
give
not
grudgingly
or
of
necessity
for
god
loveth
a
cheerful
giver
9
8
and
god
is
able
to
make
all
grace
abound
toward
you
that
ye
always
having
all
sufficiency
in
all
things
may
abound
to
every
good
work
9
9
(as
it
is
written
he
hath
dispersed
abroad
he
hath
given
to
the
poor
his
righteousness
remaineth
for
ever
9
10
now
he
that
ministereth
seed
to
the
sower
both
minister
bread
for
your
food
and
multiply
your
seed
sown
and
increase
the
fruits
of
your
righteousness
)
9
11
being
enriched
in
every
thing
to
all
bountifulness
which
causeth
through
us
thanksgiving
to
god
9
12
for
the
administration
of
this
service
not
only
supplieth
the
want
of
the
saints
but
is
abundant
also
by
many
thanksgivings
unto
god
9
13
whiles
by
the
experiment
of
this
ministration
they
glorify
god
for
your
professed
subjection
unto
the
gospel
of
christ
and
for
your
liberal
distribution
unto
them
and
unto
all
men
9
14
and
by
their
prayer
for
you
which
long
after
you
for
the
exceeding
grace
of
god
in
you
9
15
thanks
be
unto
god
for
his
unspeakable
gift
10
1
now
i
paul
myself
beseech
you
by
the
meekness
and
gentleness
of
christ
who
in
presence
am
base
among
you
but
being
absent
am
bold
toward
you
10
2
but
i
beseech
you
that
i
may
not
be
bold
when
i
am
present
with
that
confidence
wherewith
i
think
to
be
bold
against
some
which
think
of
us
as
if
we
walked
according
to
the
flesh
10
3
for
though
we
walk
in
the
flesh
we
do
not
war
after
the
flesh
10
4
(for
the
weapons
of
our
warfare
are
not
carnal
but
mighty
through
god
to
the
pulling
down
of
strong
holds
)
10
5
casting
down
imaginations
and
every
high
thing
that
exalteth
itself
against
the
knowledge
of
god
and
bringing
into
captivity
every
thought
to
the
obedience
of
christ
10
6
and
having
in
a
readiness
to
revenge
all
disobedience
when
your
obedience
is
fulfilled
10
7
do
ye
look
on
things
after
the
outward
appearance
if
any
man
trust
to
himself
that
he
is
christ’s
let
him
of
himself
think
this
again
that
as
he
is
christ’s
even
so
are
we
christ’s
10
8
for
though
i
should
boast
somewhat
more
of
our
authority
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
for
edification
and
not
for
your
destruction
i
should
not
be
ashamed
10
9
that
i
may
not
seem
as
if
i
would
terrify
you
by
letters
10
10
for
his
letters
say
they
are
weighty
and
powerful
but
his
bodily
presence
is
weak
and
his
speech
contemptible
10
11
let
such
an
one
think
this
that
such
as
we
are
in
word
by
letters
when
we
are
absent
such
will
we
be
also
in
deed
when
we
are
present
10
12
for
we
dare
not
make
ourselves
of
the
number
or
compare
ourselves
with
some
that
commend
themselves
but
they
measuring
themselves
by
themselves
and
comparing
themselves
among
themselves
are
not
wise
10
13
but
we
will
not
boast
of
things
without
our
measure
but
according
to
the
measure
of
the
rule
which
god
hath
distributed
to
us
a
measure
to
reach
even
unto
you
10
14
for
we
stretch
not
ourselves
beyond
our
measure
as
though
we
reached
not
unto
you
for
we
are
come
as
far
as
to
you
also
in
preaching
the
gospel
of
christ
10
15
not
boasting
of
things
without
our
measure
that
is
of
other
men’s
labours
but
having
hope
when
your
faith
is
increased
that
we
shall
be
enlarged
by
you
according
to
our
rule
abundantly
10
16
to
preach
the
gospel
in
the
regions
beyond
you
and
not
to
boast
in
another
man’s
line
of
things
made
ready
to
our
hand
10
17
but
he
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
in
the
lord
10
18
for
not
he
that
commendeth
himself
is
approved
but
whom
the
lord
commendeth
11
1
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
my
folly
and
indeed
bear
with
me
11
2
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
for
i
have
espoused
you
to
one
husband
that
i
may
present
you
as
a
chaste
virgin
to
christ
11
3
but
i
fear
lest
by
any
means
as
the
serpent
beguiled
eve
through
his
subtilty
so
your
minds
should
be
corrupted
from
the
simplicity
that
is
in
christ
11
4
for
if
he
that
cometh
preacheth
another
jesus
whom
we
have
not
preached
or
if
ye
receive
another
spirit
which
ye
have
not
received
or
another
gospel
which
ye
have
not
accepted
ye
might
well
bear
with
him
11
5
for
i
suppose
i
was
not
a
whit
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
11
6
but
though
i
be
rude
in
speech
yet
not
in
knowledge
but
we
have
been
throughly
made
manifest
among
you
in
all
things
11
7
have
i
committed
an
offence
in
abasing
myself
that
ye
might
be
exalted
because
i
have
preached
to
you
the
gospel
of
god
freely
11
8
i
robbed
other
churches
taking
wages
of
them
to
do
you
service
11
9
and
when
i
was
present
with
you
and
wanted
i
was
chargeable
to
no
man
for
that
which
was
lacking
to
me
the
brethren
which
came
from
macedonia
supplied
and
in
all
things
i
have
kept
myself
from
being
burdensome
unto
you
and
so
will
i
keep
myself
11
10
as
the
truth
of
christ
is
in
me
no
man
shall
stop
me
of
this
boasting
in
the
regions
of
achaia
11
11
wherefore
because
i
love
you
not
god
knoweth
11
12
but
what
i
do
that
i
will
do
that
i
may
cut
off
occasion
from
them
which
desire
occasion
that
wherein
they
glory
they
may
be
found
even
as
we
11
13
for
such
are
false
apostles
deceitful
workers
transforming
themselves
into
the
apostles
of
christ
11
14
and
no
marvel
for
satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
11
15
therefore
it
is
no
great
thing
if
his
ministers
also
be
transformed
as
the
ministers
of
righteousness
whose
end
shall
be
according
to
their
works
11
16
i
say
again
let
no
man
think
me
a
fool
if
otherwise
yet
as
a
fool
receive
me
that
i
may
boast
myself
a
little
11
17
that
which
i
speak
i
speak
it
not
after
the
lord
but
as
it
were
foolishly
in
this
confidence
of
boasting
11
18
seeing
that
many
glory
after
the
flesh
i
will
glory
also
11
19
for
ye
suffer
fools
gladly
seeing
ye
yourselves
are
wise
11
20
for
ye
suffer
if
a
man
bring
you
into
bondage
if
a
man
devour
you
if
a
man
take
of
you
if
a
man
exalt
himself
if
a
man
smite
you
on
the
face
11
21
i
speak
as
concerning
reproach
as
though
we
had
been
weak
howbeit
whereinsoever
any
is
bold
(i
speak
foolishly
)
i
am
bold
also
11
22
are
they
hebrews
so
am
i
are
they
israelites
so
am
i
are
they
the
seed
of
abraham
so
am
i
11
23
are
they
ministers
of
christ
(i
speak
as
a
fool)
i
am
more
in
labours
more
abundant
in
stripes
above
measure
in
prisons
more
frequent
in
deaths
oft
11
24
of
the
jews
five
times
received
i
forty
stripes
save
one
11
25
thrice
was
i
beaten
with
rods
once
was
i
stoned
thrice
i
suffered
shipwreck
a
night
and
a
day
i
have
been
in
the
deep
11
26
in
journeyings
often
in
perils
of
waters
in
perils
of
robbers
in
perils
by
mine
own
countrymen
in
perils
by
the
heathen
in
perils
in
the
city
in
perils
in
the
wilderness
in
perils
in
the
sea
in
perils
among
false
brethren
11
27
in
weariness
and
painfulness
in
watchings
often
in
hunger
and
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
11
28
beside
those
things
that
are
without
that
which
cometh
upon
me
daily
the
care
of
all
the
churches
11
29
who
is
weak
and
i
am
not
weak
who
is
offended
and
i
burn
not
11
30
if
i
must
needs
glory
i
will
glory
of
the
things
which
concern
mine
infirmities
11
31
the
god
and
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
which
is
blessed
for
evermore
knoweth
that
i
lie
not
11
32
in
damascus
the
governor
under
aretas
the
king
kept
the
city
of
the
damascenes
with
a
garrison
desirous
to
apprehend
me
11
33
and
through
a
window
in
a
basket
was
i
let
down
by
the
wall
and
escaped
his
hands
12
1
it
is
not
expedient
for
me
doubtless
to
glory
i
will
come
to
visions
and
revelations
of
the
lord
12
2
i
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
ago
(whether
in
the
body
i
cannot
tell
or
whether
out
of
the
body
i
cannot
tell
god
knoweth
)
such
an
one
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
12
3
and
i
knew
such
a
man
(whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
i
cannot
tell
god
knoweth
)
12
4
how
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter
12
5
of
such
an
one
will
i
glory
yet
of
myself
i
will
not
glory
but
in
mine
infirmities
12
6
for
though
i
would
desire
to
glory
i
shall
not
be
a
fool
for
i
will
say
the
truth
but
now
i
forbear
lest
any
man
should
think
of
me
above
that
which
he
seeth
me
to
be
or
that
he
heareth
of
me
12
7
and
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
measure
through
the
abundance
of
the
revelations
there
was
given
to
me
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
the
messenger
of
satan
to
buffet
me
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
measure
12
8
for
this
thing
i
besought
the
lord
thrice
that
it
might
depart
from
me
12
9
and
he
said
unto
me
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
for
my
strength
is
made
perfect
in
weakness
most
gladly
therefore
will
i
rather
glory
in
my
infirmities
that
the
power
of
christ
may
rest
upon
me
12
10
therefore
i
take
pleasure
in
infirmities
in
reproaches
in
necessities
in
persecutions
in
distresses
for
christ’s
sake
for
when
i
am
weak
then
am
i
strong
12
11
i
am
become
a
fool
in
glorying
ye
have
compelled
me
for
i
ought
to
have
been
commended
of
you
for
in
nothing
am
i
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
though
i
be
nothing
12
12
truly
the
signs
of
an
apostle
were
wrought
among
you
in
all
patience
in
signs
and
wonders
and
mighty
deeds
12
13
for
what
is
it
wherein
ye
were
inferior
to
other
churches
except
it
be
that
i
myself
was
not
burdensome
to
you
forgive
me
this
wrong
12
14
behold
the
third
time
i
am
ready
to
come
to
you
and
i
will
not
be
burdensome
to
you
for
i
seek
not
yours
but
you
for
the
children
ought
not
to
lay
up
for
the
parents
but
the
parents
for
the
children
12
15
and
i
will
very
gladly
spend
and
be
spent
for
you
though
the
more
abundantly
i
love
you
the
less
i
be
loved
12
16
but
be
it
so
i
did
not
burden
you
nevertheless
being
crafty
i
caught
you
with
guile
12
17
did
i
make
a
gain
of
you
by
any
of
them
whom
i
sent
unto
you
12
18
i
desired
titus
and
with
him
i
sent
a
brother
did
titus
make
a
gain
of
you
walked
we
not
in
the
same
spirit
walked
we
not
in
the
same
steps
12
19
again
think
ye
that
we
excuse
ourselves
unto
you
we
speak
before
god
in
christ
but
we
do
all
things
dearly
beloved
for
your
edifying
12
20
for
i
fear
lest
when
i
come
i
shall
not
find
you
such
as
i
would
and
that
i
shall
be
found
unto
you
such
as
ye
would
not
lest
there
be
debates
envyings
wraths
strifes
backbitings
whisperings
swellings
tumults
12
21
and
lest
when
i
come
again
my
god
will
humble
me
among
you
and
that
i
shall
bewail
many
which
have
sinned
already
and
have
not
repented
of
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
lasciviousness
which
they
have
committed
13
1
this
is
the
third
time
i
am
coming
to
you
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
shall
every
word
be
established
13
2
i
told
you
before
and
foretell
you
as
if
i
were
present
the
second
time
and
being
absent
now
i
write
to
them
which
heretofore
have
sinned
and
to
all
other
that
if
i
come
again
i
will
not
spare
13
3
since
ye
seek
a
proof
of
christ
speaking
in
me
which
to
you-ward
is
not
weak
but
is
mighty
in
you
13
4
for
though
he
was
crucified
through
weakness
yet
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
god
for
we
also
are
weak
in
him
but
we
shall
live
with
him
by
the
power
of
god
toward
you
13
5
examine
yourselves
whether
ye
be
in
the
faith
prove
your
own
selves
know
ye
not
your
own
selves
how
that
jesus
christ
is
in
you
except
ye
be
reprobates
13
6
but
i
trust
that
ye
shall
know
that
we
are
not
reprobates
13
7
now
i
pray
to
god
that
ye
do
no
evil
not
that
we
should
appear
approved
but
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
honest
though
we
be
as
reprobates
13
8
for
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
13
9
for
we
are
glad
when
we
are
weak
and
ye
are
strong
and
this
also
we
wish
even
your
perfection
13
10
therefore
i
write
these
things
being
absent
lest
being
present
i
should
use
sharpness
according
to
the
power
which
the
lord
hath
given
me
to
edification
and
not
to
destruction
13
11
finally
brethren
farewell
be
perfect
be
of
good
comfort
be
of
one
mind
live
in
peace
and
the
god
of
love
and
peace
shall
be
with
you
13
12
greet
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss
13
13
all
the
saints
salute
you
13
14
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
love
of
god
and
the
communion
of
the
holy
ghost
be
with
you
all
amen
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
galatians
1
1
paul
an
apostle
(not
of
men
neither
by
man
but
by
jesus
christ
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
)
1
2
and
all
the
brethren
which
are
with
me
unto
the
churches
of
galatia
1
3
grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
1
4
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
world
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
our
father
1
5
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
1
6
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
christ
unto
another
gospel
1
7
which
is
not
another
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
you
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
christ
1
8
but
though
we
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
you
let
him
be
accursed
1
9
as
we
said
before
so
say
i
now
again
if
any
man
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
received
let
him
be
accursed
1
10
for
do
i
now
persuade
men
or
god
or
do
i
seek
to
please
men
for
if
i
yet
pleased
men
i
should
not
be
the
servant
of
christ
1
11
but
i
certify
you
brethren
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
man
1
12
for
i
neither
received
it
of
man
neither
was
i
taught
it
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
1
13
for
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
jews’
religion
how
that
beyond
measure
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
and
wasted
it
1
14
and
profited
in
the
jews’
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
nation
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
traditions
of
my
fathers
1
15
but
when
it
pleased
god
who
separated
me
from
my
mother’s
womb
and
called
me
by
his
grace
1
16
to
reveal
his
son
in
me
that
i
might
preach
him
among
the
heathen
immediately
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
1
17
neither
went
i
up
to
jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
me
but
i
went
into
arabia
and
returned
again
unto
damascus
1
18
then
after
three
years
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
to
see
peter
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
days
1
19
but
other
of
the
apostles
saw
i
none
save
james
the
lord’s
brother
1
20
now
the
things
which
i
write
unto
you
behold
before
god
i
lie
not
1
21
afterwards
i
came
into
the
regions
of
syria
and
cilicia
1
22
and
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
judaea
which
were
in
christ
1
23
but
they
had
heard
only
that
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
destroyed
1
24
and
they
glorified
god
in
me
2
1
then
fourteen
years
after
i
went
up
again
to
jerusalem
with
barnabas
and
took
titus
with
me
also
2
2
and
i
went
up
by
revelation
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
which
i
preach
among
the
gentiles
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
reputation
lest
by
any
means
i
should
run
or
had
run
in
vain
2
3
but
neither
titus
who
was
with
me
being
a
greek
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised
2
4
and
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
in
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage
2
5
to
whom
we
gave
place
by
subjection
no
not
for
an
hour
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you
2
6
but
of
these
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
(whatsoever
they
were
it
maketh
no
matter
to
me
god
accepteth
no
man’s
person
)
for
they
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
conference
added
nothing
to
me
2
7
but
contrariwise
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
me
as
the
gospel
of
the
circumcision
was
unto
peter
2
8
(for
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
circumcision
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
gentiles
)
2
9
and
when
james
cephas
and
john
who
seemed
to
be
pillars
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
me
they
gave
to
me
and
barnabas
the
right
hands
of
fellowship
that
we
should
go
unto
the
heathen
and
they
unto
the
circumcision
2
10
only
they
would
that
we
should
remember
the
poor
the
same
which
i
also
was
forward
to
do
2
11
but
when
peter
was
come
to
antioch
i
withstood
him
to
the
face
because
he
was
to
be
blamed
2
12
for
before
that
certain
came
from
james
he
did
eat
with
the
gentiles
but
when
they
were
come
he
withdrew
and
separated
himself
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
circumcision
2
13
and
the
other
jews
dissembled
likewise
with
him
insomuch
that
barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
dissimulation
2
14
but
when
i
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel
i
said
unto
peter
before
them
all
if
thou
being
a
jew
livest
after
the
manner
of
gentiles
and
not
as
do
the
jews
why
compellest
thou
the
gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
jews
2
15
we
who
are
jews
by
nature
and
not
sinners
of
the
gentiles
2
16
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
by
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
even
we
have
believed
in
jesus
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
2
17
but
if
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
christ
we
ourselves
also
are
found
sinners
is
therefore
christ
the
minister
of
sin
god
forbid
2
18
for
if
i
build
again
the
things
which
i
destroyed
i
make
myself
a
transgressor
2
19
for
i
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
law
that
i
might
live
unto
god
2
20
i
am
crucified
with
christ
neverthless
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
and
the
life
which
i
now
live
in
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
2
21
i
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of
god
for
if
righteousness
come
by
the
law
then
christ
is
dead
in
vain
3
1
o
foolish
galatians
who
hath
bewitched
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
before
whose
eyes
jesus
christ
hath
been
evidently
set
forth
crucified
among
you
3
2
this
only
would
i
learn
of
you
received
ye
the
spirit
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
3
3
are
ye
so
foolish
having
begun
in
the
spirit
are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
flesh
3
4
have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
vain
if
it
be
yet
in
vain
3
5
he
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
spirit
and
worketh
miracles
among
you
doeth
he
it
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
3
6
even
as
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
righteousness
3
7
know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
faith
the
same
are
the
children
of
abraham
3
8
and
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
3
9
so
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
abraham
3
10
for
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
3
11
but
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
evident
for
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
3
12
and
the
law
is
not
of
faith
but
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
3
13
christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
being
made
a
curse
for
us
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
tree
3
14
that
the
blessing
of
abraham
might
come
on
the
gentiles
through
jesus
christ
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
spirit
through
faith
3
15
brethren
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
though
it
be
but
a
man’s
covenant
yet
if
it
be
confirmed
no
man
disannulleth
or
addeth
thereto
3
16
now
to
abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
made
he
saith
not
and
to
seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
one
and
to
thy
seed
which
is
christ
3
17
and
this
i
say
that
the
covenant
that
was
confirmed
before
of
god
in
christ
the
law
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
cannot
disannul
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
effect
3
18
for
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
law
it
is
no
more
of
promise
but
god
gave
it
to
abraham
by
promise
3
19
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
it
was
added
because
of
transgressions
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
and
it
was
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
mediator
3
20
now
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
but
god
is
one
3
21
is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
god
god
forbid
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
law
3
22
but
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
believe
3
23
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
the
law
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
3
24
wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
3
25
but
after
that
faith
is
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
schoolmaster
3
26
for
ye
are
all
the
children
of
god
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
3
27
for
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
christ
have
put
on
christ
3
28
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
there
is
neither
bond
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
for
ye
are
all
one
in
christ
jesus
3
29
and
if
ye
be
christ’s
then
are
ye
abraham’s
seed
and
heirs
according
to
the
promise
4
1
now
i
say
that
the
heir
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant
though
he
be
lord
of
all
4
2
but
is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
4
3
even
so
we
when
we
were
children
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
world
4
4
but
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
made
under
the
law
4
5
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
sons
4
6
and
because
ye
are
sons
god
hath
sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
crying
abba
father
4
7
wherefore
thou
art
no
more
a
servant
but
a
son
and
if
a
son
then
an
heir
of
god
through
christ
4
8
howbeit
then
when
ye
knew
not
god
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
gods
4
9
but
now
after
that
ye
have
known
god
or
rather
are
known
of
god
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage
4
10
ye
observe
days
and
months
and
times
and
years
4
11
i
am
afraid
of
you
lest
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
labour
in
vain
4
12
brethren
i
beseech
you
be
as
i
am
for
i
am
as
ye
are
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
all
4
13
ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
i
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
first
4
14
and
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
not
nor
rejected
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
god
even
as
christ
jesus
4
15
where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
of
for
i
bear
you
record
that
if
it
had
been
possible
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
eyes
and
have
given
them
to
me
4
16
am
i
therefore
become
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
4
17
they
zealously
affect
you
but
not
well
yea
they
would
exclude
you
that
ye
might
affect
them
4
18
but
it
is
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
a
good
thing
and
not
only
when
i
am
present
with
you
4
19
my
little
children
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
until
christ
be
formed
in
you
4
20
i
desire
to
be
present
with
you
now
and
to
change
my
voice
for
i
stand
in
doubt
of
you
4
21
tell
me
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
law
do
ye
not
hear
the
law
4
22
for
it
is
written
that
abraham
had
two
sons
the
one
by
a
bondmaid
the
other
by
a
freewoman
4
23
but
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
flesh
but
he
of
the
freewoman
was
by
promise
4
24
which
things
are
an
allegory
for
these
are
the
two
covenants
the
one
from
the
mount
sinai
which
gendereth
to
bondage
which
is
agar
4
25
for
this
agar
is
mount
sinai
in
arabia
and
answereth
to
jerusalem
which
now
is
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
children
4
26
but
jerusalem
which
is
above
is
free
which
is
the
mother
of
us
all
4
27
for
it
is
written
rejoice
thou
barren
that
bearest
not
break
forth
and
cry
thou
that
travailest
not
for
the
desolate
hath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
husband
4
28
now
we
brethren
as
isaac
was
are
the
children
of
promise
4
29
but
as
then
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
spirit
even
so
it
is
now
4
30
nevertheless
what
saith
the
scripture
cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
freewoman
4
31
so
then
brethren
we
are
not
children
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
free
5
1
stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
free
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
bondage
5
2
behold
i
paul
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
be
circumcised
christ
shall
profit
you
nothing
5
3
for
i
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
circumcised
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
law
5
4
christ
is
become
of
no
effect
unto
you
whosoever
of
you
are
justified
by
the
law
ye
are
fallen
from
grace
5
5
for
we
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
faith
5
6
for
in
jesus
christ
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
thing
nor
uncircumcision
but
faith
which
worketh
by
love
5
7
ye
did
run
well
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
5
8
this
persuasion
cometh
not
of
him
that
calleth
you
5
9
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
5
10
i
have
confidence
in
you
through
the
lord
that
ye
will
be
none
otherwise
minded
but
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whosoever
he
be
5
11
and
i
brethren
if
i
yet
preach
circumcision
why
do
i
yet
suffer
persecution
then
is
the
offence
of
the
cross
ceased
5
12
i
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
you
5
13
for
brethren
ye
have
been
called
unto
liberty
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
but
by
love
serve
one
another
5
14
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
even
in
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
5
15
but
if
ye
bite
and
devour
one
another
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
consumed
one
of
another
5
16
this
i
say
then
walk
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
of
the
flesh
5
17
for
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
so
that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
would
5
18
but
if
ye
be
led
of
the
spirit
ye
are
not
under
the
law
5
19
now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
5
20
idolatry
witchcraft
hatred
variance
emulations
wrath
strife
seditions
heresies
5
21
envyings
murders
drunkenness
revellings
and
such
like
of
the
which
i
tell
you
before
as
i
have
also
told
you
in
time
past
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
5
22
but
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
gentleness
goodness
faith
5
23
meekness
temperance
against
such
there
is
no
law
5
24
and
they
that
are
christ’s
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
lusts
5
25
if
we
live
in
the
spirit
let
us
also
walk
in
the
spirit
5
26
let
us
not
be
desirous
of
vain
glory
provoking
one
another
envying
one
another
6
1
brethren
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
fault
ye
which
are
spiritual
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
considering
thyself
lest
thou
also
be
tempted
6
2
bear
ye
one
another’s
burdens
and
so
fulfil
the
law
of
christ
6
3
for
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
deceiveth
himself
6
4
but
let
every
man
prove
his
own
work
and
then
shall
he
have
rejoicing
in
himself
alone
and
not
in
another
6
5
for
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
burden
6
6
let
him
that
is
taught
in
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
in
all
good
things
6
7
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
for
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
6
8
for
he
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
shall
of
the
spirit
reap
life
everlasting
6
9
and
let
us
not
be
weary
in
well
doing
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
6
10
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
6
11
ye
see
how
large
a
letter
i
have
written
unto
you
with
mine
own
hand
6
12
as
many
as
desire
to
make
a
fair
shew
in
the
flesh
they
constrain
you
to
be
circumcised
only
lest
they
should
suffer
persecution
for
the
cross
of
christ
6
13
for
neither
they
themselves
who
are
circumcised
keep
the
law
but
desire
to
have
you
circumcised
that
they
may
glory
in
your
flesh
6
14
but
god
forbid
that
i
should
glory
save
in
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
the
world
is
crucified
unto
me
and
i
unto
the
world
6
15
for
in
christ
jesus
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
thing
nor
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creature
6
16
and
as
many
as
walk
according
to
this
rule
peace
be
on
them
and
mercy
and
upon
the
israel
of
god
6
17
from
henceforth
let
no
man
trouble
me
for
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
6
18
brethren
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ

with
your

of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
hath
blessed
us
with
all
spiritual
blessings
in
heavenly
places
in
christ
1
4
according
as
he
hath
chosen
us
in
him
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
that
we
should
be
holy
and
without
blame
before
him
in
love
1
5
having
predestinated
us
unto
the
adoption
of
children
by
jesus
christ
to
himself
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
his
will
1
6
to
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
his
grace
wherein
he
hath
made
us
accepted
in
the
beloved
1
7
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
the
forgiveness
of
sins
according
to
the
riches
of
his
grace
1
8
wherein
he
hath
abounded
toward
us
in
all
wisdom
and
prudence
1
9
having
made
known
unto
us
the
mystery
of
his
will
according
to
his
good
pleasure
which
he
hath
purposed
in
himself
1
10
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
he
might
gather
together
in
one
all
things
in
christ
both
which
are
in
heaven
and
which
are
on
earth
even
in
him
1
11
in
whom
also
we
have
obtained
an
inheritance
being
predestinated
according
to
the
purpose
of
him
who
worketh
all
things
after
the
counsel
of
his
own
will
1
12
that
we
should
be
to
the
praise
of
his
glory
who
first
trusted
in
christ
1
13
in
whom
ye
also
trusted
after
that
ye
heard
the
word
of
truth
the
gospel
of
your
salvation
in
whom
also
after
that
ye
believed
ye
were
sealed
with
that
holy
spirit
of
promise
1
14
which
is
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of
the
purchased
possession
unto
the
praise
of
his
glory
1
15
wherefore
i
also
after
i
heard
of
your
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
and
love
unto
all
the
saints
1
16
cease
not
to
give
thanks
for
you
making
mention
of
you
in
my
prayers
1
17
that
the
god
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
father
of
glory
may
give
unto
you
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
revelation
in
the
knowledge
of
him
1
18
the
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
enlightened
that
ye
may
know
what
is
the
hope
of
his
calling
and
what
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
his
inheritance
in
the
saints
1
19
and
what
is
the
exceeding
greatness
of
his
power
to
us-ward
who
believe
according
to
the
working
of
his
mighty
power
1
20
which
he
wrought
in
christ
when
he
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
set
him
at
his
own
right
hand
in
the
heavenly
places
1
21
far
above
all
principality
and
power
and
might
and
dominion
and
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
world
but
also
in
that
which
is
to
come
1
22
and
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
and
gave
him
to
be
the
head
over
all
things
to
the
church
1
23
which
is
his
body
the
fulness
of
him
that
filleth
all
in
all
2
1
and
you
hath
he
quickened
who
were
dead
in
trespasses
and
sins
2
2
wherein
in
time
past
ye
walked
according
to
the
course
of
this
world
according
to
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
spirit
that
now
worketh
in
the
children
of
disobedience
2
3
among
whom
also
we
all
had
our
conversation
in
times
past
in
the
lusts
of
our
flesh
fulfilling
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
mind
and
were
by
nature
the
children
of
wrath
even
as
others
2
4
but
god
who
is
rich
in
mercy
for
his
great
love
wherewith
he
loved
us
2
5
even
when
we
were
dead
in
sins
hath
quickened
us
together
with
christ
(by
grace
ye
are
saved
)
2
6
and
hath
raised
us
up
together
and
made
us
sit
together
in
heavenly
places
in
christ
jesus
2
7
that
in
the
ages
to
come
he
might
shew
the
exceeding
riches
of
his
grace
in
his
kindness
toward
us
through
christ
jesus
2
8
for
by
grace
are
ye
saved
through
faith
and
that
not
of
yourselves
it
is
the
gift
of
god
2
9
not
of
works
lest
any
man
should
boast
2
10
for
we
are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
them
2
11
wherefore
remember
that
ye
being
in
time
past
gentiles
in
the
flesh
who
are
called
uncircumcision
by
that
which
is
called
the
circumcision
in
the
flesh
made
by
hands
2
12
that
at
that
time
ye
were
without
christ
being
aliens
from
the
commonwealth
of
israel
and
strangers
from
the
covenants
of
promise
having
no
hope
and
without
god
in
the
world
2
13
but
now
in
christ
jesus
ye
who
sometimes
were
far
off
are
made
nigh
by
the
blood
of
christ
2
14
for
he
is
our
peace
who
hath
made
both
one
and
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
between
us
2
15
having
abolished
in
his
flesh
the
enmity
even
the
law
of
commandments
contained
in
ordinances
for
to
make
in
himself
of
twain
one
new
man
so
making
peace
2
16
and
that
he
might
reconcile
both
unto
god
in
one
body
by
the
cross
having
slain
the
enmity
thereby
2
17
and
came
and
preached
peace
to
you
which
were
afar
off
and
to
them
that
were
nigh
2
18
for
through
him
we
both
have
access
by
one
spirit
unto
the
father
2
19
now
therefore
ye
are
no
more
strangers
and
foreigners
but
fellowcitizens
with
the
saints
and
of
the
household
of
god
2
20
and
are
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
jesus
christ
himself
being
the
chief
corner
stone
2
21
in
whom
all
the
building
fitly
framed
together
groweth
unto
an
holy
temple
in
the
lord
2
22
in
whom
ye
also
are
builded
together
for
an
habitation
of
god
through
the
spirit
3
1
for
this
cause
i
paul
the
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
for
you
gentiles
3
2
if
ye
have
heard
of
the
dispensation
of
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
me
to
you-ward
3
3
how
that
by
revelation
he
made
known
unto
me
the
mystery
(as
i
wrote
afore
in
few
words
3
4
whereby
when
ye
read
ye
may
understand
my
knowledge
in
the
mystery
of
christ)
3
5
which
in
other
ages
was
not
made
known
unto
the
sons
of
men
as
it
is
now
revealed
unto
his
holy
apostles
and
prophets
by
the
spirit
3
6
that
the
gentiles
should
be
fellowheirs
and
of
the
same
body
and
partakers
of
his
promise
in
christ
by
the
gospel
3
7
whereof
i
was
made
a
minister
according
to
the
gift
of
the
grace
of
god
given
unto
me
by
the
effectual
working
of
his
power
3
8
unto
me
who
am
less
than
the
least
of
all
saints
is
this
grace
given
that
i
should
preach
among
the
gentiles
the
unsearchable
riches
of
christ
3
9
and
to
make
all
men
see
what
is
the
fellowship
of
the
mystery
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
hath
been
hid
in
god
who
created
all
things
by
jesus
christ
3
10
to
the
intent
that
now
unto
the
principalities
and
powers
in
heavenly
places
might
be
known
by
the
church
the
manifold
wisdom
of
god
3
11
according
to
the
eternal
purpose
which
he
purposed
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
3
12
in
whom
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
by
the
faith
of
him
3
13
wherefore
i
desire
that
ye
faint
not
at
my
tribulations
for
you
which
is
your
glory
3
14
for
this
cause
i
bow
my
knees
unto
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
3
15
of
whom
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
is
named
3
16
that
he
would
grant
you
according
to
the
riches
of
his
glory
to
be
strengthened
with
might
by
his
spirit
in
the
inner
man
3
17
that
christ
may
dwell
in
your
hearts
by
faith
that
ye
being
rooted
and
grounded
in
love
3
18
may
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
saints
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
3
19
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
knowledge
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
all
the
fulness
of
god
3
20
now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
do
exceeding
abundantly
above
all
that
we
ask
or
think
according
to
the
power
that
worketh
in
us
3
21
unto
him
be
glory
in
the
church
by
christ
jesus
throughout
all
ages
world
without
end
amen
4
1
i
therefore
the
prisoner
of
the
lord
beseech
you
that
ye
walk
worthy
of
the
vocation
wherewith
ye
are
called
4
2
with
all
lowliness
and
meekness
with
longsuffering
forbearing
one
another
in
love
4
3
endeavouring
to
keep
the
unity
of
the
spirit
in
the
bond
of
peace
4
4
there
is
one
body
and
one
spirit
even
as
ye
are
called
in
one
hope
of
your
calling
4
5
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
4
6
one
god
and
father
of
all
who
is
above
all
and
through
all
and
in
you
all
4
7
but
unto
every
one
of
us
is
given
grace
according
to
the
measure
of
the
gift
of
christ
4
8
wherefore
he
saith
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
and
gave
gifts
unto
men
4
9
(now
that
he
ascended
what
is
it
but
that
he
also
descended
first
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
4
10
he
that
descended
is
the
same
also
that
ascended
up
far
above
all
heavens
that
he
might
fill
all
things
)
4
11
and
he
gave
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
4
12
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
edifying
of
the
body
of
christ
4
13
till
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
man
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fulness
of
christ
4
14
that
we
henceforth
be
no
more
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
sleight
of
men
and
cunning
craftiness
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
4
15
but
speaking
the
truth
in
love
may
grow
up
into
him
in
all
things
which
is
the
head
even
christ
4
16
from
whom
the
whole
body
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
joint
supplieth
according
to
the
effectual
working
in
the
measure
of
every
part
maketh
increase
of
the
body
unto
the
edifying
of
itself
in
love
4
17
this
i
say
therefore
and
testify
in
the
lord
that
ye
henceforth
walk
not
as
other
gentiles
walk
in
the
vanity
of
their
mind
4
18
having
the
understanding
darkened
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
god
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
heart
4
19
who
being
past
feeling
have
given
themselves
over
unto
lasciviousness
to
work
all
uncleanness
with
greediness
4
20
but
ye
have
not
so
learned
christ
4
21
if
so
be
that
ye
have
heard
him
and
have
been
taught
by
him
as
the
truth
is
in
jesus
4
22
that
ye
put
off
concerning
the
former
conversation
the
old
man
which
is
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
lusts
4
23
and
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
mind
4
24
and
that
ye
put
on
the
new
man
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
holiness
4
25
wherefore
putting
away
lying
speak
every
man
truth
with
his
neighbour
for
we
are
members
one
of
another
4
26
be
ye
angry
and
sin
not
let
not
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
wrath
4
27
neither
give
place
to
the
devil
4
28
let
him
that
stole
steal
no
more
but
rather
let
him
labour
working
with
his
hands
the
thing
which
is
good
that
he
may
have
to
give
to
him
that
needeth
4
29
let
no
corrupt
communication
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
but
that
which
is
good
to
the
use
of
edifying
that
it
may
minister
grace
unto
the
hearers
4
30
and
grieve
not
the
holy
spirit
of
god
whereby
ye
are
sealed
unto
the
day
of
redemption
4
31
let
all
bitterness
and
wrath
and
anger
and
clamour
and
evil
speaking
be
put
away
from
you
with
all
malice
4
32
and
be
ye
kind
one
to
another
tenderhearted
forgiving
one
another
even
as
god
for
christ’s
sake
hath
forgiven
you
5
1
be
ye
therefore
followers
of
god
as
dear
children
5
2
and
walk
in
love
as
christ
also
hath
loved
us
and
hath
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
sweetsmelling
savour
5
3
but
fornication
and
all
uncleanness
or
covetousness
let
it
not
be
once
named
among
you
as
becometh
saints
5
4
neither
filthiness
nor
foolish
talking
nor
jesting
which
are
not
convenient
but
rather
giving
of
thanks
5
5
for
this
ye
know
that
no
whoremonger
nor
unclean
person
nor
covetous
man
who
is
an
idolater
hath
any
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
and
of
god
5
6
let
no
man
deceive
you
with
vain
words
for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
5
7
be
not
ye
therefore
partakers
with
them
5
8
for
ye
were
sometimes
darkness
but
now
are
ye
light
in
the
lord
walk
as
children
of
light
5
9
(for
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
)
5
10
proving
what
is
acceptable
unto
the
lord
5
11
and
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
of
darkness
but
rather
reprove
them
5
12
for
it
is
a
shame
even
to
speak
of
those
things
which
are
done
of
them
in
secret
5
13
but
all
things
that
are
reproved
are
made
manifest
by
the
light
for
whatsoever
doth
make
manifest
is
light
5
14
wherefore
he
saith
awake
thou
that
sleepest
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
christ
shall
give
thee
light
5
15
see
then
that
ye
walk
circumspectly
not
as
fools
but
as
wise
5
16
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
are
evil
5
17
wherefore
be
ye
not
unwise
but
understanding
what
the
will
of
the
lord
is
5
18
and
be
not
drunk
with
wine
wherein
is
excess
but
be
filled
with
the
spirit
5
19
speaking
to
yourselves
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
singing
and
making
melody
in
your
heart
to
the
lord
5
20
giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
unto
god
and
the
father
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
5
21
submitting
yourselves
one
to
another
in
the
fear
of
god
5
22
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
5
23
for
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
and
he
is
the
saviour
of
the
body
5
24
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
every
thing
5
25
husbands
love
your
wives
even
as
christ
also
loved
the
church
and
gave
himself
for
it
5
26
that
he
might
sanctify
and
cleanse
it
with
the
washing
of
water
by
the
word
5
27
that
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
thing
but
that
it
should
be
holy
and
without
blemish
5
28
so
ought
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
he
that
loveth
his
wife
loveth
himself
5
29
for
no
man
ever
yet
hated
his
own
flesh
but
nourisheth
and
cherisheth
it
even
as
the
lord
the
church
5
30
for
we
are
members
of
his
body
of
his
flesh
and
of
his
bones
5
31
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
be
joined
unto
his
wife
and
they
two
shall
be
one
flesh
5
32
this
is
a
great
mystery
but
i
speak
concerning
christ
and
the
church
5
33
nevertheless
let
every
one
of
you
in
particular
so
love
his
wife
even
as
himself
and
the
wife
see
that
she
reverence
her
husband
6
1
children
obey
your
parents
in
the
lord
for
this
is
right
6
2
honour
thy
father
and
mother
which
is
the
first
commandment
with
promise
6
3
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
thou
mayest
live
long
on
the
earth
6
4
and
ye
fathers
provoke
not
your
children
to
wrath
but
bring
them
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
6
5
servants
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
with
fear
and
trembling
in
singleness
of
your
heart
as
unto
christ
6
6
not
with
eyeservice
as
menpleasers
but
as
the
servants
of
christ
doing
the
will
of
god
from
the
heart
6
7
with
good
will
doing
service
as
to
the
lord
and
not
to
men
6
8
knowing
that
whatsoever
good
thing
any
man
doeth
the
same
shall
he
receive
of
the
lord
whether
he
be
bond
or
free
6
9
and
ye
masters
do
the
same
things
unto
them
forbearing
threatening
knowing
that
your
master
also
is
in
heaven
neither
is
there
respect
of
persons
with
him
6
10
finally
my
brethren
be
strong
in
the
lord
and
in
the
power
of
his
might
6
11
put
on
the
whole
armour
of
god
that
ye
may
be
able
to
stand
against
the
wiles
of
the
devil
6
12
for
we
wrestle
not
against
flesh
and
blood
but
against
principalities
against
powers
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
world
against
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places
6
13
wherefore
take
unto
you
the
whole
armour
of
god
that
ye

above
all
taking
the
shield
of
faith
wherewith
ye
shall
be
able
to
quench
all
the
fiery
darts
of
the
wicked
6
17
and
take
the
helmet
of
salvation
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
word
of
god

for
me

unto
me
that
i
may
open
my
mouth
boldly
to
make
known
the
mystery
of
the
gospel
6
20
for
which
i
am
an
ambassador
in
bonds
that
therein
i
may
speak
boldly
as
i
ought
to
speak

but
that
ye
also
may
know
my
affairs
and
how
i
do

a
beloved

you
all
things

i
have
sent
unto
you
for
the

purpose
that
ye
might

comfort
your
hearts

grace

and

from

from

1
3
i
thank
my
god
upon
every
remembrance
of
you
1
4
always
in
every
prayer
of
mine
for
you
all
making
request
with
joy
1
5
for
your
fellowship
in
the
gospel
from
the
first
day
until
now
1
6
being
confident
of
this
very
thing
that
he
which
hath
begun
a
good
work
in
you
will
perform
it
until
the
day
of
jesus
christ
1
7
even
as
it
is
meet
for
me
to
think
this
of
you
all
because
i
have
you
in
my
heart
inasmuch
as
both
in
my
bonds
and
in
the
defence
and
confirmation
of
the
gospel
ye
all
are
partakers
of
my
grace
1
8
for
god
is
my
record
how
greatly
i
long
after
you
all
in
the
bowels
of
jesus
christ
1
9
and
this
i
pray
that
your
love
may
abound
yet
more
and
more
in
knowledge
and
in
all
judgment
1
10
that
ye
may
approve
things
that
are
excellent
that
ye
may
be
sincere
and
without
offence
till
the
day
of
christ
1
11
being
filled
with
the
fruits
of
righteousness
which
are
by
jesus
christ
unto
the
glory
and
praise
of
god
1
12
but
i
would
ye
should
understand
brethren
that
the
things
which
happened
unto
me
have
fallen
out
rather
unto
the
furtherance
of
the
gospel
1
13
so
that
my
bonds
in
christ
are
manifest
in
all
the
palace
and
in
all
other
places
1
14
and
many
of
the
brethren
in
the
lord
waxing
confident
by
my
bonds
are
much
more
bold
to
speak
the
word
without
fear
1
15
some
indeed
preach
christ
even
of
envy
and
strife
and
some
also
of
good
will
1
16
the
one
preach
christ
of
contention
not
sincerely
supposing
to
add
affliction
to
my
bonds
1
17
but
the
other
of
love
knowing
that
i
am
set
for
the
defence
of
the
gospel
1
18
what
then
notwithstanding
every
way
whether
in
pretence
or
in
truth
christ
is
preached
and
i
therein
do
rejoice
yea
and
will
rejoice
1
19
for
i
know
that
this
shall
turn
to
my
salvation
through
your
prayer
and
the
supply
of
the
spirit
of
jesus
christ
1
20
according
to
my
earnest
expectation
and
my
hope
that
in
nothing
i
shall
be
ashamed
but
that
with
all
boldness
as
always
so
now
also
christ
shall
be
magnified
in
my
body
whether
it
be
by
life
or
by
death
1
21
for
to
me
to
live
is
christ
and
to
die
is
gain
1
22
but
if
i
live
in
the
flesh
this
is
the
fruit
of
my
labour
yet
what
i
shall
choose
i
wot
not
1
23
for
i
am
in
a
strait
betwixt
two
having
a
desire
to
depart
and
to
be
with
christ
which
is
far
better
1
24
nevertheless
to
abide
in
the
flesh
is
more
needful
for
you
1
25
and
having
this
confidence
i
know
that
i
shall
abide
and
continue
with
you
all
for
your
furtherance
and
joy
of
faith
1
26
that
your
rejoicing
may
be
more
abundant
in
jesus
christ
for
me
by
my
coming
to
you
again
1
27
only
let
your
conversation
be
as
it
becometh
the
gospel
of
christ
that
whether
i
come
and
see
you
or
else
be
absent
i
may
hear
of
your
affairs
that
ye
stand
fast
in
one
spirit
with
one
mind
striving
together
for
the
faith
of
the
gospel
1
28
and
in
nothing
terrified
by
your
adversaries
which
is
to
them
an
evident
token
of
perdition
but
to
you
of
salvation
and
that
of
god
1
29
for
unto
you
it
is
given
in
the
behalf
of
christ
not
only
to
believe
on
him
but
also
to
suffer
for
his
sake
1
30
having
the
same
conflict
which
ye
saw
in
me
and
now
hear
to
be
in
me
2
1
if
there
be
therefore
any
consolation
in
christ
if
any
comfort
of
love
if
any
fellowship
of
the
spirit
if
any
bowels
and
mercies
2
2
fulfil
ye
my
joy
that
ye
be
likeminded
having
the
same
love
being
of
one
accord
of
one
mind
2
3
let
nothing
be
done
through
strife
or
vainglory
but
in
lowliness
of
mind
let
each
esteem
other
better
than
themselves
2
4
look
not
every
man
on
his
own
things
but
every
man
also
on
the
things
of
others
2
5
let
this
mind
be
in
you
which
was
also
in
christ
jesus
2
6
who
being
in
the
form
of
god
thought
it
not
robbery
to
be
equal
with
god
2
7
but
made
himself
of
no
reputation
and
took
upon
him
the
form
of
a
servant
and
was
made
in
the
likeness
of
men
2
8
and
being
found
in
fashion
as
a
man
he
humbled
himself
and
became
obedient
unto
death
even
the
death
of
the
cross
2
9
wherefore
god
also
hath
highly
exalted
him
and
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
name
2
10
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
bow
of
things
in
heaven
and
things
in
earth
and
things
under
the
earth
2
11
and
that
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
2
12
wherefore
my
beloved
as
ye
have
always
obeyed
not
as
in
my
presence
only
but
now
much
more
in
my
absence
work
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
2
13
for
it
is
god
which
worketh
in
you
both
to
will
and
to
do
of
his
good
pleasure
2
14
do
all
things
without
murmurings
and
disputings
2
15
that
ye
may
be
blameless
and
harmless
the
sons
of
god
without
rebuke
in
the
midst
of
a
crooked
and
perverse
nation
among
whom
ye
shine
as
lights
in
the
world
2
16
holding
forth
the
word
of
life
that
i
may
rejoice
in
the
day
of
christ
that
i
have
not
run
in
vain
neither
laboured
in
vain
2
17
yea
and
if
i
be
offered
upon
the
sacrifice
and
service
of
your
faith
i
joy
and
rejoice
with
you
all
2
18
for
the
same
cause
also
do
ye
joy
and
rejoice
with
me
2
19
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
jesus
to
send
timotheus
shortly
unto
you
that
i
also
may
be
of
good
comfort
when
i
know
your
state
2
20
for
i
have
no
man
likeminded
who
will
naturally
care
for
your
state
2
21
for
all
seek
their
own
not
the
things
which
are
jesus
christ’s
2
22
but
ye
know
the
proof
of
him
that
as
a
son
with
the
father
he
hath
served
with
me
in
the
gospel
2
23
him
therefore
i
hope
to
send
presently
so
soon
as
i
shall
see
how
it
will
go
with
me
2
24
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
that
i
also
myself
shall
come
shortly
2
25
yet
i
supposed
it
necessary
to
send
to
you
epaphroditus
my
brother
and
companion
in
labour
and
fellowsoldier
but
your
messenger
and
he
that
ministered
to
my
wants
2
26
for
he
longed
after
you
all
and
was
full
of
heaviness
because
that
ye
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick
2
27
for
indeed
he
was
sick
nigh
unto
death
but
god
had
mercy
on
him
and
not
on
him
only
but
on
me
also
lest
i
should
have
sorrow
upon
sorrow
2
28
i
sent
him
therefore
the
more
carefully
that
when
ye
see
him
again
ye
may
rejoice
and
that
i
may
be
the
less
sorrowful
2
29
receive
him
therefore
in
the
lord
with
all
gladness
and
hold
such
in
reputation
2
30
because
for
the
work
of
christ
he
was
nigh
unto
death
not
regarding
his
life
to
supply
your
lack
of
service
toward
me
3
1
finally
my
brethren
rejoice
in
the
lord
to
write
the
same
things
to
you
to
me
indeed
is
not
grievous
but
for
you
it
is
safe
3
2
beware
of
dogs
beware
of
evil
workers
beware
of
the
concision
3
3
for
we
are
the
circumcision
which
worship
god
in
the
spirit
and
rejoice
in
christ
jesus
and
have
no
confidence
in
the
flesh
3
4
though
i
might
also
have
confidence
in
the
flesh
if
any
other
man
thinketh
that
he
hath
whereof
he
might
trust
in
the
flesh
i
more
3
5
circumcised
the
eighth
day
of
the
stock
of
israel
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
an
hebrew
of
the
hebrews
as
touching
the
law
a
pharisee
3
6
concerning
zeal
persecuting
the
church
touching
the
righteousness
which
is
in
the
law
blameless
3
7
but
what
things
were
gain
to
me
those
i
counted
loss
for
christ
3
8
yea
doubtless
and
i
count
all
things
but
loss
for
the
excellency
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
jesus
my
lord
for
whom
i
have
suffered
the
loss
of
all
things
and
do
count
them
but
dung
that
i
may
win
christ
3
9
and
be
found
in
him
not
having
mine
own
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
but
that
which
is
through
the
faith
of
christ
the
righteousness
which
is
of
god
by
faith
3
10
that
i
may
know
him
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
and
the
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
being
made
conformable
unto
his
death
3
11
if
by
any
means
i
might
attain
unto
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
3
12
not
as
though
i
had
already
attained
either
were
already
perfect
but
i
follow
after
if
that
i
may
apprehend
that
for
which
also
i
am
apprehended
of
christ
jesus
3
13
brethren
i
count
not
myself
to
have
apprehended
but
this
one
thing
i
do
forgetting
those
things
which
are
behind
and
reaching
forth
unto
those
things
which
are
before
3
14
i
press
toward
the
mark
for
the
prize
of
the
high
calling
of
god
in
christ
jesus
3
15
let
us
therefore
as
many
as
be
perfect
be
thus
minded
and
if
in
any
thing
ye
be
otherwise
minded
god
shall
reveal
even
this
unto
you
3
16
nevertheless
whereto
we
have
already
attained
let
us
walk
by
the
same
rule
let
us
mind
the
same
thing
3
17
brethren
be
followers
together
of
me
and
mark
them
which
walk
so
as
ye
have
us
for
an
ensample
3
18
(for
many
walk
of
whom
i
have
told
you
often
and
now
tell
you
even
weeping
that
they
are
the
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
3
19
whose
end
is
destruction
whose
god
is
their
belly
and
whose
glory
is
in
their
shame
who
mind
earthly
things
)
3
20
for
our
conversation
is
in
heaven
from
whence
also
we
look
for
the
saviour
the
lord
jesus
christ
3
21
who
shall
change
our
vile
body
that
it
may
be
fashioned
like
unto
his
glorious
body
according
to
the
working
whereby
he
is
able
even
to
subdue
all
things
unto
himself
4
1
therefore
my
brethren
dearly
beloved
and
longed
for
my
joy
and
crown
so
stand
fast
in
the
lord
my
dearly
beloved
4
2
i
beseech
euodias
and
beseech
syntyche
that
they
be
of
the
same
mind
in
the
lord
4
3
and
i
intreat
thee
also
true
yokefellow
help
those
women
which
laboured
with
me
in
the
gospel
with
clement
also
and
with
other
my
fellowlabourers
whose
names
are
in
the
book
of
life
4
4
rejoice
in
the
lord
alway
and
again
i
say
rejoice
4
5
let
your
moderation
be
known
unto
all
men
the
lord
is
at
hand
4
6
be
careful
for
nothing
but
in
every
thing
by
prayer
and
supplication
with
thanksgiving
let
your
requests
be
made
known
unto
god
4
7
and
the
peace
of
god
which
passeth
all
understanding
shall
keep
your
hearts
and
minds
through
christ
jesus
4
8
finally
brethren
whatsoever
things
are
true
whatsoever
things
are
honest
whatsoever
things
are
just
whatsoever
things
are
pure
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
whatsoever
things
are
of
good
report
if
there
be
any
virtue
and
if
there
be
any
praise
think
on
these
things
4
9
those
things
which
ye
have
both
learned
and
received
and
heard
and
seen
in
me
do
and
the
god
of
peace
shall
be
with
you
4
10
but
i
rejoiced
in
the
lord
greatly
that
now
at
the
last
your
care
of
me
hath
flourished
again
wherein
ye
were
also
careful
but
ye
lacked
opportunity
4
11
not
that
i
speak
in
respect
of
want
for
i
have
learned
in
whatsoever
state
i
am
therewith
to
be
content
4
12
i
know
both
how
to
be
abased
and
i
know
how
to
abound
every
where
and
in
all
things
i
am
instructed
both
to
be
full
and
to
be
hungry
both
to
abound
and
to
suffer
need
4
13
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
which
strengtheneth
me
4
14
notwithstanding
ye
have
well
done
that
ye
did
communicate
with
my
affliction
4
15
now
ye
philippians
know
also
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
gospel
when
i
departed
from
macedonia
no
church
communicated
with
me
as
concerning
giving
and
receiving
but
ye
only
4
16
for
even
in
thessalonica
ye
sent
once
and
again
unto
my
necessity
4
17
not
because
i
desire
a
gift
but
i
desire
fruit
that
may
abound
to
your
account
4
18
but
i
have
all
and
abound
i
am
full
having
received
of
epaphroditus
the
things
which
were
sent
from
you
an
odour
of
a
sweet
smell
a
sacrifice
acceptable
wellpleasing
to
god
4
19
but
my
god
shall
supply
all
your
need
according
to
his
riches
in
glory
by
christ
jesus
4
20
now
unto
god

praying
always
for
you
1

since
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
jesus
and
of
the
love
which
ye
have
to
all
the
saints
1
5
for
the
hope
which
is
laid
up
for
you
in
heaven
whereof
ye
heard
before
in
the
word
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
1
6
which
is
come
unto
you
as
it
is
in
all
the
world
and
bringeth
forth
fruit
as
it
doth
also
in
you
since
the
day
ye
heard
of
it
and
knew
the
grace
of
god
in
truth
1
7
as
ye
also
learned
of
epaphras
our
dear
fellowservant
who
is
for
you
a
faithful
minister
of
christ
1
8
who
also
declared
unto
us
your
love
in
the
spirit
1
9
for
this
cause
we
also
since
the
day
we
heard
it
do
not
cease
to
pray
for
you
and
to
desire
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
his
will
in
all
wisdom
and
spiritual
understanding
1
10
that
ye
might
walk
worthy
of
the
lord
unto
all
pleasing
being
fruitful
in
every
good
work
and
increasing
in
the
knowledge
of
god
1
11
strengthened
with
all
might
according
to
his
glorious
power
unto
all
patience
and
longsuffering
with
joyfulness
1
12
giving
thanks
unto
the
father
which
hath
made
us
meet
to
be
partakers
of
the
inheritance
of
the
saints
in
light
1
13
who
hath
delivered
us
from
the
power
of
darkness
and
hath
translated
us
into
the
kingdom
of
his
dear
son
1
14
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
even
the
forgiveness
of
sins
1
15
who
is
the
image
of
the
invisible
god
the
firstborn
of
every
creature
1
16
for
by
him
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
whether
they
be
thrones
or
dominions
or
principalities
or
powers
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
1
17
and
he
is
before
all
things
and
by
him
all
things
consist
1
18
and
he
is
the
head
of
the
body
the
church
who
is
the
beginning
the
firstborn
from
the
dead
that
in
all
things
he
might
have
the
preeminence
1
19
for
it
pleased
the
father
that
in
him
should
all
fulness
dwell
1
20
and
having
made
peace
through
the
blood
of
his
cross
by
him
to
reconcile
all
things
unto
himself
by
him
i
say
whether
they
be
things
in
earth
or
things
in
heaven
1
21
and
you
that
were
sometime
alienated
and
enemies
in
your
mind
by
wicked
works
yet
now
hath
he
reconciled
1
22
in
the
body
of
his
flesh
through
death
to
present
you
holy
and
unblameable
and
unreproveable
in
his
sight
1
23
if
ye
continue
in
the
faith
grounded
and
settled
and
be
not
moved
away
from
the
hope
of
the
gospel
which
ye
have
heard
and
which
was
preached
to
every
creature
which
is
under
heaven
whereof
i
paul
am
made
a
minister
1
24
who
now
rejoice
in
my
sufferings
for
you
and
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
in
my
flesh
for
his
body’s
sake
which
is
the
church
1
25
whereof
i
am
made
a
minister
according
to
the
dispensation
of
god
which
is
given
to
me
for
you
to
fulfil
the
word
of
god
1
26
even
the
mystery
which
hath
been
hid
from
ages
and
from
generations
but
now
is
made
manifest
to
his
saints
1
27
to
whom
god
would
make
known
what
is
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
this
mystery
among
the
gentiles
which
is
christ
in
you
the
hope
of
glory
1
28
whom
we
preach
warning
every
man
and
teaching
every
man
in
all
wisdom
that
we
may
present
every
man
perfect
in
christ
jesus
1
29
whereunto
i
also
labour
striving
according
to
his
working
which
worketh
in
me
mightily
2
1
for
i
would
that
ye
knew
what
great
conflict
i
have
for
you
and
for
them
at
laodicea
and
for
as
many
as
have
not
seen
my
face
in
the
flesh
2
2
that
their
hearts
might
be
comforted
being
knit
together
in
love
and
unto
all
riches
of
the
full
assurance
of
understanding
to
the
acknowledgement
of
the
mystery
of
god
and
of
the
father
and
of
christ
2
3
in
whom
are
hid
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
2
4
and
this
i
say
lest
any
man
should
beguile
you
with
enticing
words
2
5
for
though
i
be
absent
in
the
flesh
yet
am
i
with
you
in
the
spirit
joying
and
beholding
your
order
and
the
stedfastness
of
your
faith
in
christ
2
6
as
ye
have
therefore
received
christ
jesus
the
lord
so
walk
ye
in
him
2
7
rooted
and
built
up
in
him
and
stablished
in
the
faith
as
ye
have
been
taught
abounding
therein
with
thanksgiving
2
8
beware
lest
any
man
spoil
you
through
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
after
the
tradition
of
men
after
the
rudiments
of
the
world
and
not
after
christ
2
9
for
in
him
dwelleth
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
bodily
2
10
and
ye
are
complete
in
him
which
is
the
head
of
all
principality
and
power
2
11
in
whom
also
ye
are
circumcised
with
the
circumcision
made
without
hands
in
putting
off
the
body
of
the
sins
of
the
flesh
by
the
circumcision
of
christ
2
12
buried
with
him
in
baptism
wherein
also
ye
are
risen
with
him
through
the
faith
of
the
operation
of
god
who
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
2
13
and
you
being
dead
in
your
sins
and
the
uncircumcision
of
your
flesh
hath
he
quickened
together
with
him
having
forgiven
you
all
trespasses
2
14
blotting
out
the
handwriting
of
ordinances
that
was
against
us
which
was
contrary
to
us
and
took
it
out
of
the
way
nailing
it
to
his
cross
2
15
and
having
spoiled
principalities
and
powers
he
made
a
shew
of
them
openly
triumphing
over
them
in
it
2
16
let
no
man
therefore
judge
you
in
meat
or
in
drink
or
in
respect
of
an
holyday
or
of
the
new
moon
or
of
the
sabbath
days
2
17
which
are
a
shadow
of
things
to
come
but
the
body
is
of
christ
2
18
let
no
man
beguile
you
of
your
reward
in
a
voluntary
humility
and
worshipping
of
angels
intruding
into
those
things
which
he
hath
not
seen
vainly
puffed
up
by
his
fleshly
mind
2
19
and
not
holding
the
head
from
which
all
the
body
by
joints
and
bands
having
nourishment
ministered
and
knit
together
increaseth
with
the
increase
of
god
2
20
wherefore
if
ye
be
dead
with
christ
from
the
rudiments
of
the
world
why
as
though
living
in
the
world
are
ye
subject
to
ordinances
2
21
(touch
not
taste
not
handle
not
2
22
which
all
are
to
perish
with
the
using
)
after
the
commandments
and
doctrines
of
men
2
23
which
things
have
indeed
a
shew
of
wisdom
in
will
worship
and
humility
and
neglecting
of
the
body
not
in
any
honour
to
the
satisfying
of
the
flesh
3
1
if
ye
then
be
risen
with
christ
seek
those
things
which
are
above
where
christ
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
god
3
2
set
your
affection
on
things
above
not
on
things
on
the
earth
3
3
for
ye
are
dead
and
your
life
is
hid
with
christ
in
god
3
4
when
christ
who
is
our
life
shall
appear
then
shall
ye
also
appear
with
him
in
glory
3
5
mortify
therefore
your
members
which
are
upon
the
earth
fornication
uncleanness
inordinate
affection
evil
concupiscence
and
covetousness
which
is
idolatry
3
6
for
which
things’
sake
the
wrath
of
god
cometh
on
the
children
of
disobedience
3
7
in
the
which
ye
also
walked
some
time
when
ye
lived
in
them
3
8
but
now
ye
also
put
off
all
these
anger
wrath
malice
blasphemy
filthy
communication
out
of
your
mouth
3
9
lie
not
one
to
another
seeing
that
ye
have
put
off
the
old
man
with
his
deeds
3
10
and
have
put
on
the
new
man
which
is
renewed
in
knowledge
after
the
image
of
him
that
created
him
3
11
where
there
is
neither
greek
nor
jew
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
barbarian
scythian
bond
nor
free
but
christ
is
all
and
in
all
3
12
put
on
therefore
as
the
elect
of
god
holy
and
beloved
bowels
of
mercies
kindness
humbleness
of
mind
meekness
longsuffering
3
13
forbearing
one
another
and
forgiving
one
another
if
any
man
have
a
quarrel
against
any
even
as
christ
forgave
you
so
also
do
ye
3
14
and
above
all
these
things
put
on
charity
which
is
the
bond
of
perfectness
3
15
and
let
the
peace
of
god
rule
in
your
hearts
to
the
which
also
ye
are
called
in
one
body
and
be
ye
thankful
3
16
let
the
word
of
christ
dwell
in
you
richly
in
all
wisdom
teaching
and
admonishing
one
another
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
singing
with
grace
in
your
hearts
to
the
lord
3
17
and
whatsoever
ye
do
in
word
or
deed
do
all
in
the

of
the

is

and
whatsoever
ye
do
do
it
heartily
as
to
the

and
not
unto

3

knowing
that
of
the
lord
ye
shall
receive
the
reward
of
the
inheritance
for
ye
serve
the
lord

3
25
but
he
that

for

done

continue
in

and

in
the

with
thanksgiving
4

withal
praying
also
for
us
that
god
would
open
unto
us
a
door
of
utterance
to
speak
the
mystery
of

for
which

love
and
patience
of
hope
in
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
the
sight
of

and
our
father
1
4
knowing
brethren
beloved
your
election
of
god
1
5
for
our
gospel
came
not
unto
you
in
word
only
but
also
in
power
and
in
the
holy
ghost
and
in
much
assurance
as
ye
know
what
manner
of
men
we
were
among
you
for
your
sake
1
6
and
ye
became
followers
of
us
and
of
the
lord
having
received
the
word
in
much
affliction
with
joy
of
the
holy
ghost
1
7
so
that
ye
were
ensamples
to
all
that
believe
in
macedonia
and
achaia
1
8
for
from
you
sounded
out
the
word
of
the
lord
not
only
in
macedonia
and
achaia
but
also
in
every
place
your
faith
to
god-ward
is
spread
abroad
so
that
we
need
not
to
speak
any
thing
1
9
for
they
themselves
shew
of
us
what
manner
of
entering
in
we
had
unto
you
and
how
ye
turned
to
god
from
idols
to
serve
the
living
and
true
god
1
10
and
to
wait
for
his
son
from
heaven
whom
he
raised
from
the
dead
even
jesus
which
delivered
us
from
the
wrath
to
come
2
1
for
yourselves
brethren
know
our
entrance
in
unto
you
that
it
was
not
in
vain
2
2
but
even
after
that
we
had
suffered
before
and
were
shamefully
entreated
as
ye
know
at
philippi
we
were
bold
in
our
god
to
speak
unto
you
the
gospel
of
god
with
much
contention
2
3
for
our
exhortation
was
not
of
deceit
nor
of
uncleanness
nor
in
guile

but
as
we
were
allowed
of
god
to
be
put
in
trust
with
the
gospel
even
so
we
speak
not
as
pleasing
men
but
god
which
trieth
our
hearts
2
5
for
neither
at
any
time
used
we
flattering
words
as
ye
know
nor
a
cloke
of
covetousness
god
is
witness
2
6
nor
of
men
sought
we
glory
neither
of
you
nor
yet
of
others
when
we
might
have
been
burdensome
as
the
apostles
of
christ
2
7
but
we
were
gentle
among
you
even
as
a
nurse
cherisheth
her
children
2
8
so
being
affectionately
desirous
of
you
we
were
willing
to
have
imparted
unto
you
not
the
gospel
of
god
only
but
also
our
own
souls
because
ye
were
dear
unto
us
2
9
for
ye
remember
brethren
our
labour
and
travail
for
labouring
night
and
day
because
we
would
not
be
chargeable
unto
any
of
you
we
preached
unto
you
the
gospel
of
god
2
10
ye
are
witnesses
and
god
also
how
holily
and
justly
and
unblameably
we
behaved
ourselves
among
you
that
believe
2
11
as
ye
know
how
we
exhorted
and
comforted
and
charged
every
one
of
you
as
a
father
doth
his
children
2
12
that
ye
would
walk
worthy
of
god
who
hath
called
you
unto
his
kingdom
and
glory
2
13
for
this
cause
also
thank
we
god
without
ceasing
because
when
ye
received
the
word
of
god
which
ye
heard
of
us
ye
received
it
not
as
the
word
of
men
but
as
it
is
in
truth
the
word
of
god
which
effectually
worketh
also
in
you
that
believe
2
14
for
ye
brethren
became
followers
of
the
churches
of
god
which
in
judaea
are
in
christ
jesus
for
ye
also
have
suffered
like
things
of
your
own
countrymen
even
as
they
have
of
the
jews
2
15
who
both
killed
the
lord
jesus
and
their
own
prophets
and
have
persecuted
us
and
they
please
not
god
and
are
contrary
to
all
men
2
16
forbidding
us
to
speak
to
the
gentiles
that
they
might
be
saved
to
fill
up
their
sins
alway
for
the
wrath
is
come
upon
them
to
the
uttermost
2
17
but
we
brethren
being
taken
from
you
for
a
short
time
in
presence
not
in
heart
endeavoured
the
more
abundantly
to
see
your
face
with
great
desire
2
18
wherefore
we
would
have
come
unto
you
even
i
paul
once
and
again
but
satan
hindered
us
2
19
for
what
is
our
hope
or
joy
or
crown
of
rejoicing
are
not
even
ye
in
the
presence
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
at
his
coming
2
20
for
ye
are
our
glory
and
joy
3
1
wherefore
when
we
could
no
longer
forbear
we
thought
it
good
to
be
left
at
athens
alone
3
2
and
sent
timotheus
our
brother
and
minister
of
god
and
our
fellowlabourer
in
the
gospel
of
christ
to
establish
you
and
to
comfort
you
concerning
your
faith
3
3
that
no
man
should
be
moved
by
these
afflictions
for
yourselves
know
that
we
are
appointed
thereunto
3
4
for
verily
when
we
were
with
you
we
told
you
before
that
we
should
suffer
tribulation
even
as
it
came
to
pass
and
ye
know
3
5
for
this
cause
when
i
could
no
longer
forbear
i
sent
to
know
your
faith
lest
by
some
means
the
tempter
have
tempted
you
and
our
labour
be
in
vain
3
6
but
now
when
timotheus
came
from
you
unto
us
and
brought
us
good
tidings
of
your
faith
and
charity
and
that
ye
have
good
remembrance
of
us
always
desiring
greatly
to
see
us
as
we
also
to
see
you
3
7
therefore
brethren
we
were
comforted
over
you
in
all
our
affliction
and
distress
by
your
faith
3
8
for
now
we
live
if
ye
stand
fast
in
the
lord
3
9
for
what
thanks
can
we
render
to
god
again
for
you
for
all
the
joy
wherewith
we
joy
for
your
sakes
before
our
god
3
10
night
and
day
praying
exceedingly
that
we
might
see
your
face
and
might
perfect
that
which
is
lacking
in
your
faith
3
11
now
god
himself
and
our
father
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
direct
our
way
unto
you
3
12
and
the
lord
make
you
to
increase
and
abound
in
love
one
toward
another
and
toward
all
men
even
as
we
do
toward
you
3
13
to
the
end
he
may
stablish
your
hearts
unblameable
in
holiness
before
god
even
our
father
at
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
with
all
his
saints
4
1
furthermore
then
we
beseech
you
brethren
and
exhort
you
by
the
lord
jesus
that
as
ye
have
received
of
us
how
ye
ought
to
walk
and
to
please
god
so
ye
would
abound
more
and
more
4
2
for
ye
know
what
commandments
we
gave
you
by
the
lord
jesus
4
3
for
this
is
the
will
of
god
even
your
sanctification
that
ye
should
abstain
from
fornication
4
4
that
every
one
of
you
should
know
how
to
possess
his
vessel
in
sanctification
and
honour
4
5
not
in
the
lust
of
concupiscence
even
as
the
gentiles
which
know
not
god
4
6
that
no
man
go
beyond
and
defraud
his
brother
in
any
matter
because
that
the
lord
is
the
avenger
of
all
such
as
we
also
have
forewarned
you
and
testified
4
7
for
god
hath
not
called
us
unto
uncleanness
but
unto
holiness
4
8
he
therefore
that
despiseth
despiseth
not
man
but
god
who
hath
also
given
unto
us
his
holy
spirit
4
9
but
as
touching
brotherly
love
ye
need
not
that
i
write
unto
you
for
ye
yourselves
are
taught
of
god
to
love
one
another
4
10
and
indeed
ye
do
it
toward
all
the
brethren
which
are
in
all
macedonia
but
we
beseech
you
brethren
that
ye
increase
more
and
more
4
11
and
that
ye
study
to
be
quiet
and
to
do
your
own
business
and
to
work
with
your
own
hands
as
we
commanded
you
4
12
that
ye
may
walk
honestly
toward
them
that
are
without
and
that
ye
may
have
lack
of
nothing
4
13
but
i
would
not
have
you
to
be
ignorant
brethren
concerning
them
which
are
asleep
that
ye
sorrow
not
even
as
others
which
have
no
hope
4
14
for
if
we
believe
that
jesus
died
and
rose
again
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
jesus
will
god
bring
with
him
4
15
for
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
asleep
4
16
for
the
lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
shout
with
the
voice
of
the
archangel
and
with
the
trump
of
god
and
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
4
17
then
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
lord
4
18
wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
words
5
1
but
of
the
times
and
the
seasons
brethren
ye
have
no
need
that
i
write
unto
you
5
2
for
yourselves
know
perfectly
that
the
day
of
the
lord
so
cometh
as
a
thief
in
the
night
5
3
for
when
they
shall
say
peace
and
safety
then
sudden
destruction
cometh
upon
them
as
travail
upon
a
woman
with
child
and
they
shall
not
escape
5
4
but
ye
brethren
are
not
in
darkness
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
as
a
thief
5
5
ye
are
all
the
children
of
light
and
the
children
of
the
day
we
are
not
of
the
night
nor
of
darkness
5
6
therefore
let
us
not
sleep
as
do
others
but
let
us
watch
and
be
sober
5
7
for
they
that
sleep
sleep
in
the
night
and
they
that
be
drunken
are
drunken
in
the
night
5
8
but
let
us
who
are
of
the
day
be
sober
putting
on
the
breastplate
of
faith
and
love
and
for
an
helmet
the
hope
of
salvation
5
9
for
god
hath
not
appointed
us
to
wrath
but
to
obtain
salvation
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
5
10
who
died
for
us
that
whether
we
wake
or
sleep
we
should
live
together
with
him
5
11
wherefore
comfort
yourselves
together
and
edify
one
another
even
as
also
ye
do
5
12
and
we
beseech
you
brethren
to
know
them
which
labour
among
you
and
are
over
you
in
the
lord
and
admonish
you
5
13
and
to
esteem
them
very
highly
in
love
for
their
work’s
sake
and
be
at
peace
among
yourselves
5
14
now
we
exhort
you
brethren
warn
them
that
are
unruly
comfort
the
feebleminded
support
the
weak
be
patient
toward
all
men
5
15
see
that
none
render
evil
for
evil
unto
any
man
but
ever
follow
that
which
is
good
both
among
yourselves
and
to
all
men
5
16
rejoice
evermore
5
17
pray
without
ceasing
5
18
in
every
thing
give
thanks
for
this
is
the
will
of
god
in
christ
jesus
concerning
you
5
19
quench
not
the
spirit
5
20
despise
not
prophesyings
5
21
prove
all
things
hold
fast
that
which
is
good
5
22
abstain
from
all
appearance
of
evil
5
23
and
the
very
god
of
peace
sanctify
you
wholly
and
i
pray
god
your
whole
spirit
and
soul
and
body
be
preserved
blameless
unto
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
5
24
faithful
is
he
that
calleth
you
who
also
will
do
it
5
25
brethren
pray
for
us
5
26
greet
all
the
brethren
with
an
holy
kiss
5
27
i
charge
you
by
the
lord
that
this
epistle
be
read
unto
all
the
holy
brethren
5
28
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
you
amen
the
second
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
thessalonians
1
1
paul
and
silvanus
and
timotheus
unto
the
church
of
the
thessalonians
in
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
1
2
grace
unto
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
1
3
we
are
bound
to
thank
god
always
for
you
brethren
as
it
is
meet
because
that
your
faith
groweth
exceedingly
and
the
charity
of
every
one
of
you
all
toward
each
other
aboundeth
1
4
so
that
we
ourselves
glory
in
you
in
the
churches
of
god
for
your
patience
and
faith
in
all
your
persecutions
and
tribulations
that
ye
endure
1
5
which
is
a
manifest
token
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
that
ye
may
be
counted
worthy
of
the
kingdom
of
god
for
which
ye
also
suffer
1
6
seeing
it
is
a
righteous
thing
with
god
to
recompense
tribulation
to
them
that
trouble
you
1
7
and
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
us
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
heaven
with
his
mighty
angels
1
8
in
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
god
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
1
9
who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
1
10
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
his
saints
and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
(because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed)
in
that
day
1
11
wherefore
also
we
pray
always
for
you
that
our
god
would
count
you
worthy
of
this
calling
and
fulfil
all
the
good
pleasure
of
his
goodness
and
the
work
of
faith
with
power
1
12
that
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
may
be
glorified
in
you
and
ye
in
him
according
to
the
grace
of
our
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
2
1
now
we
beseech
you
brethren
by
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
our
gathering
together
unto
him
2
2
that
ye
be
not
soon
shaken
in
mind
or
be
troubled
neither
by
spirit
nor
by
word
nor
by
letter
as
from
us
as
that
the
day
of
christ
is
at
hand
2
3
let
no
man
deceive
you
by
any
means
for
that
day
shall
not
come
except
there
come
a
falling
away
first
and
that
man
of
sin
be
revealed
the
son
of
perdition
2
4
who
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
worshipped
so
that
he
as
god
sitteth
in
the
temple
of
god
shewing
himself
that
he
is
god
2
5
remember
ye
not
that
when
i
was
yet
with
you
i
told
you
these
things
2
6
and
now
ye
know
what
withholdeth
that
he
might
be
revealed
in
his
time
2
7
for
the
mystery
of
iniquity
doth
already
work
only
he
who
now
letteth
will
let
until
he
be
taken
out
of
the
way
2
8
and
then
shall
that
wicked
be
revealed
whom
the
lord
shall
consume
with
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
and
shall
destroy
with
the
brightness
of
his
coming
2
9
even
him
whose
coming
is
after
the
working
of
satan
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
wonders
2
10
and
with
all
deceivableness
of
unrighteousness
in
them
that
perish
because
they
received
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
2
11
and
for
this
cause
god
shall
send
them
strong
delusion
that
they
should
believe
a
lie
2
12
that
they
all
might
be
damned
who
believed
not
the
truth
but
had
pleasure
in
unrighteousness
2
13
but
we
are
bound
to
give
thanks
alway
to
god
for
you
brethren
beloved
of
the
lord
because
god
hath
from
the
beginning
chosen
you
to
salvation
through
sanctification
of
the
spirit
and
belief
of
the
truth
2
14
whereunto
he
called
you
by
our
gospel
to
the
obtaining
of
the
glory
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
2
15
therefore
brethren
stand
fast
and
hold
the
traditions
which
ye
have
been
taught
whether
by
word
or
our
epistle
2
16
now
our
lord
jesus
christ
himself
and
god
even
our
father
which
hath
loved
us
and
hath
given
us
everlasting
consolation
and
good
hope
through
grace
2
17
comfort
your
hearts
and
stablish
you
in
every
good
word
and
work
3
1
finally
brethren
pray
for
us
that
the
word
of
the
lord
may
have
free
course
and
be
glorified
even
as
it
is
with
you
3
2
and
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
unreasonable
and
wicked
men
for
all
men
have
not
faith
3
3
but
the
lord
is
faithful
who
shall
stablish
you
and
keep
you
from
evil
3
4
and
we
have
confidence
in
the
lord
touching
you
that
ye
both
do
and
will
do
the
things
which
we
command
you
3
5
and
the
lord
direct
your
hearts
into
the
love
of
god
and
into
the
patient
waiting
for
christ
3
6
now
we
command
you
brethren
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
ye
withdraw
yourselves
from
every
brother
that
walketh
disorderly
and
not
after
the
tradition
which
he
received
of
us
3
7
for
yourselves
know
how
ye
ought
to
follow
us
for
we
behaved
not
ourselves
disorderly
among
you
3
8
neither
did
we
eat
any
man’s
bread
for
nought
but
wrought
with
labour
and
travail
night
and
day
that
we
might
not
be
chargeable
to
any
of
you

not
because
we
have
not
power
but
to
make
ourselves
an
ensample
unto
you
to
follow
us
3
10
for
even
when
we
were
with
you
this
we
commanded
you
that
if
any
would
not
work
neither
should
he
eat
3
11
for
we
hear
that
there
are
some
which
walk
among
you
disorderly
working
not
at
all
but
are
busybodies
3
12
now
them
that
are
such
we
command
and
exhort
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
with
quietness
they
work
and
eat
their
own
bread
3
13
but
ye
brethren
be
not
weary
in
well
doing
3
14
and
if
any
man
obey
not
our
word
by
this
epistle
note
that
man
and
have
no
company
with
him
that
he
may
be
ashamed
3
15
yet
count
him
not
as
an
enemy
but
admonish
him
as
a
brother
3
16
now
the
lord
of
peace
himself
give
you
peace
always
by
all
means
the
lord
be
with
you
all
3
17
the
salutation
of
paul
with
mine
own
hand
which
is
the
token
in
every
epistle
so
i
write
3
18
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
you
all
amen
the
first
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
timothy
1
1
paul
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
by
the
commandment
of
god
our
saviour
and
lord
jesus
christ
which
is
our
hope
1
2
unto
timothy
my
own
son
in
the
faith
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
jesus
christ
our
lord
1
3
as
i
besought
thee
to
abide
still
at
ephesus
when
i
went
into
macedonia
that
thou
mightest
charge
some
that
they
teach
no
other
doctrine
1
4
neither
give
heed
to
fables
and
endless
genealogies
which
minister
questions
rather
than
godly
edifying
which
is
in
faith
so
do
1
5
now
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
charity
out
of
a
pure
heart
and
of
a
good
conscience
and
of
faith
unfeigned
1
6
from
which
some
having
swerved
have
turned
aside
unto
vain
jangling
1
7
desiring
to
be
teachers
of
the
law
understanding
neither
what
they
say
nor
whereof
they
affirm
1
8
but
we
know
that
the
law
is
good
if
a
man
use
it
lawfully
1
9
knowing
this
that
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
man
but
for
the
lawless
and
disobedient
for
the
ungodly
and
for
sinners
for
unholy
and
profane
for
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
mothers
for
manslayers
1
10
for
whoremongers
for
them
that
defile
themselves
with
mankind
for
menstealers
for
liars
for
perjured
persons
and
if
there
be
any
other
thing
that
is
contrary
to
sound
doctrine
1
11
according
to
the
glorious
gospel
of
the
blessed
god
which
was
committed
to
my
trust
1
12
and
i
thank
christ
jesus
our
lord
who
hath
enabled
me
for
that
he
counted
me
faithful
putting
me
into
the
ministry
1
13
who
was
before
a
blasphemer
and
a
persecutor
and
injurious
but
i
obtained
mercy
because
i
did
it
ignorantly
in
unbelief
1
14
and
the
grace
of
our
lord
was
exceeding
abundant
with
faith
and
love
which
is
in
christ
jesus
1
15
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation
that
christ
jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
of
whom
i
am
chief
1
16
howbeit
for
this
cause
i
obtained
mercy
that
in
me
first
jesus
christ
might
shew
forth
all
longsuffering
for
a
pattern
to
them
which
should
hereafter
believe
on
him
to
life
everlasting
1
17
now
unto
the
king
eternal
immortal
invisible
the
only
wise
god
be
honour
and
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
1
18
this
charge
i
commit
unto
thee
son
timothy
according
to
the
prophecies
which
went
before
on
thee
that
thou
by
them
mightest
war
a
good
warfare
1
19
holding
faith
and
a
good
conscience
which
some
having
put
away
concerning
faith
have
made
shipwreck
1
20
of
whom
is
hymenaeus
and
alexander
whom
i
have
delivered
unto
satan
that
they
may
learn
not
to
blaspheme
2
1
i
exhort
therefore
that
first
of
all
supplications
prayers
intercessions
and
giving
of
thanks
be
made
for
all
men
2
2
for
kings
and
for
all
that
are
in
authority
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
honesty
2
3
for
this
is
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
saviour
2
4
who
will
have
all
men
to
be
saved
and
to
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
2
5
for
there
is
one
god
and
one
mediator
between
god
and
men
the
man
christ
jesus
2
6
who
gave
himself
a
ransom
for
all
to
be
testified
in
due
time
2
7
whereunto
i
am
ordained
a
preacher
and
an
apostle
(i
speak
the
truth
in
christ
and
lie
not
)
a
teacher
of
the
gentiles
in
faith
and
verity
2
8
i
will
therefore
that
men
pray
every
where
lifting
up
holy
hands
without
wrath
and
doubting
2
9
in
like
manner
also
that
women
adorn
themselves
in
modest
apparel
with
shamefacedness
and
sobriety
not
with
broided
hair
or
gold
or
pearls
or
costly
array
2
10
but
(which
becometh
women
professing
godliness)
with
good
works
2
11
let
the
woman
learn
in
silence
with
all
subjection
2
12
but
i
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man
but
to
be
in
silence
2
13
for
adam
was
first
formed
then
eve
2
14
and
adam
was
not
deceived
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression
2
15
notwithstanding
she
shall
be
saved
in
childbearing
if
they
continue
in
faith
and
charity
and
holiness
with
sobriety
3
1
this
is
a
true
saying
if
a
man
desire
the
office
of
a
bishop
he
desireth
a
good
work
3
2
a
bishop
then
must
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
vigilant
sober
of
good
behaviour
given
to
hospitality
apt
to
teach
3
3
not
given
to
wine
no
striker
not
greedy
of
filthy
lucre
but
patient
not
a
brawler
not
covetous
3
4
one
that
ruleth
well
his
own
house
having
his
children
in
subjection
with
all
gravity
3
5
(for
if
a
man
know
not
how
to
rule
his
own
house
how
shall
he
take
care
of
the
church
of
god
)
3
6
not
a
novice
lest
being
lifted
up
with
pride
he
fall
into
the
condemnation
of
the
devil
3
7
moreover
he
must
have
a
good
report
of
them
which
are
without
lest
he
fall
into
reproach
and
the
snare
of
the
devil
3
8
likewise
must
the
deacons
be
grave
not
doubletongued
not
given
to
much
wine
not
greedy
of
filthy
lucre
3
9
holding
the
mystery
of
the
faith
in
a
pure
conscience
3
10
and
let
these
also
first
be
proved
then
let
them
use
the
office
of
a
deacon
being
found
blameless
3
11
even
so
must
their
wives
be
grave
not
slanderers
sober
faithful
in
all
things
3
12
let
the
deacons
be
the
husbands
of
one
wife
ruling
their
children
and
their
own
houses
well
3
13
for
they
that
have
used
the
office
of
a
deacon
well
purchase
to
themselves
a
good
degree
and
great
boldness
in
the
faith
which
is
in
christ
jesus
3
14
these
things
write
i
unto
thee
hoping
to
come
unto
thee
shortly
3
15
but
if
i
tarry
long
that
thou
mayest
know
how
thou
oughtest
to
behave
thyself
in
the
house
of
god
which
is
the
church
of
the
living
god
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
3
16
and
without
controversy
great
is
the
mystery
of
godliness
god
was
manifest
in
the
flesh
justified
in
the
spirit
seen
of
angels
preached
unto
the
gentiles
believed
on
in
the
world
received
up
into
glory
4
1
now
the
spirit
speaketh
expressly
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
seducing
spirits
and
doctrines
of
devils
4
2
speaking
lies
in
hypocrisy
having
their
conscience
seared
with
a
hot
iron
4
3
forbidding
to
marry
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats
which
god
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thanksgiving
of
them
which
believe
and
know
the
truth
4
4
for
every
creature
of
god
is
good
and
nothing
to
be
refused
if
it
be
received
with
thanksgiving
4
5
for
it
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
god
and
prayer
4
6
if
thou
put
the
brethren
in
remembrance
of
these
things
thou
shalt
be
a
good
minister
of
jesus
christ
nourished
up
in
the
words
of
faith
and
of
good
doctrine
whereunto
thou
hast
attained
4
7
but
refuse
profane
and
old
wives’
fables
and
exercise
thyself
rather
unto
godliness
4
8
for
bodily
exercise
profiteth
little
but
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
things
having
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is
and
of
that
which
is
to
come
4
9
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation
4
10
for
therefore
we
both
labour
and
suffer
reproach
because
we
trust
in
the
living
god
who
is
the
saviour
of
all
men
specially
of
those
that
believe
4
11
these
things
command
and
teach
4
12
let
no
man
despise
thy
youth
but
be
thou
an
example
of
the
believers
in
word
in
conversation
in
charity
in
spirit
in
faith
in
purity
4
13
till
i
come
give
attendance
to
reading
to
exhortation
to
doctrine
4
14
neglect
not
the
gift
that
is
in
thee
which
was
given
thee
by
prophecy
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
presbytery
4
15
meditate
upon
these
things
give
thyself
wholly
to
them
that
thy
profiting
may
appear
to
all
4
16
take
heed
unto
thyself
and
unto
the
doctrine
continue
in
them
for
in
doing
this
thou
shalt
both
save
thyself
and
them
that
hear
thee
5
1
rebuke
not
an
elder
but
intreat
him
as
a
father
and
the
younger
men
as
brethren
5
2
the
elder
women
as
mothers
the
younger
as
sisters
with
all
purity
5
3
honour
widows
that
are
widows
indeed
5
4
but
if
any
widow
have
children
or
nephews
let
them
learn
first
to
shew
piety
at
home
and
to
requite
their
parents
for
that
is
good
and
acceptable
before
god
5
5
now
she
that
is
a
widow
indeed
and
desolate
trusteth
in
god
and
continueth
in
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
day
5
6
but
she
that
liveth
in
pleasure
is
dead
while
she
liveth
5
7
and
these
things
give
in
charge
that
they
may
be
blameless
5
8
but
if
any
provide
not
for
his
own
and
specially
for
those
of
his
own
house
he
hath
denied
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel
5
9
let
not
a
widow
be
taken
into
the
number
under
threescore
years
old
having
been
the
wife
of
one
man
5
10
well
reported
of
for
good
works
if
she
have
brought
up
children
if
she
have
lodged
strangers
if
she
have
washed
the
saints’
feet
if
she
have
relieved
the
afflicted
if
she
have
diligently
followed
every
good
work
5
11
but
the
younger
widows
refuse
for
when
they
have
begun
to
wax
wanton
against
christ
they
will
marry
5
12
having
damnation
because
they
have
cast
off
their
first
faith
5
13
and
withal
they
learn
to
be
idle
wandering
about
from
house
to
house
and
not
only
idle
but
tattlers
also
and
busybodies
speaking
things
which
they
ought
not
5
14
i
will
therefore
that
the
younger
women
marry
bear
children
guide
the
house
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully
5
15
for
some
are
already
turned
aside
after
satan
5
16
if
any
man
or
woman
that
believeth
have
widows
let
them
relieve
them
and
let
not
the
church
be
charged
that
it
may
relieve
them
that
are
widows
indeed
5
17
let
the
elders
that
rule
well
be
counted
worthy
of
double
honour
especially
they
who
labour
in
the
word
and
doctrine
5
18
for
the
scripture
saith
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
and
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
reward
5
19
against
an
elder
receive
not
an
accusation
but
before
two
or
three
witnesses
5
20
them
that
sin
rebuke
before
all
that
others
also
may
fear
5
21
i
charge
thee
before
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
elect
angels
that
thou
observe
these
things
without
preferring
one
before
another
doing
nothing
by
partiality
5
22
lay
hands
suddenly
on
no
man
neither
be
partaker
of
other
men’s
sins
keep
thyself
pure
5
23
drink
no
longer
water
but
use
a
little
wine
for
thy
stomach’s
sake
and
thine
often
infirmities
5
24
some
men’s
sins
are
open
beforehand
going
before
to
judgment
and
some
men
they
follow
after
5
25
likewise
also
the
good
works
of
some
are
manifest
beforehand
and
they
that
are
otherwise
cannot
be
hid
6
1
let
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honour
that
the
name
of
god
and
his
doctrine
be
not
blasphemed
6
2
and
they
that
have
believing
masters
let
them
not
despise
them
because
they
are
brethren
but
rather
do
them
service
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved
partakers
of
the
benefit
these
things
teach
and
exhort
6
3
if
any
man
teach
otherwise
and
consent
not
to
wholesome
words
even
the
words
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
to
the
doctrine
which
is
according
to
godliness
6
4
he
is
proud
knowing
nothing
but
doting
about
questions
and
strifes
of
words
whereof
cometh
envy
strife
railings
evil
surmisings
6
5
perverse
disputings
of
men
of
corrupt
minds
and
destitute
of
the
truth
supposing
that
gain
is
godliness
from
such
withdraw
thyself
6
6
but
godliness
with
contentment
is
great
gain
6
7
for
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world
and
it
is
certain
we
can
carry
nothing
out
6
8
and
having
food
and
raiment
let
us
be
therewith
content
6
9
but
they
that
will
be
rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a
snare
and
into
many
foolish
and
hurtful
lusts
which
drown
men
in
destruction
and
perdition
6
10
for
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
which
while
some
coveted
after
they
have
erred
from
the
faith
and
pierced
themselves
through
with
many
sorrows
6
11
but
thou
o
man
of
god
flee
these
things
and
follow
after
righteousness
godliness
faith
love
patience
meekness
6
12
fight
the
good
fight
of
faith
lay
hold
on
eternal
life
whereunto
thou
art
also
called
and
hast
professed
a
good
profession
before
many
witnesses
6
13
i
give
thee
charge
in
the
sight
of
god
who
quickeneth
all
things
and
before
christ
jesus
who
before
pontius
pilate
witnessed
a
good
confession
6
14
that
thou
keep
this
commandment
without
spot
unrebukable
until
the
appearing
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
6
15
which
in
his
times
he
shall
shew
who
is
the
blessed
and
only
potentate
the
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
6
16
who
only
hath
immortality
dwelling
in
the
light
which
no
man
can
approach
unto
whom
no
man
hath
seen
nor
can
see
to
whom
be
honour
and
power
everlasting
amen
6
17
charge
them
that
are
rich
in
this
world
that
they
be
not
highminded
nor

o

keep
that
which
is
committed
to
thy
trust
avoiding
profane
and
vain
babblings
and
oppositions
of
science
falsely
so
called

which
some
professing
have
erred
concerning
the
faith
grace
be
with
thee
amen
the
second
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
timothy

paul
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
by
the
will
of
god
according
to
the
promise
of
life
which
is
in
christ
jesus
1

to
timothy
my
dearly
beloved
son
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
christ
jesus
our
lord
1
3
i
thank
god
whom
i
serve
from
my
forefathers
with
pure
conscience
that
without
ceasing
i
have
remembrance
of
thee
in
my
prayers
night
and
day
1
4
greatly
desiring
to
see
thee
being
mindful
of
thy
tears
that
i
may
be
filled
with
joy
1
5
when
i
call
to
remembrance
the
unfeigned
faith
that
is
in
thee
which
dwelt
first
in
thy
grandmother
lois
and
thy
mother
eunice
and
i
am
persuaded
that
in
thee
also
1
6
wherefore
i
put
thee
in
remembrance
that
thou
stir
up
the
gift
of
god
which
is
in
thee
by
the
putting
on
of
my
hands
1
7
for
god
hath
not
given
us
the
spirit
of
fear
but
of
power
and
of
love
and
of
a
sound
mind
1
8
be
not
thou
therefore
ashamed
of
the
testimony
of
our
lord
nor
of
me
his
prisoner
but
be
thou
partaker
of
the
afflictions
of
the
gospel
according
to
the
power
of
god
1
9
who
hath
saved
us
and
called
us
with
an
holy
calling
not
according
to
our
works
but
according
to
his
own
purpose
and
grace
which
was
given
us
in
christ
jesus
before
the
world
began
1
10
but
is
now
made
manifest
by
the
appearing
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
who
hath
abolished
death
and
hath
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
gospel
1
11
whereunto
i
am
appointed
a
preacher
and
an
apostle
and
a
teacher
of
the
gentiles
1
12
for
the
which
cause
i
also
suffer
these
things
nevertheless
i
am
not
ashamed
for
i
know
whom
i
have
believed
and
am
persuaded
that
he
is
able
to
keep
that
which
i
have
committed
unto
him
against
that
day
1
13
hold
fast
the
form
of
sound
words
which
thou
hast
heard
of
me
in
faith
and
love
which
is
in
christ
jesus
1
14
that
good
thing
which
was
committed
unto
thee
keep
by
the
holy
ghost
which
dwelleth
in
us
1
15
this
thou
knowest
that
all
they
which
are
in
asia
be
turned
away
from
me
of
whom
are
phygellus
and
hermogenes
1
16
the
lord
give
mercy
unto
the
house
of
onesiphorus
for
he
oft
refreshed
me
and
was
not
ashamed
of
my
chain
1
17
but
when
he
was
in
rome
he
sought
me
out
very
diligently
and
found
me
1
18
the
lord
grant
unto
him
that
he
may
find
mercy
of
the
lord
in
that
day
and
in
how
many
things
he
ministered
unto
me
at
ephesus
thou
knowest
very
well
2
1
thou
therefore
my
son
be
strong
in
the
grace
that
is
in
christ
jesus
2
2
and
the
things
that
thou
hast
heard
of
me
among
many
witnesses
the
same
commit
thou
to
faithful
men
who
shall
be
able
to
teach
others
also
2
3
thou
therefore
endure
hardness
as
a
good
soldier
of
jesus
christ
2
4
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
that
he
may
please
him
who
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
soldier
2
5
and
if
a
man
also
strive
for
masteries
yet
is
he
not
crowned
except
he
strive
lawfully
2
6
the
husbandman
that
laboureth
must
be
first
partaker
of
the
fruits
2
7
consider
what
i
say
and
the
lord
give
thee
understanding
in
all
things
2
8
remember
that
jesus
christ
of
the
seed
of
david
was
raised
from
the
dead
according
to
my
gospel
2
9
wherein
i
suffer
trouble
as
an
evil
doer
even
unto
bonds
but
the
word
of
god
is
not
bound
2
10
therefore
i
endure
all
things
for
the
elect’s
sakes
that
they
may
also
obtain
the
salvation
which
is
in
christ
jesus
with
eternal
glory
2
11
it
is
a
faithful
saying
for
if
we
be
dead
with
him
we
shall
also
live
with
him
2
12
if
we
suffer
we
shall
also
reign
with
him
if
we
deny
him
he
also
will
deny
us
2
13
if
we
believe
not
yet
he
abideth
faithful
he
cannot
deny
himself
2
14
of
these
things
put
them
in
remembrance
charging
them
before
the
lord
that
they
strive
not
about
words
to
no
profit
but
to
the
subverting
of
the
hearers
2
15
study
to
shew
thyself
approved
unto
god
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
rightly
dividing
the
word
of
truth
2
16
but
shun
profane
and
vain
babblings
for
they
will
increase
unto
more
ungodliness
2
17
and
their
word
will
eat
as
doth
a
canker
of
whom
is
hymenaeus
and
philetus
2
18
who
concerning
the
truth
have
erred
saying
that
the
resurrection
is
past
already
and
overthrow
the
faith
of
some
2
19
nevertheless
the
foundation
of
god
standeth
sure
having
this
seal
the
lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his
and
let
every
one
that
nameth
the
name
of
christ
depart
from
iniquity
2
20
but
in
a
great
house
there
are
not
only
vessels
of
gold
and
of
silver
but
also
of
wood
and
of
earth
and
some
to
honour
and
some
to
dishonour
2
21
if
a
man
therefore
purge
himself
from
these
he
shall
be
a
vessel
unto
honour
sanctified
and
meet
for
the
master’s
use
and
prepared
unto
every
good
work
2
22
flee
also
youthful
lusts
but
follow
righteousness
faith
charity
peace
with
them
that
call
on
the
lord
out
of
a
pure
heart
2
23
but
foolish
and
unlearned
questions
avoid
knowing
that
they
do
gender
strifes
2
24
and
the
servant
of
the
lord
must
not
strive
but
be
gentle
unto
all
men
apt
to
teach
patient
2
25
in
meekness
instructing
those
that
oppose
themselves
if
god
peradventure
will
give
them
repentance
to
the
acknowledging
of
the
truth
2
26
and
that
they
may
recover
themselves
out
of
the
snare
of
the
devil
who
are
taken
captive
by
him
at
his
will
3
1
this
know
also
that
in
the
last
days
perilous
times
shall
come
3
2
for
men
shall
be
lovers
of
their
own
selves
covetous
boasters
proud
blasphemers
disobedient
to
parents
unthankful
unholy
3
3
without
natural
affection
trucebreakers
false
accusers
incontinent
fierce
despisers
of
those
that
are
good
3
4
traitors
heady
highminded
lovers
of
pleasures
more
than
lovers
of
god
3
5
having
a
form
of
godliness
but
denying
the
power
thereof
from
such
turn
away
3
6
for
of
this
sort
are
they
which
creep
into
houses
and
lead
captive
silly
women
laden
with
sins
led
away
with
divers
lusts
3
7
ever
learning
and
never
able
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
3
8
now
as
jannes
and
jambres
withstood
moses
so
do
these
also
resist
the
truth
men
of
corrupt
minds
reprobate
concerning
the
faith
3
9
but
they
shall
proceed
no
further
for
their
folly
shall
be
manifest
unto
all
men
as
theirs
also
was
3
10
but
thou
hast
fully
known
my
doctrine
manner
of
life
purpose
faith
longsuffering
charity
patience
3
11
persecutions
afflictions
which
came
unto
me
at
antioch
at
iconium
at
lystra
what
persecutions
i
endured
but
out
of
them
all
the
lord
delivered
me
3
12
yea
and
all
that
will
live
godly
in
christ
jesus
shall
suffer
persecution
3
13
but
evil
men
and
seducers
shall
wax
worse
and
worse
deceiving
and
being
deceived
3
14
but
continue
thou
in
the
things
which
thou
hast
learned
and
hast
been
assured
of
knowing
of
whom
thou
hast
learned
them
3
15
and
that
from
a
child
thou
hast
known
the
holy
scriptures
which
are
able
to
make
thee
wise
unto
salvation
through
faith
which
is
in
christ
jesus
3
16
all
scripture
is
given
by
inspiration
of
god
and
is
profitable
for
doctrine
for
reproof
for
correction
for
instruction
in
righteousness
3
17
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
perfect
throughly
furnished
unto
all
good
works
4
1
i
charge
thee
therefore
before
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
at
his
appearing
and
his
kingdom
4

preach
the
word
be
instant
in
season
out
of
season
reprove
rebuke
exhort
with
all
longsuffering
and
doctrine
4
3
for
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
but
after
their
own
lusts
shall
they
heap
to
themselves
teachers
having
itching
ears
4
4
and
they
shall
turn
away
their
ears
from
the
truth
and
shall
be
turned
unto
fables
4
5
but
watch
thou
in
all
things
endure
afflictions
do
the
work
of
an
evangelist
make
full
proof
of
thy
ministry
4

for
i
am
now
ready
to
be
offered

the
time
of
my
departure
is
at

i
have
fought
a
good
fight
i
have
finished
my
course
i
have
kept

henceforth
there
is
laid
up
for
me
a
crown
of
righteousness
which
the
lord
the
righteous
judge
shall
give
me
at
that
day
and
not
to
me

unto
all

strengthened
me
that

paul
a

according

and
the
acknowledging
of
the

which
is

in
hope
of
eternal

which
god
that
cannot

promised
before
the

but
hath
in
due
times
manifested
his
word
through
preaching
which
is
committed
unto
me
according
to
the
commandment
of
god
our
saviour
1

to
titus
mine
own
son
after
the
common
faith
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
our
saviour
1
5
for
this
cause
left
i
thee
in
crete
that
thou
shouldest
set
in
order
the
things
that
are
wanting
and
ordain
elders
in
every
city
as
i
had
appointed
thee
1

if
any
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
having
faithful
children
not
accused
of
riot
or
unruly
1
7
for
a
bishop
must
be
blameless
as
the
steward
of
god
not
selfwilled
not
soon
angry
not
given
to
wine
no
striker
not
given
to
filthy
lucre
1
8
but
a
lover
of
hospitality
a
lover
of
good
men
sober
just
holy
temperate
1
9
holding
fast
the
faithful
word
as
he
hath
been
taught
that
he
may
be
able
by
sound
doctrine
both
to
exhort
and
to
convince
the
gainsayers
1
10
for
there
are
many
unruly
and
vain
talkers
and
deceivers
specially
they
of
the
circumcision
1
11
whose
mouths
must
be
stopped
who
subvert
whole
houses
teaching
things
which
they
ought
not
for
filthy
lucre’s
sake
1
12
one
of
themselves
even
a
prophet
of
their
own
said
the
cretians
are
alway
liars
evil
beasts
slow
bellies
1
13
this
witness
is
true
wherefore
rebuke
them
sharply
that
they
may
be
sound
in
the
faith
1
14
not
giving
heed
to
jewish
fables
and
commandments
of
men
that
turn
from
the
truth
1
15
unto
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
but
unto
them
that
are
defiled
and
unbelieving
is
nothing
pure
but
even
their
mind
and
conscience
is
defiled
1
16
they
profess
that
they
know
god
but
in
works
they
deny
him
being
abominable
and
disobedient
and
unto
every
good
work
reprobate
2
1
but
speak
thou
the
things
which
become
sound
doctrine
2
2
that
the
aged
men
be
sober
grave
temperate
sound
in
faith
in
charity
in
patience
2
3
the
aged
women
likewise
that
they
be
in
behaviour
as
becometh
holiness
not
false
accusers
not
given
to
much
wine
teachers
of
good
things
2
4
that
they
may
teach
the
young
women
to
be
sober
to
love
their
husbands
to
love
their
children
2
5
to
be
discreet
chaste
keepers
at
home
good
obedient
to
their
own
husbands
that
the
word
of
god
be
not
blasphemed
2
6
young
men
likewise
exhort
to
be
sober
minded
2
7
in
all
things
shewing
thyself
a
pattern
of
good
works
in
doctrine
shewing
uncorruptness
gravity
sincerity
2
8
sound
speech
that
cannot
be
condemned
that
he
that
is
of
the
contrary
part
may
be
ashamed
having
no
evil
thing
to
say
of
you
2
9
exhort
servants
to
be
obedient
unto
their
own
masters
and
to
please
them
well
in
all
things
not
answering
again
2
10
not
purloining
but
shewing
all
good
fidelity
that
they
may
adorn
the
doctrine
of
god
our
saviour
in
all
things
2
11
for
the
grace
of
god
that
bringeth
salvation
hath
appeared
to
all
men
2
12
teaching
us
that
denying
ungodliness
and
worldly
lusts
we
should
live
soberly
righteously
and
godly
in
this
present
world
2
13
looking
for
that
blessed
hope
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
god

saviour
jesus
christ
2
14
who
gave
himself
for
us
that
he
might
redeem
us
from
all
iniquity
and
purify
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people
zealous
of
good
works
2
15
these
things
speak
and
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
authority
let
no
man
despise
thee
3
1
put
them
in
mind
to
be
subject
to
principalities
and
powers
to
obey
magistrates
to
be
ready
to
every
good
work
3
2
to
speak
evil
of
no
man
to
be
no
brawlers
but
gentle
shewing
all
meekness
unto
all
men
3
3
for
we
ourselves
also
were
sometimes
foolish
disobedient
deceived
serving
divers
lusts
and
pleasures
living
in
malice
and
envy
hateful
and
hating
one
another
3
4
but
after
that
the
kindness
and
love
of
god
our
saviour
toward
man
appeared
3
5
not
by
works
of
righteousness
which
we
have
done
but
according
to
his
mercy
he
saved
us
by
the
washing
of
regeneration
and
renewing
of
the
holy
ghost
3
6
which
he
shed
on
us
abundantly
through
jesus
christ
our
saviour
3
7
that
being
justified
by
his
grace
we
should
be
made
heirs
according
to
the
hope
of
eternal
life
3
8
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
these
things
i
will
that
thou
affirm
constantly
that
they
which
have
believed
in
god
might
be
careful
to
maintain
good
works
these
things
are
good
and
profitable
unto
men
3
9
but
avoid
foolish
questions
and
genealogies
and
contentions
and
strivings
about
the
law
for
they
are
unprofitable
and
vain
3
10
a
man
that
is
an
heretick
after
the
first
and
second
admonition
reject
3
11
knowing
that
he
that
is
such
is
subverted
and
sinneth
being
condemned
of
himself
3
12
when
i
shall
send
artemas
unto
thee
or
tychicus
be
diligent
to
come
unto
me
to
nicopolis
for
i
have
determined
there
to
winter
3
13
bring
zenas
the
lawyer
and
apollos
on
their
journey
diligently
that
nothing
be
wanting
unto
them
3
14
and
let
ours
also
learn
to
maintain
good
works
for
necessary
uses
that
they
be
not
unfruitful
3
15
all
that
are
with
me
salute
thee
greet
them
that
love
us
in
the
faith
grace
be
with
you
all
amen
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
philemon

paul
a
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
and
timothy
our
brother
unto
philemon
our
dearly
beloved
and
fellowlabourer
1

and
to
our
beloved
apphia
and
archippus
our
fellowsoldier
and
to
the
church
in
thy
house
1
3
grace
to
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
1
4
i
thank
my
god
making
mention
of
thee
always
in
my
prayers
1
5
hearing
of
thy
love
and
faith
which
thou
hast
toward
the
lord
jesus
and
toward
all
saints
1
6
that
the
communication
of
thy
faith
may
become
effectual
by
the
acknowledging
of
every
good
thing
which
is
in
you
in
christ
jesus
1
7
for
we
have
great
joy
and
consolation
in
thy
love
because
the
bowels
of
the
saints
are
refreshed
by
thee
brother
1
8
wherefore
though
i
might
be
much
bold
in
christ
to
enjoin
thee
that
which
is
convenient
1
9
yet
for
love’s
sake
i
rather
beseech
thee
being
such
an
one
as
paul
the
aged
and
now
also
a
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
1
10
i
beseech
thee
for
my
son
onesimus
whom
i
have
begotten
in
my
bonds
1
11
which
in
time
past
was
to
thee
unprofitable
but
now
profitable
to
thee
and
to
me
1
12
whom
i
have
sent
again
thou
therefore
receive
him
that
is
mine
own
bowels
1
13
whom
i
would
have
retained
with
me
that
in
thy
stead
he
might
have
ministered
unto
me
in
the
bonds
of
the
gospel
1
14
but
without
thy
mind
would
i
do
nothing
that
thy
benefit
should
not
be
as
it
were
of
necessity
but
willingly
1
15
for
perhaps
he
therefore
departed
for
a
season
that
thou
shouldest
receive
him
for
ever
1
16
not
now
as
a
servant
but
above
a
servant
a
brother
beloved
specially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
thee
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
lord
1
17
if
thou
count
me
therefore
a
partner
receive
him
as
myself
1
18
if
he
hath
wronged
thee
or
oweth
thee
ought
put
that
on
mine
account
1
19
i
paul
have
written
it
with
mine
own
hand
i
will
repay
it
albeit
i
do
not
say
to
thee
how
thou
owest
unto
me
even
thine
own
self
besides
1
20
yea
brother
let
me
have
joy
of
thee
in
the
lord
refresh
my
bowels
in
the
lord
1
21
having
confidence
in
thy
obedience
i
wrote
unto
thee
knowing
that
thou
wilt
also
do
more
than
i
say
1
22
but
withal
prepare
me
also
a
lodging
for
i
trust
that
through
your
prayers
i
shall
be
given
unto
you
1
23

the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
your
spirit
amen
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
hebrews
1
1
god
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets
1
2
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
son
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
things
by
whom
also
he
made
the
worlds
1
3
who
being
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
the
express
image
of
his
person
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sins
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
high
1
4
being
made
so
much
better
than
the
angels
as
he
hath
by
inheritance
obtained
a
more
excellent
name
than
they
1
5
for
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
and
again
i
will
be
to
him
a
father
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
son
1
6
and
again
when
he
bringeth
in
the
firstbegotten
into
the
world
he
saith
and
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
him
1
7
and
of
the
angels
he
saith
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
fire
1
8
but
unto
the
son
he
saith
thy
throne
o
god
is
for
ever
and
ever
a
sceptre
of
righteousness
is
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
1
9
thou
hast
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
therefore
god
even
thy
god
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows
1
10
and
thou
lord
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
hands
1
11
they
shall
perish
but
thou
remainest
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
garment
1
12
and
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
up
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
not
fail
1
13
but
to
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time
sit
on
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
1
14
are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
to
minister
for
them
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
2
1
therefore
we
ought
to
give
the
more
earnest
heed
to
the
things
which
we
have
heard
lest
at
any
time
we
should
let
them
slip
2
2
for
if
the
word
spoken
by
angels
was
stedfast
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a
just
recompence
of
reward
2
3
how
shall
we
escape
if
we
neglect
so
great
salvation
which
at
the
first
began
to
be
spoken
by
the
lord
and
was
confirmed
unto
us
by
them
that
heard
him
2
4
god
also
bearing
them
witness
both
with
signs
and
wonders
and
with
divers
miracles
and
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
according
to
his
own
will
2
5
for
unto
the
angels
hath
he
not
put
in
subjection
the
world
to
come
whereof
we
speak
2
6
but
one
in
a
certain
place
testified
saying
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
or
the
son
of
man
that
thou
visitest
him
2
7
thou
madest
him
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
honour
and
didst
set
him
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
2
8
thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
feet
for
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
him
he
left
nothing
that
is
not
put
under
him
but
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
him
2
9
but
we
see
jesus
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
death
crowned
with
glory
and
honour
that
he
by
the
grace
of
god
should
taste
death
for
every
man
2
10
for
it
became
him
for
whom
are
all
things
and
by
whom
are
all
things
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
glory
to
make
the
captain
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings
2
11
for
both
he
that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
are
all
of
one
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
brethren
2
12
saying
i
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
brethren
in
the
midst
of
the
church
will
i
sing
praise
unto
thee
2
13
and
again
i
will
put
my
trust
in
him
and
again
behold
i
and
the
children
which
god
hath
given
me
2
14
forasmuch
then
as
the
children
are
partakers
of
flesh
and
blood
he
also
himself
likewise
took
part
of
the
same
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
that
is
the
devil
2
15
and
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
bondage
2
16
for
verily
he
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angels
but
he
took
on
him
the
seed
of
abraham
2
17
wherefore
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
his
brethren
that
he
might
be
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
in
things
pertaining
to
god
to
make
reconciliation
for
the
sins
of
the
people
2
18
for
in
that
he
himself
hath
suffered
being
tempted
he
is
able
to
succour
them
that
are
tempted
3
1
wherefore
holy
brethren
partakers
of
the
heavenly
calling
consider
the
apostle
and
high
priest
of
our
profession
christ
jesus
3
2
who
was
faithful
to
him
that
appointed
him
as
also
moses
was
faithful
in
all
his
house
3
3
for
this
man
was
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
moses
inasmuch
as
he
who
hath
builded
the
house
hath
more
honour
than
the
house
3
4
for
every
house
is
builded
by
some
man
but
he
that
built
all
things
is
god
3
5
and
moses
verily
was
faithful
in
all
his
house
as
a
servant
for
a
testimony
of
those
things
which
were
to
be
spoken
after
3
6
but
christ
as
a
son
over
his
own
house
whose
house
are
we
if
we
hold
fast
the
confidence
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
hope
firm
unto
the
end
3
7
wherefore
(as
the
holy
ghost
saith
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
3
8
harden
not
your
hearts
as
in
the
provocation
in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
wilderness
3
9
when
your
fathers
tempted
me
proved
me
and
saw
my
works
forty
years
3
10
wherefore
i
was
grieved
with
that
generation
and
said
they
do
alway
err
in
their
heart
and
they
have
not
known
my
ways
3
11
so
i
sware
in
my
wrath
they
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest
)
3
12
take
heed
brethren
lest
there
be
in
any
of
you
an
evil
heart
of
unbelief
in
departing
from
the
living
god
3
13
but
exhort
one
another
daily
while
it
is
called
to
day
lest
any
of
you
be
hardened
through
the
deceitfulness
of
sin
3
14
for
we
are
made
partakers
of
christ
if
we
hold
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
stedfast
unto
the
end
3
15
while
it
is
said
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
as
in
the
provocation
3
16
for
some
when
they
had
heard
did
provoke
howbeit
not
all
that
came
out
of
egypt
by
moses
3
17
but
with
whom
was
he
grieved
forty
years
was
it
not
with
them
that
had
sinned
whose
carcases
fell
in
the
wilderness
3
18
and
to
whom
sware
he
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest
but
to
them
that
believed
not
3
19
so
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
unbelief
4
1
let
us
therefore
fear
lest
a
promise
being
left
us
of
entering
into
his
rest
any
of
you
should
seem
to
come
short
of
it
4
2
for
unto
us
was
the
gospel
preached
as
well
as
unto
them
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
them
not
being
mixed
with
faith
in
them
that
heard
it
4
3
for
we
which
have
believed
do
enter
into
rest
as
he
said
as
i
have
sworn
in
my
wrath
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest
although
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
4
4
for
he
spake
in
a
certain
place
of
the
seventh
day
on
this
wise
and
god
did
rest
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
works
4
5
and
in
this
place
again
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest
4
6
seeing
therefore
it
remaineth
that
some
must
enter
therein
and
they
to
whom
it
was
first
preached
entered
not
in
because
of
unbelief
4
7
again
he
limiteth
a
certain
day
saying
in
david
to
day
after
so
long
a
time
as
it
is
said
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
4
8
for
if
jesus
had
given
them
rest
then
would
he
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
day
4
9
there
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
god
4
10
for
he
that
is
entered
into
his
rest
he
also
hath
ceased
from
his
own
works
as
god
did
from
his
4
11
let
us
labour
therefore
to
enter
into
that
rest
lest
any
man
fall
after
the
same
example
of
unbelief
4
12
for
the
word
of
god
is
quick
and
powerful
and
sharper
than
any
twoedged
sword
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
soul
and
spirit
and
of
the
joints
and
marrow
and
is
a
discerner
of
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
4
13
neither
is
there
any
creature
that
is
not
manifest
in
his
sight
but
all
things
are
naked
and
opened
unto
the
eyes
of
him
with
whom
we
have
to
do
4
14
seeing
then
that
we
have
a
great
high
priest
that
is
passed
into
the
heavens
jesus
the
son
of
god
let
us
hold
fast
our
profession
4
15
for
we
have
not
an
high
priest
which
cannot
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
we
are
yet
without
sin
4
16
let
us
therefore
come
boldly
unto
the
throne
of
grace
that
we
may
obtain
mercy
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
need
5
1
for
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
god
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins
5

who
can
have
compassion
on
the
ignorant
and
on
them
that
are
out
of
the
way
for
that
he
himself
also
is
compassed
with
infirmity
5
3
and
by
reason
hereof
he
ought
as
for
the
people
so
also
for
himself
to
offer
for
sins
5
4
and
no
man
taketh
this
honour
unto
himself
but
he
that
is
called
of
god
as
was
aaron
5
5
so
also
christ
glorified
not
himself
to
be
made
an
high
priest
but
he
that
said
unto
him
thou
art
my
son
to
day
have
i
begotten
thee
5
6
as
he
saith
also
in
another
place
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
5
7
who
in
the
days
of
his
flesh
when
he
had
offered
up
prayers
and
supplications
with
strong
crying
and
tears
unto
him
that
was
able
to
save
him
from
death
and
was
heard
in
that
he
feared
5
8
though
he
were
a
son
yet
learned
he
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
suffered
5
9
and
being
made
perfect
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
him
5
10
called
of
god
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
5
11
of
whom
we
have
many
things
to
say
and
hard
to
be
uttered
seeing
ye
are
dull
of
hearing
5
12
for
when
for
the
time
ye
ought
to
be
teachers
ye
have
need
that
one
teach
you
again
which
be
the
first
principles
of
the
oracles
of
god
and
are
become
such
as
have
need
of
milk
and
not
of
strong
meat
5
13
for
every
one
that
useth
milk
is
unskilful
in
the
word
of
righteousness
for
he
is
a
babe
5
14
but
strong
meat
belongeth
to
them
that
are
of
full
age
even
those
who
by
reason
of
use
have
their
senses
exercised
to
discern
both
good
and
evil
6
1
therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
let
us
go
on
unto
perfection
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
works
and
of
faith
toward
god
6
2
of
the
doctrine
of
baptisms
and
of
laying
on
of
hands
and
of
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
of
eternal
judgment
6
3
and
this
will
we
do
if
god
permit
6
4
for
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
were
once
enlightened
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
gift
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
holy
ghost
6
5
and
have
tasted
the
good
word
of
god
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
6
6
if
they
shall
fall
away
to
renew
them
again
unto
repentance
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
afresh
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame
6
7
for
the
earth
which
drinketh
in
the
rain
that
cometh
oft
upon
it
and
bringeth
forth
herbs
meet
for
them
by
whom
it
is
dressed
receiveth
blessing
from
god
6
8
but
that
which
beareth
thorns
and
briers
is
rejected
and
is
nigh
unto
cursing
whose
end
is
to
be
burned
6
9
but
beloved
we
are
persuaded
better
things
of
you
and
things
that
accompany
salvation
though
we
thus
speak
6
10
for
god
is
not
unrighteous
to
forget
your
work
and
labour
of
love
which
ye
have
shewed
toward
his
name
in
that
ye
have
ministered
to
the
saints
and
do
minister
6
11
and
we
desire
that
every
one
of
you
do
shew
the
same
diligence
to
the
full
assurance
of
hope
unto
the
end
6
12
that
ye
be
not
slothful
but
followers
of
them
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
promises
6
13
for
when
god
made
promise
to
abraham
because
he
could
swear
by
no
greater
he
sware
by
himself
6
14
saying
surely
blessing
i
will
bless
thee
and
multiplying
i
will
multiply
thee
6
15
and
so
after
he
had
patiently
endured
he
obtained
the
promise
6
16
for
men
verily
swear
by
the
greater
and
an
oath
for
confirmation
is
to
them
an
end
of
all
strife
6
17
wherein
god
willing
more
abundantly
to
shew
unto
the
heirs
of
promise
the
immutability
of
his
counsel
confirmed
it
by
an
oath
6
18
that
by
two
immutable
things
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
god
to
lie
we
might
have
a
strong
consolation
who
have
fled
for
refuge
to
lay
hold
upon
the
hope
set
before
us
6
19
which
hope
we
have
as
an
anchor
of
the
soul
both
sure
and
stedfast
and
which
entereth
into
that
within
the
veil
6
20
whither
the
forerunner
is
for
us
entered
even
jesus
made
an
high
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
7
1
for
this
melchisedec
king
of
salem
priest
of
the
most
high
god
who
met
abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
kings
and
blessed
him
7
2
to
whom
also
abraham
gave
a
tenth
part
of
all
first
being
by
interpretation
king
of
righteousness
and
after
that
also
king
of
salem
which
is
king
of
peace
7
3
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
life
but
made
like
unto
the
son
of
god
abideth
a
priest
continually
7
4
now
consider
how
great
this
man
was
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
abraham
gave
the
tenth
of
the
spoils
7
5
and
verily
they
that
are
of
the
sons
of
levi
who
receive
the
office
of
the
priesthood
have
a
commandment
to
take
tithes
of
the
people
according
to
the
law
that
is
of
their
brethren
though
they
come
out
of
the
loins
of
abraham
7
6
but
he
whose
descent
is
not
counted
from
them
received
tithes
of
abraham
and
blessed
him
that
had
the
promises
7
7
and
without
all
contradiction
the
less
is
blessed
of
the
better
7
8
and
here
men
that
die
receive
tithes
but
there
he
receiveth
them
of
whom
it
is
witnessed
that
he
liveth
7
9
and
as
i
may
so
say
levi
also
who
receiveth
tithes
payed
tithes
in
abraham
7
10
for
he
was
yet
in
the
loins
of
his
father
when
melchisedec
met
him
7
11
if
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
levitical
priesthood
(for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law
)
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
aaron
7
12
for
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
law
7
13
for
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
tribe
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
altar
7
14
for
it
is
evident
that
our
lord
sprang
out
of
juda
of
which
tribe
moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
7
15
and
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
priest
7
16
who
is
made
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
life
7
17
for
he
testifieth
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
7
18
for
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
thereof
7
19
for
the
law
made
nothing
perfect
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
did
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
god
7
20
and
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
priest
7
21
(for
those
priests
were
made
without
an
oath
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
him
the
lord
sware
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
)
7
22
by
so
much
was
jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
testament
7
23
and
they
truly
were
many
priests
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
death
7
24
but
this
man
because
he
continueth
ever
hath
an
unchangeable
priesthood
7
25
wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
god
by
him
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
them
7
26
for
such
an
high
priest
became
us
who
is
holy
harmless
undefiled
separate
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
7
27
who
needeth
not
daily
as
those
high
priests
to
offer
up
sacrifice
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
the
people’s
for
this
he
did
once
when
he
offered
up
himself
7
28
for
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity
but
the
word
of
the
oath
which
was
since
the
law
maketh
the
son
who
is
consecrated
for
evermore
8
1
now
of
the
things
which
we
have
spoken
this
is
the
sum
we
have
such
an
high
priest
who
is
set
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
the
majesty
in
the
heavens
8
2
a
minister
of
the
sanctuary
and
of
the
true
tabernacle
which
the
lord
pitched
and
not
man
8
3
for
every
high
priest
is
ordained
to
offer
gifts
and
sacrifices
wherefore
it
is
of
necessity
that
this
man
have
somewhat
also
to
offer
8
4
for
if
he
were
on
earth
he
should
not
be
a
priest
seeing
that
there
are
priests
that
offer
gifts
according
to
the
law
8
5
who
serve
unto
the
example
and
shadow
of
heavenly
things
as
moses
was
admonished
of
god
when
he
was
about
to
make
the
tabernacle
for
see
saith
he
that
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewed
to
thee
in
the
mount
8
6
but
now
hath
he
obtained
a
more
excellent
ministry
by
how
much
also
he
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
covenant
which
was
established
upon
better
promises
8
7
for
if
that
first
covenant
had
been
faultless
then
should
no
place
have
been
sought
for
the
second
8
8
for
finding
fault
with
them
he
saith
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
when
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
8
9
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
when
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
because
they
continued
not
in
my
covenant
and
i
regarded
them
not
saith
the
lord
8
10
for
this
is
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
laws
into
their
mind
and
write
them
in
their
hearts
and
i
will
be
to
them
a
god
and
they
shall
be
to
me
a
people
8
11
and
they
shall
not
teach
every
man
his
neighbour
and
every
man
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
for
all
shall
know
me
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
8
12
for
i
will
be
merciful
to
their
unrighteousness
and
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
i
remember
no
more
8
13
in
that
he
saith
a
new
covenant
he
hath
made
the
first
old
now
that
which
decayeth
and
waxeth
old
is
ready
to
vanish
away
9
1
then
verily
the
first
covenant
had
also
ordinances
of
divine
service
and
a
worldly
sanctuary
9
2
for
there
was
a
tabernacle
made
the
first
wherein
was
the
candlestick
and
the
table
and
the
shewbread
which
is
called
the
sanctuary
9
3
and
after
the
second
veil
the
tabernacle
which
is
called
the
holiest
of
all
9
4
which
had
the
golden
censer
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
overlaid
round
about
with
gold
wherein
was
the
golden
pot
that
had
manna
and
aaron’s
rod
that
budded
and
the
tables
of
the
covenant
9
5
and
over
it
the
cherubims
of
glory
shadowing
the
mercyseat
of
which
we
cannot
now
speak
particularly
9
6
now
when
these
things
were
thus
ordained
the
priests
went
always
into
the
first
tabernacle
accomplishing
the
service
of
god
9
7
but
into
the
second
went
the
high
priest
alone
once
every
year
not
without
blood
which
he
offered
for
himself
and
for
the
errors
of
the
people
9
8
the
holy
ghost
this
signifying
that
the
way
into
the
holiest
of
all
was
not
yet
made
manifest
while
as
the
first
tabernacle
was
yet
standing
9
9
which
was
a
figure
for
the
time
then
present
in
which
were
offered
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
that
could
not
make
him
that
did
the
service
perfect
as
pertaining
to
the
conscience
9
10
which
stood
only
in
meats
and
drinks
and
divers
washings
and
carnal
ordinances
imposed
on
them
until
the
time
of
reformation
9
11
but
christ
being
come
an
high
priest
of
good
things
to
come
by
a
greater
and
more
perfect
tabernacle
not
made
with
hands
that
is
to
say
not
of
this
building
9
12
neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
calves
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
place
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
for
us
9
13
for
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
unclean
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
flesh
9
14
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
christ
who
through
the
eternal
spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
god
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
god
9
15
and
for
this
cause
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
testament
that
by
means
of
death
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
testament
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
inheritance
9
16
for
where
a
testament
is
there
must
also
of
necessity
be
the
death
of
the
testator
9
17
for
a
testament
is
of
force
after
men
are
dead
otherwise
it
is
of
no
strength
at
all
while
the
testator
liveth
9
18
whereupon
neither
the
first
testament
was
dedicated
without
blood
9
19
for
when
moses
had
spoken
every
precept
to
all
the
people
according
to
the
law
he
took
the
blood
of
calves
and
of
goats
with
water
and
scarlet
wool
and
hyssop
and
sprinkled
both
the
book
and
all
the
people
9
20
saying
this
is
the
blood
of
the
testament
which
god
hath
enjoined
unto
you
9
21
moreover
he
sprinkled
with
blood
both
the
tabernacle
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
ministry
9
22
and
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
blood
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission
9
23
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
the
patterns
of
things
in
the
heavens
should
be
purified
with
these
but
the
heavenly
things
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
these
9
24
for
christ
is
not
entered
into
the
holy
places
made
with
hands
which
are
the
figures
of
the
true
but
into
heaven
itself
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
god
for
us
9
25
nor
yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
often
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
every
year
with
blood
of
others
9
26
for
then
must
he
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
now
once
in
the
end
of
the
world
hath
he
appeared
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
9
27
and
as
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to
die
but
after
this
the
judgment
9
28
so
christ
was
once
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
many
and
unto
them
that
look
for
him
shall
he
appear
the
second
time
without
sin
unto
salvation
10
1
for
the
law
having
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
come
and
not
the
very
image
of
the
things
can
never
with
those
sacrifices
which
they
offered
year
by
year
continually
make
the
comers
thereunto
perfect
10
2
for
then
would
they
not
have
ceased
to
be
offered
because
that
the
worshippers
once
purged
should
have
had
no
more
conscience
of
sins
10
3
but
in
those
sacrifices
there
is
a
remembrance
again
made
of
sins
every
year
10
4
for
it
is
not
possible
that
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
should
take
away
sins
10
5
wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
world
he
saith
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
not
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me
10
6
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hast
had
no
pleasure
10
7
then
said
i
lo
i
come
(in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
)
to
do
thy
will
o
god
10
8
above
when
he
said
sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt
offerings
and
offering
for
sin
thou
wouldest
not
neither
hadst
pleasure
therein
which
are
offered
by
the
law
10
9
then
said
he
lo
i
come
to
do
thy
will
o
god
he
taketh
away
the
first
that
he
may
establish
the
second
10
10
by
the
which
will
we
are
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ
once
for
all
10
11
and
every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
sacrifices
which
can
never
take
away
sins
10
12
but
this
man
after
he
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
ever
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
god
10
13
from
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
be
made
his
footstool
10
14
for
by
one
offering
he
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
sanctified
10
15
whereof
the
holy
ghost
also
is
a
witness
to
us
for
after
that
he
had
said
before
10
16
this
is
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
them
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
laws
into
their
hearts
and
in
their
minds
will
i
write
them
10
17
and
their
sins
and
iniquities
will
i
remember
no
more
10
18
now
where
remission
of
these
is
there
is
no
more
offering
for
sin
10
19
having
therefore
brethren
boldness
to
enter
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
jesus
10
20
by
a
new
and
living
way
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
through
the
veil
that
is
to
say
his
flesh
10
21
and
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
god
10
22
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
10
23
let
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
our
faith
without
wavering
(for
he
is
faithful
that
promised
)
10
24
and
let
us
consider
one
another
to
provoke
unto
love
and
to
good
works
10
25
not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
together
as
the
manner
of
some
is
but
exhorting
one
another
and
so
much
the
more
as
ye
see
the
day
approaching
10
26
for
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
sins
10
27
but
a
certain
fearful
looking
for
of
judgment
and
fiery
indignation
which
shall
devour
the
adversaries
10
28
he
that
despised
moses’
law
died
without
mercy
under
two
or
three
witnesses
10
29
of
how
much
sorer
punishment
suppose
ye
shall
he
be
thought
worthy
who
hath
trodden
under
foot
the
son
of
god
and
hath
counted
the
blood
of
the
covenant
wherewith
he
was
sanctified
an
unholy
thing
and
hath
done
despite
unto
the
spirit
of
grace
10
30
for
we
know
him
that
hath
said
vengeance
belongeth
unto
me
i
will
recompense
saith
the
lord
and
again
the
lord
shall
judge
his
people
10
31
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
10
32
but
call
to
remembrance
the
former
days
in
which
after
ye
were
illuminated
ye
endured
a
great
fight
of
afflictions
10
33
partly
whilst
ye
were
made
a
gazingstock
both
by
reproaches
and
afflictions
and
partly
whilst
ye
became
companions
of
them
that
were
so
used
10
34
for
ye
had
compassion
of
me
in
my
bonds
and
took
joyfully
the
spoiling
of
your
goods
knowing
in
yourselves
that
ye
have
in
heaven
a
better
and
an
enduring
substance
10
35
cast
not
away
therefore
your
confidence
which
hath
great
recompence
of
reward
10
36
for
ye
have
need
of
patience
that
after
ye
have
done
the
will
of
god
ye
might
receive
the
promise
10
37
for
yet
a
little
while
and
he
that
shall
come
will
come
and
will
not
tarry
10
38
now
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
but
if
any
man
draw
back
my
soul
shall
have
no
pleasure
in
him
10
39
but
we
are
not
of
them
who
draw
back
unto
perdition
but
of
them
that
believe
to
the
saving
of
the
soul
11
1
now
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
11
2
for
by
it
the
elders
obtained
a
good
report
11
3
through
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
god
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
do
appear
11
4
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
cain
by
which
he
obtained
witness
that
he
was
righteous
god
testifying
of
his
gifts
and
by
it
he
being
dead
yet
speaketh
11
5
by
faith
enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
death
and
was
not
found
because
god
had
translated
him
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
testimony
that
he
pleased
god
11
6
but
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
him
for
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
him
11
7
by
faith
noah
being
warned
of
god
of
things
not
seen
as
yet
moved
with
fear
prepared
an
ark
to
the
saving
of
his
house
by
the
which
he
condemned
the
world
and
became
heir
of
the
righteousness
which
is
by
faith
11
8
by
faith
abraham
when
he
was
called
to
go
out
into
a
place
which
he
should
after
receive
for
an
inheritance
obeyed
and
he
went
out
not
knowing
whither
he
went
11
9
by
faith
he
sojourned
in
the
land
of
promise
as
in
a
strange
country
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
isaac
and
jacob
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise
11
10
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
11
11
through
faith
also
sara
herself
received
strength
to
conceive
seed
and
was
delivered
of
a
child
when
she
was
past
age
because
she
judged
him
faithful
who
had
promised
11
12
therefore
sprang
there
even
of
one
and
him
as
good
as
dead
so
many
as
the
stars
of
the
sky
in
multitude
and
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
shore
innumerable
11
13
these
all
died
in
faith
not
having
received
the
promises
but
having
seen
them
afar
off
and
were
persuaded
of
them
and
embraced
them
and
confessed
that
they
were
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth
11
14
for
they
that
say
such
things
declare
plainly
that
they
seek
a
country
11
15
and
truly
if
they
had
been
mindful
of
that
country
from
whence
they
came
out
they
might
have
had
opportunity
to
have
returned
11
16
but
now
they
desire
a
better
country
that
is
an
heavenly
wherefore
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
god
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
city
11
17
by
faith
abraham
when
he
was
tried
offered
up
isaac
and
he
that
had
received
the
promises
offered
up
his
only
begotten
son
11
18
of
whom
it
was
said
that
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
11
19
accounting
that
god
was
able
to
raise
him
up
even
from
the
dead
from
whence
also
he
received
him
in
a
figure
11
20
by
faith
isaac
blessed
jacob
and
esau
concerning
things
to
come
11
21
by
faith
jacob
when
he
was
a
dying
blessed
both
the
sons
of
joseph
and
worshipped
leaning
upon
the
top
of
his
staff
11
22
by
faith
joseph
when
he
died
made
mention
of
the
departing
of
the
children
of
israel
and
gave
commandment
concerning
his
bones
11
23
by
faith
moses
when
he
was
born
was
hid
three
months
of
his
parents
because
they
saw
he
was
a
proper
child
and
they
were
not
afraid
of
the
king’s
commandment
11
24
by
faith
moses
when
he
was
come
to
years
refused
to
be
called
the
son
of
pharaoh’s
daughter
11
25
choosing
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
than
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
sin
for
a
season
11
26
esteeming
the
reproach
of
christ
greater
riches
than
the
treasures
in
egypt
for
he
had
respect
unto
the
recompence
of
the
reward
11
27
by
faith
he
forsook
egypt
not
fearing
the
wrath
of
the
king
for
he
endured
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible
11
28
through
faith
he
kept
the
passover
and
the
sprinkling
of
blood
lest
he
that
destroyed
the
firstborn
should
touch
them
11
29
by
faith
they
passed
through
the
red
sea
as
by
dry
land
which
the
egyptians
assaying
to
do
were
drowned
11
30
by
faith
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
down
after
they
were
compassed
about
seven
days
11
31
by
faith
the
harlot
rahab
perished
not
with
them
that
believed
not
when
she
had
received
the
spies
with
peace
11
32
and
what
shall
i
more
say
for
the
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
gedeon
and
of
barak
and
of
samson
and
of
jephthae
of
david
also
and
samuel
and
of
the
prophets
11
33
who
through
faith
subdued
kingdoms
wrought
righteousness
obtained
promises
stopped
the
mouths
of
lions
11
34
quenched
the
violence
of
fire
escaped
the
edge
of
the
sword
out
of
weakness
were
made
strong
waxed
valiant
in
fight
turned
to
flight
the
armies
of
the
aliens
11
35
women
received
their
dead
raised
to
life
again
and
others
were
tortured
not
accepting
deliverance
that
they
might
obtain
a
better
resurrection
11
36
and
others
had
trial
of
cruel
mockings
and
scourgings
yea
moreover
of
bonds
and
imprisonment
11
37
they
were
stoned
they
were
sawn
asunder
were
tempted
were
slain
with
the
sword
they
wandered
about
in
sheepskins
and
goatskins
being
destitute
afflicted
tormented
11
38
(of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
)
they
wandered
in
deserts
and
in
mountains
and
in
dens
and
caves
of
the
earth
11
39
and
these
all
having
obtained
a
good
report
through
faith
received
not
the
promise
11
40
god
having
provided
some
better
thing
for
us
that
they
without
us
should
not
be
made
perfect
12
1
wherefore
seeing
we
also
are
compassed
about
with
so
great
a
cloud
of
witnesses
let
us
lay
aside
every
weight
and
the
sin
which
doth
so
easily
beset
us
and
let
us
run
with
patience
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
12
2
looking
unto
jesus
the
author
and
finisher
of
our
faith
who
for
the
joy
that
was
set
before
him
endured
the
cross
despising
the
shame
and
is
set
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
12
3
for
consider
him
that
endured
such
contradiction
of
sinners
against
himself
lest
ye
be
wearied
and
faint
in
your
minds
12
4
ye
have
not
yet
resisted
unto
blood
striving
against
sin
12
5
and
ye
have
forgotten
the
exhortation
which
speaketh
unto
you
as
unto
children
my
son
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
lord
nor
faint
when
thou
art
rebuked
of
him
12
6
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
and
scourgeth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth
12
7
if
ye
endure
chastening
god
dealeth
with
you
as
with
sons
for
what
son
is
he
whom
the
father
chasteneth
not
12
8
but
if
ye
be
without
chastisement
whereof
all
are
partakers
then
are
ye
bastards
and
not
sons
12
9
furthermore
we
have
had
fathers
of
our
flesh
which
corrected
us
and
we
gave
them
reverence
shall
we
not
much
rather
be
in
subjection
unto
the
father
of
spirits
and
live
12
10
for
they
verily
for
a
few
days
chastened
us
after
their
own
pleasure
but
he
for
our
profit
that
we
might
be
partakers
of
his
holiness
12
11
now
no
chastening
for
the
present
seemeth
to
be
joyous
but
grievous
nevertheless
afterward
it
yieldeth
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
unto
them
which
are
exercised
thereby
12
12
wherefore
lift
up
the
hands
which
hang
down
and
the
feeble
knees
12
13
and
make
straight
paths
for
your
feet
lest
that
which
is
lame
be
turned
out
of
the
way
but
let
it
rather
be
healed
12
14
follow
peace
with
all
men
and
holiness
without
which
no
man
shall
see
the
lord
12
15
looking
diligently
lest
any
man
fail
of
the
grace
of
god
lest
any
root
of
bitterness
springing
up
trouble
you
and
thereby
many
be
defiled
12
16
lest
there
be
any
fornicator
or
profane
person
as
esau
who
for
one
morsel
of
meat
sold
his
birthright
12
17
for
ye
know
how
that
afterward
when
he
would
have
inherited
the
blessing
he
was
rejected
for
he
found
no
place
of
repentance
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears
12
18
for
ye
are
not
come
unto
the
mount
that
might
be
touched
and
that
burned
with
fire
nor
unto
blackness
and
darkness
and
tempest
12
19
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
the
voice
of
words
which
voice
they
that
heard
intreated
that
the
word
should
not
be
spoken
to
them
any
more
12
20
(for
they
could
not
endure
that
which
was
commanded
and
if
so
much
as
a
beast
touch
the
mountain
it
shall
be
stoned
or
thrust
through
with
a
dart
12
21
and
so
terrible
was
the
sight
that
moses
said
i
exceedingly
fear
and
quake
)
12
22
but
ye
are
come
unto
mount
sion
and
unto
the
city
of
the
living
god
the
heavenly
jerusalem
and
to
an
innumerable
company
of
angels
12
23
to
the
general
assembly
and
church
of
the
firstborn
which
are
written
in
heaven
and
to
god
the
judge
of
all
and
to
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
12
24
and
to
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
and
to
the
blood
of
sprinkling
that
speaketh
better
things
than
that
of
abel
12
25
see
that
ye
refuse
not
him
that
speaketh
for
if
they
escaped
not
who
refused
him
that
spake
on
earth
much
more
shall
not
we
escape
if
we
turn
away
from
him
that
speaketh
from
heaven
12
26
whose
voice
then
shook
the
earth
but
now
he
hath
promised
saying
yet
once
more
i
shake
not
the
earth
only
but
also
heaven
12
27
and
this
word
yet
once
more
signifieth
the
removing
of
those
things
that
are
shaken
as
of
things
that
are
made
that
those
things
which
cannot
be
shaken
may
remain
12
28
wherefore
we
receiving
a
kingdom
which
cannot
be
moved
let
us
have
grace
whereby
we
may
serve
god
acceptably
with
reverence
and
godly
fear
12
29
for
our
god
is
a
consuming
fire
13
1
let
brotherly
love
continue
13
2
be
not
forgetful
to
entertain
strangers
for
thereby
some
have
entertained
angels
unawares
13
3
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
as
bound
with
them
and
them
which
suffer
adversity
as
being
yourselves
also
in
the
body
13
4
marriage
is
honourable
in
all
and
the
bed
undefiled
but
whoremongers
and
adulterers
god
will
judge
13
5
let
your
conversation
be
without
covetousness
and
be
content
with
such
things
as
ye
have
for
he
hath
said
i
will
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
13
6
so
that
we
may
boldly
say
the
lord
is
my
helper
and
i
will
not
fear
what
man
shall
do
unto
me
13
7
remember
them
which
have
the
rule
over
you
who
have
spoken
unto
you
the
word
of
god
whose
faith
follow
considering
the
end
of
their
conversation
13
8
jesus
christ
the
same
yesterday
and
to
day
and
for
ever
13
9
be
not
carried
about
with
divers
and
strange
doctrines
for
it
is
a
good
thing
that
the
heart
be
established
with
grace
not
with
meats
which
have
not
profited
them
that
have
been
occupied
therein
13
10
we
have
an
altar
whereof
they
have
no
right
to
eat
which
serve
the
tabernacle
13
11
for
the
bodies
of
those
beasts
whose
blood
is
brought
into
the
sanctuary
by
the
high
priest
for
sin
are
burned
without
the
camp
13
12
wherefore
jesus
also
that
he
might
sanctify
the
people
with
his
own
blood
suffered
without
the
gate
13
13
let
us
go
forth
therefore
unto
him
without
the
camp
bearing
his
reproach
13
14
for
here
have
we
no
continuing
city
but
we
seek
one
to
come
13
15
by
him
therefore
let
us
offer
the
sacrifice
of
praise
to
god
continually
that
is
the
fruit
of
our
lips
giving
thanks
to
his
name
13
16
but
to
do
good
and
to
communicate
forget
not
for
with
such
sacrifices
god
is
well
pleased
13
17
obey
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you
and
submit
yourselves
for
they
watch
for
your
souls
as
they
that
must
give
account
that
they
may
do
it
with
joy
and
not
with
grief
for
that
is
unprofitable
for
you
13
18
pray
for
us
for
we
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
in
all
things
willing
to
live
honestly
13
19
but
i
beseech
you
the
rather
to
do
this
that
i
may
be
restored
to
you
the
sooner
13
20
now
the
god
of
peace
that
brought
again
from
the
dead
our
lord
jesus
that
great
shepherd
of
the
sheep
through
the
blood
of
the
everlasting
covenant
13
21
make
you
perfect
in
every
good
work
to
do
his
will
working
in
you
that
which
is
wellpleasing
in
his
sight
through
jesus
christ
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
13
22
and
i
beseech
you
brethren
suffer
the
word
of
exhortation
for
i
have
written
a
letter
unto
you
in
few
words
13
23
know
ye
that
our
brother
timothy
is
set
at
liberty
with
whom
if
he
come
shortly
i
will
see
you
13
24
salute
all
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you
and
all
the
saints
they
of
italy
salute
you
13
25
grace
be
with
you
all
amen
the
general
epistle
of
james

1
james
a
servant
of
god
and
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
to
the
twelve
tribes
which
are
scattered
abroad
greeting
1
2
my
brethren
count
it
all
joy
when
ye
fall
into
divers
temptations
1
3
knowing
this
that
the
trying
of
your
faith
worketh
patience
1
4
but
let
patience
have
her
perfect
work
that
ye
may
be
perfect
and
entire
wanting
nothing
1
5
if
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
1
6
but
let
him
ask
in
faith
nothing
wavering
for
he
that
wavereth
is
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
driven
with
the
wind
and
tossed
1
7
for
let
not
that
man
think
that
he
shall
receive
any
thing
of
the
lord
1
8
a
double
minded
man
is
unstable
in
all
his
ways
1
9
let
the
brother
of
low
degree
rejoice
in
that
he
is
exalted
1
10
but
the
rich
in
that
he
is
made
low
because
as
the
flower
of
the
grass
he
shall
pass
away
1
11
for
the
sun
is
no
sooner
risen
with
a
burning
heat
but
it
withereth
the
grass
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
and
the
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
perisheth
so
also
shall
the
rich
man
fade
away
in
his
ways
1
12
blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
for
when
he
is
tried
he
shall
receive
the
crown
of
life
which
the
lord
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him
1
13
let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
i
am
tempted
of
god
for
god
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
1
14
but
every
man
is
tempted
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own
lust
and
enticed
1
15
then
when
lust
hath
conceived
it
bringeth
forth
sin
and
sin
when
it
is
finished
bringeth
forth
death
1
16
do
not
err
my
beloved
brethren
1
17
every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
with
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
1
18
of
his
own
will
begat
he
us
with
the
word
of
truth
that
we
should
be
a
kind
of
firstfruits
of
his
creatures
1
19
wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
let
every
man
be
swift
to
hear
slow
to
speak
slow
to
wrath
1
20
for
the
wrath
of
man
worketh
not
the
righteousness
of
god
1
21
wherefore
lay
apart
all
filthiness
and
superfluity
of
naughtiness
and
receive
with
meekness
the
engrafted
word
which
is
able
to
save
your
souls
1
22
but
be
ye
doers
of
the
word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
your
own
selves
1
23
for
if
any
be
a
hearer
of
the
word
and
not
a
doer
he
is
like
unto
a
man
beholding
his
natural
face
in
a
glass
1
24
for
he
beholdeth
himself
and
goeth
his
way
and
straightway
forgetteth
what
manner
of
man
he
was
1
25
but
whoso
looketh
into
the
perfect
law
of
liberty
and
continueth
therein
he
being
not
a
forgetful
hearer
but
a
doer
of
the
work
this
man
shall
be
blessed
in
his
deed
1
26
if
any
man
among
you
seem
to
be
religious
and
bridleth
not
his
tongue
but
deceiveth
his
own
heart
this
man’s
religion
is
vain
1
27
pure
religion
and
undefiled
before
god
and
the
father
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
2
1
my
brethren
have
not
the
faith
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
lord
of
glory
with
respect
of
persons
2
2
for
if
there
come
unto
your
assembly
a
man
with
a
gold
ring
in
goodly
apparel
and
there
come
in
also
a
poor
man
in
vile
raiment
2
3
and
ye
have
respect
to
him
that
weareth
the
gay
clothing
and
say
unto
him
sit
thou
here
in
a
good
place
and
say
to
the
poor
stand
thou
there
or
sit
here
under
my
footstool
2
4
are
ye
not
then
partial
in
yourselves
and
are
become
judges
of
evil
thoughts
2
5
hearken
my
beloved
brethren
hath
not
god
chosen
the
poor
of
this
world
rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of
the
kingdom
which
he
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him
2
6
but
ye
have
despised
the
poor
do
not
rich
men
oppress
you
and
draw
you
before
the
judgment
seats
2
7
do
not
they
blaspheme
that
worthy
name
by
the
which
ye
are
called
2
8
if
ye
fulfil
the
royal
law
according
to
the
scripture
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
ye
do
well
2
9
but
if
ye
have
respect
to
persons
ye
commit
sin
and
are
convinced
of
the
law
as
transgressors
2
10
for
whosoever
shall
keep
the
whole
law
and
yet
offend
in
one
point
he
is
guilty
of
all
2
11
for
he
that
said
do
not
commit
adultery
said
also
do
not
kill
now
if
thou
commit
no
adultery
yet
if
thou
kill
thou
art
become
a
transgressor
of
the
law
2
12
so
speak
ye
and
so
do
as
they
that
shall
be
judged
by
the
law
of
liberty
2
13
for
he
shall
have
judgment
without
mercy
that
hath
shewed
no
mercy
and
mercy
rejoiceth
against
judgment
2
14
what
doth
it
profit
my
brethren
though
a
man
say
he
hath
faith
and
have
not
works
can
faith
save
him
2
15
if
a
brother
or
sister
be
naked
and
destitute
of
daily
food
2
16
and
one
of
you
say
unto
them
depart
in
peace
be
ye
warmed
and
filled
notwithstanding
ye
give
them
not
those
things
which
are
needful
to
the
body
what
doth
it
profit
2
17
even
so
faith
if
it
hath
not
works
is
dead
being
alone
2
18
yea
a
man
may
say
thou
hast
faith
and
i
have
works
shew
me
thy
faith
without
thy
works
and
i
will
shew
thee
my
faith
by
my
works
2
19
thou
believest
that
there
is
one
god
thou
doest
well
the
devils
also
believe
and
tremble
2
20
but
wilt
thou
know
o
vain
man
that
faith
without
works
is
dead
2
21
was
not
abraham
our
father
justified
by
works
when
he
had
offered
isaac
his
son
upon
the
altar
2
22
seest
thou
how
faith
wrought
with
his
works
and
by
works
was
faith
made
perfect
2
23
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
which
saith
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
imputed
unto
him
for
righteousness
and
he
was
called
the
friend
of
god
2
24
ye
see
then
how
that
by
works
a
man
is
justified
and
not
by
faith
only
2
25
likewise
also
was
not
rahab
the
harlot
justified
by
works
when
she
had
received
the
messengers
and
had
sent
them
out
another
way
2
26
for
as
the
body
without
the
spirit
is
dead
so
faith
without
works
is
dead
also
3
1
my
brethren
be
not
many
masters
knowing
that
we
shall
receive
the
greater
condemnation
3
2
for
in
many
things
we
offend
all
if
any
man
offend
not
in
word
the
same
is
a
perfect
man
and
able
also
to
bridle
the
whole
body
3
3
behold
we
put
bits
in
the
horses’
mouths
that
they
may
obey
us
and
we
turn
about
their
whole
body
3
4
behold
also
the
ships
which
though
they
be
so
great
and
are
driven
of
fierce
winds
yet
are
they
turned
about
with
a
very
small
helm
whithersoever
the
governor
listeth
3
5
even
so
the
tongue
is
a
little
member
and
boasteth
great
things
behold
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
3
6
and
the
tongue
is
a
fire
a
world
of
iniquity
so
is
the
tongue
among
our
members
that
it
defileth
the
whole
body
and
setteth
on
fire
the
course
of
nature
and
it
is
set
on
fire
of
hell
3
7
for
every
kind
of
beasts
and
of
birds
and
of
serpents
and
of
things
in
the
sea
is
tamed
and
hath
been
tamed
of
mankind
3
8
but
the
tongue
can
no
man
tame
it
is
an
unruly
evil
full
of
deadly
poison
3
9
therewith
bless
we
god
even
the
father
and
therewith
curse
we
men
which
are
made
after
the
similitude
of
god
3
10
out
of
the
same
mouth
proceedeth
blessing
and
cursing
my
brethren
these
things
ought
not
so
to
be
3
11
doth
a
fountain
send
forth
at
the
same
place
sweet
water
and
bitter
3
12
can
the
fig
tree
my
brethren
bear
olive
berries
either
a
vine
figs
so
can
no
fountain
both
yield
salt
water
and
fresh
3
13
who
is
a
wise
man
and
endued
with
knowledge
among
you
let
him
shew
out
of
a
good
conversation
his
works
with
meekness
of
wisdom
3
14
but
if
ye
have
bitter
envying
and
strife
in
your
hearts
glory
not
and
lie
not
against
the
truth
3
15
this
wisdom
descendeth
not
from
above
but
is
earthly
sensual
devilish
3
16
for
where
envying
and
strife
is
there
is
confusion
and
every
evil
work
3
17
but
the
wisdom
that
is
from
above
is
first
pure
then
peaceable
gentle
and
easy
to
be
intreated
full
of
mercy
and
good
fruits
without
partiality
and
without
hypocrisy
3
18
and
the
fruit
of
righteousness
is
sown
in
peace
of
them
that
make
peace
4
1
from
whence
come
wars
and
fightings
among
you
come
they
not
hence
even
of
your
lusts
that
war
in
your
members
4
2
ye
lust
and
have
not
ye
kill
and
desire
to
have
and
cannot
obtain
ye
fight
and
war
yet
ye
have
not
because
ye
ask
not
4
3
ye
ask
and
receive
not
because
ye
ask
amiss
that
ye
may
consume
it
upon
your
lusts
4
4
ye
adulterers
and
adulteresses
know
ye
not
that
the
friendship
of
the
world
is
enmity
with
god
whosoever
therefore
will
be
a
friend
of
the
world
is
the
enemy
of
god
4
5
do
ye
think
that
the
scripture
saith
in
vain
the
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
us
lusteth
to
envy
4
6
but
he
giveth
more
grace
wherefore
he
saith
god
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
humble
4
7
submit
yourselves
therefore
to
god
resist
the
devil
and
he
will
flee
from
you
4
8
draw
nigh
to
god
and
he
will
draw
nigh
to
you
cleanse
your
hands
ye
sinners
and
purify
your
hearts
ye
double
minded
4
9
be
afflicted
and
mourn
and
weep
let
your
laughter
be
turned
to
mourning
and
your
joy
to
heaviness
4
10
humble
yourselves
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
lift
you
up
4
11
speak
not
evil
one
of
another
brethren
he
that
speaketh
evil
of
his
brother
and
judgeth
his
brother
speaketh
evil
of
the
law
and
judgeth
the
law
but
if
thou
judge
the
law
thou
art
not
a
doer
of
the
law
but
a
judge
4
12
there
is
one
lawgiver
who
is
able
to
save
and
to
destroy
who
art
thou
that
judgest
another
4
13
go
to
now
ye
that
say
to
day
or
to
morrow
we
will
go
into
such
a
city
and
continue
there
a
year
and
buy
and
sell
and
get
gain
4
14
whereas
ye
know
not
what
shall
be
on
the
morrow
for
what
is
your
life
it
is
even
a
vapour
that
appeareth
for
a
little
time
and
then
vanisheth
away
4
15
for
that
ye
ought
to
say
if
the
lord
will
we
shall
live
and
do
this
or
that
4
16
but
now
ye
rejoice
in
your
boastings
all
such
rejoicing
is
evil
4
17
therefore
to
him
that
knoweth
to
do
good
and
doeth
it
not
to
him
it
is
sin
5
1
go
to
now

rich
men

and
howl
for
your
miseries

shall
come
upon
you
5

corrupted
and
your
garments
are
motheaten
5
3
your
gold
and
silver
is
cankered
and
the
rust
of
them
shall
be
a
witness
against
you
and
shall
eat
your
flesh
as
it
were

ye
have
heaped
treasure
together
for
the
last
days
5

behold
the
hire
of
the
labourers
who
have
reaped
down
your
fields
which
is
of
you
kept
back
by
fraud
crieth
and
the
cries
of
them
which
have
reaped
are
entered
into
the
ears
of
the
lord
of
sabaoth
5
5
ye
have
lived
in
pleasure
on
the
earth
and
been
wanton
ye
have
nourished
your
hearts
as
in
a
day
of
slaughter
5

ye
have
condemned
and
killed
the
just
and
he
doth
not

be
patient
therefore

unto
the
coming
of
the

lest

door
5
10
take
my
brethren
the
prophets
who
have
spoken
in
the
name
of
the
lord
for
an
example
of
suffering
affliction
and
of
patience
5
11
behold

count
them
happy
which
endure
ye
have
heard
of
the
patience

and
have
seen
the
end
of
the
lord
that
the
lord
is
very
pitiful
and
of
tender
mercy
5
12
but
above
all
things
my
brethren
swear
not
neither
by
heaven
neither
by
the
earth
neither
by
any
other
oath
but
let
your

let
them
pray
over
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in

elias
was
a

earnestly
that

not
rain
and
it
rained
not
on
the
earth
by
the
space
of
three
years
and
six
months

and

gave
rain
and

forth
her
fruit

brethren
if
any

let
him
know
that
he
which

which
according
to
his
abundant

hath
begotten
us
again
unto
a
lively
hope
by
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
from
the
dead
1

to
an
inheritance
incorruptible
and
undefiled
and
that
fadeth

reserved
in

for
you
1

who
are
kept
by
the
power
of
god
through
faith
unto
salvation
ready
to
be
revealed
in
the
last
time
1
6
wherein
ye
greatly
rejoice
though
now
for
a
season
if
need
be
ye
are
in
heaviness
through
manifold
temptations
1
7
that
the
trial
of
your
faith
being
much
more
precious
than
of
gold
that
perisheth
though
it
be
tried
with
fire
might
be
found
unto
praise
and
honour
and
glory
at
the
appearing
of
jesus
christ
1
8
whom
having
not
seen
ye
love
in
whom
though
now
ye
see
him
not
yet
believing
ye
rejoice
with
joy
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory
1
9
receiving
the
end
of
your
faith
even
the
salvation
of
your
souls
1
10
of
which
salvation
the
prophets
have
enquired
and
searched
diligently
who
prophesied
of
the
grace
that
should
come
unto
you
1
11
searching
what
or
what
manner
of
time
the
spirit
of
christ
which
was
in
them
did
signify
when
it
testified
beforehand
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
the
glory
that
should
follow
1
12
unto
whom
it
was
revealed
that
not
unto
themselves
but
unto
us
they
did
minister
the
things
which
are
now
reported
unto
you
by
them
that
have
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
with
the
holy
ghost
sent
down
from
heaven
which
things
the
angels
desire
to
look
into
1
13
wherefore
gird
up
the
loins
of
your
mind
be
sober
and
hope
to
the
end
for
the
grace
that
is
to
be
brought
unto
you
at
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
1
14
as
obedient
children
not
fashioning
yourselves
according
to
the
former
lusts
in
your
ignorance
1
15
but
as
he
which
hath
called
you
is
holy
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation
1
16
because
it
is
written
be
ye
holy
for
i
am
holy
1
17
and
if
ye
call
on
the
father
who
without
respect
of
persons
judgeth
according
to
every
man’s
work
pass
the
time
of
your
sojourning
here
in
fear
1
18
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
ye
were
not
redeemed
with
corruptible
things
as
silver
and
gold
from
your
vain
conversation
received
by
tradition
from
your
fathers
1
19
but
with
the
precious
blood
of
christ
as
of
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
spot
1
20
who
verily
was
foreordained
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
was
manifest
in
these
last
times
for
you
1
21
who
by
him
do
believe
in
god
that
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
and
gave
him
glory
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
god
1
22
seeing
ye
have
purified
your
souls
in
obeying
the
truth
through
the
spirit
unto
unfeigned
love
of
the
brethren
see
that
ye
love
one
another
with
a
pure
heart
fervently
1
23
being
born
again
not
of
corruptible
seed
but
of
incorruptible
by
the
word
of
god
which
liveth
and
abideth
for
ever
1
24
for
all
flesh
is
as
grass
and
all
the
glory
of
man
as
the
flower
of
grass
the
grass
withereth
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
away
1
25
but
the
word
of
the
lord
endureth
for
ever
and
this
is
the
word
which
by
the
gospel
is
preached
unto
you
2
1
wherefore
laying
aside
all
malice
and
all
guile
and
hypocrisies
and
envies
all
evil
speakings
2
2
as
newborn
babes
desire
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
that
ye
may
grow
thereby
2
3
if
so
be
ye
have
tasted
that
the
lord
is
gracious
2
4
to
whom
coming
as
unto
a
living
stone
disallowed
indeed
of
men
but
chosen
of
god
and
precious
2
5
ye
also
as
lively
stones
are
built
up
a
spiritual
house
an
holy
priesthood
to
offer
up
spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to
god
by
jesus
christ
2
6
wherefore
also
it
is
contained
in
the
scripture
behold
i
lay
in
sion
a
chief
corner
stone
elect
precious
and
he
that
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
confounded
2
7
unto
you
therefore
which
believe
he
is
precious
but
unto
them
which
be
disobedient
the
stone
which
the
builders
disallowed
the
same
is
made
the
head
of
the
corner
2
8
and
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
a
rock
of
offence
even
to
them
which
stumble
at
the
word
being
disobedient
whereunto
also
they
were
appointed
2
9
but
ye
are
a
chosen
generation
a
royal
priesthood
an
holy
nation
a
peculiar
people
that
ye
should
shew
forth
the
praises
of
him
who
hath
called
you
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light
2
10
which
in
time
past
were
not
a
people
but
are
now
the
people
of
god
which
had
not
obtained
mercy
but
now
have
obtained
mercy
2
11
dearly
beloved
i
beseech
you
as
strangers
and
pilgrims
abstain
from
fleshly
lusts
which
war
against
the
soul
2
12
having
your
conversation
honest
among
the
gentiles
that
whereas
they
speak
against
you
as
evildoers
they
may
by
your
good
works
which
they
shall
behold
glorify
god
in
the
day
of
visitation
2
13
submit
yourselves
to
every
ordinance
of
man
for
the
lord’s
sake
whether
it
be
to
the
king
as
supreme
2
14
or
unto
governors
as
unto
them
that
are
sent
by
him
for
the
punishment
of
evildoers
and
for
the
praise
of
them
that
do
well
2
15
for
so
is
the
will
of
god
that
with
well
doing
ye
may
put
to
silence
the
ignorance
of
foolish
men
2
16
as
free
and
not
using
your
liberty
for
a
cloke
of
maliciousness
but
as
the
servants
of
god
2
17
honour
all
men
love
the
brotherhood
fear
god
honour
the
king
2
18
servants
be
subject
to
your
masters
with
all
fear
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to
the
froward
2
19
for
this
is
thankworthy
if
a
man
for
conscience
toward
god
endure
grief
suffering
wrongfully
2
20
for
what
glory
is
it
if
when
ye
be
buffeted
for
your
faults
ye
shall
take
it
patiently
but
if
when
ye
do
well
and
suffer
for
it
ye
take
it
patiently
this
is
acceptable
with
god
2
21
for
even
hereunto
were
ye
called
because
christ
also
suffered
for
us
leaving
us
an
example
that
ye
should
follow
his
steps
2
22
who
did
no
sin
neither
was
guile
found
in
his
mouth
2
23
who
when
he
was
reviled
reviled
not
again
when
he
suffered
he
threatened
not
but
committed
himself
to
him
that
judgeth
righteously
2
24
who
his
own
self
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
that
we
being
dead
to
sins
should
live
unto
righteousness
by
whose
stripes
ye
were
healed
2
25
for
ye
were
as
sheep
going
astray
but
are
now
returned
unto
the
shepherd
and
bishop
of
your
souls
3
1
likewise
ye
wives
be
in
subjection
to
your
own
husbands
that
if
any
obey
not
the
word
they
also
may
without
the
word
be
won
by
the
conversation
of
the
wives
3
2
while
they
behold
your
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
fear
3
3
whose
adorning
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
plaiting
the
hair
and
of
wearing
of
gold
or
of
putting
on
of
apparel
3
4
but
let
it
be
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
in
that
which
is
not
corruptible
even
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
in
the
sight
of
god
of
great
price
3
5
for
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time
the
holy
women
also
who
trusted
in
god
adorned
themselves
being
in
subjection
unto
their
own
husbands
3
6
even
as
sara
obeyed
abraham
calling
him
lord
whose
daughters
ye
are
as
long
as
ye
do
well
and
are
not
afraid
with
any
amazement
3
7
likewise
ye
husbands
dwell
with
them
according
to
knowledge
giving
honour
unto
the
wife
as
unto
the
weaker
vessel
and
as
being
heirs
together
of
the
grace
of
life
that
your
prayers
be
not
hindered
3
8
finally
be
ye
all
of
one
mind
having
compassion
one
of
another
love
as
brethren
be
pitiful
be
courteous
3
9
not
rendering
evil
for
evil
or
railing
for
railing
but
contrariwise
blessing
knowing
that
ye
are
thereunto
called
that
ye
should
inherit
a
blessing
3
10
for
he
that
will
love
life
and
see
good
days
let
him
refrain
his
tongue
from
evil
and
his
lips
that
they
speak
no
guile
3
11
let
him
eschew
evil
and
do
good
let
him
seek
peace
and
ensue
it
3
12
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
over
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
prayers
but
the
face
of
the
lord
is
against
them
that
do
evil
3
13
and
who
is
he
that
will
harm
you
if
ye
be
followers
of
that
which
is
good
3
14
but
and
if
ye
suffer
for
righteousness’
sake
happy
are
ye
and
be
not
afraid
of
their
terror
neither
be
troubled
3
15
but
sanctify
the
lord
god
in
your
hearts
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that
asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear
3
16
having
a
good
conscience
that
whereas
they
speak
evil
of
you
as
of
evildoers
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your
good
conversation
in
christ
3
17
for
it
is
better
if
the
will
of
god
be
so
that
ye
suffer
for
well
doing
than
for
evil
doing
3
18
for
christ
also
hath
once
suffered
for
sins
the
just
for
the
unjust
that
he
might
bring
us
to
god
being
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
quickened
by
the
spirit
3
19
by
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
3
20
which
sometime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
longsuffering
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
while
the
ark
was
a
preparing
wherein
few
that
is
eight
souls
were
saved
by
water
3
21
the
like
figure
whereunto
even
baptism
doth
also
now
save
us
(not
the
putting
away
of
the
filth
of
the
flesh
but
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
toward
god
)
by
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
3
22
who
is
gone
into
heaven
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
god
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
being
made
subject
unto
him
4
1
forasmuch
then
as
christ
hath
suffered
for
us
in
the
flesh
arm
yourselves
likewise
with
the
same
mind
for
he
that
hath
suffered
in
the
flesh
hath
ceased
from
sin
4
2
that
he
no
longer
should
live
the
rest
of
his
time
in
the
flesh
to
the
lusts
of
men
but
to
the
will
of
god
4
3
for
the
time
past
of
our
life
may
suffice
us
to
have
wrought
the
will
of
the
gentiles
when
we
walked
in
lasciviousness
lusts
excess
of
wine
revellings
banquetings
and
abominable
idolatries
4
4
wherein
they
think
it
strange
that
ye
run
not
with
them
to
the
same
excess
of
riot
speaking
evil
of
you
4
5
who
shall
give
account
to
him
that
is
ready
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
4
6
for
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that
are
dead
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
but
live
according
to
god
in
the
spirit
4
7
but
the
end
of
all
things
is
at
hand
be
ye
therefore
sober
and
watch
unto
prayer
4
8
and
above
all
things
have
fervent
charity
among
yourselves
for
charity
shall
cover
the
multitude
of
sins
4
9
use
hospitality
one
to
another
without
grudging
4
10
as
every
man
hath
received
the
gift
even
so
minister
the
same
one
to
another
as
good
stewards
of
the
manifold
grace
of
god
4
11
if
any
man
speak
let
him
speak
as
the
oracles
of
god
if
any
man
minister
let
him
do
it
as
of
the
ability
which
god
giveth
that
god
in
all
things
may
be
glorified
through
jesus
christ
to
whom
be
praise
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever
amen
4
12
beloved
think
it
not
strange
concerning
the
fiery
trial
which
is
to
try
you
as
though
some
strange
thing
happened
unto
you
4
13
but
rejoice
inasmuch
as
ye
are
partakers
of
christ’s
sufferings
that
when
his
glory
shall
be
revealed
ye
may
be
glad
also
with
exceeding
joy
4
14
if
ye
be
reproached
for
the
name
of
christ
happy
are
ye
for
the
spirit
of
glory
and
of
god
resteth
upon
you
on
their
part
he
is
evil
spoken
of
but
on
your
part
he
is
glorified
4
15
but
let
none
of
you
suffer
as
a
murderer
or
as
a
thief
or
as
an
evildoer
or
as
a
busybody
in
other
men’s
matters
4
16
yet
if
any
man
suffer
as
a
christian
let
him
not
be
ashamed
but
let
him
glorify
god
on
this
behalf
4
17
for
the
time
is
come
that
judgment
must
begin
at
the
house
of
god
and
if
it
first
begin
at
us
what
shall
the
end
be
of
them
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
god
4
18
and
if
the
righteous
scarcely
be
saved
where
shall
the
ungodly
and
the
sinner
appear
4
19
wherefore
let
them
that
suffer
according
to
the
will
of
god
commit
the
keeping
of
their
souls
to
him
in
well
doing
as
unto
a
faithful
creator
5
1
the
elders
which
are
among
you
i
exhort
who
am
also
an
elder
and
a
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
also
a
partaker
of
the
glory
that
shall
be
revealed
5

feed
the
flock
of
god
which
is
among
you
taking
the
oversight
thereof
not
by
constraint
but
willingly
not
for
filthy
lucre
but
of
a
ready
mind
5
3
neither
as
being
lords
over
god’s
heritage
but
being
ensamples
to
the
flock
5
4
and
when
the
chief
shepherd
shall
appear
ye
shall
receive
a
crown
of
glory
that
fadeth
not
away
5
5
likewise
ye
younger
submit
yourselves
unto
the
elder
yea
all
of
you
be
subject
one
to
another
and
be
clothed
with
humility
for
god
resisteth
the
proud
and
giveth
grace
to
the
humble
5

humble
yourselves
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
of
god
that
he
may
exalt
you
in
due
time
5
7
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
5
8
be
sober
be
vigilant
because
your
adversary
the
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
walketh
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
5
9
whom
resist
stedfast
in
the
faith
knowing
that
the
same
afflictions
are
accomplished
in
your
brethren
that
are
in
the
world
5

but
the
god
of
all
grace
who
hath
called
us
unto
his
eternal
glory
by
christ
jesus
after
that
ye
have
suffered
a

perfect

5

by
silvanus
a
faithful
brother
unto
you
as
i
suppose
i
have
written
briefly
exhorting
and
testifying
that
this
is
the
true
grace
of
god
wherein
ye
stand
5
13
the
church
that
is
at
babylon
elected
together
with
you
saluteth
you
and
so
doth
marcus
my
son
5

greet
ye
one
another
with
a
kiss
of
charity
peace
be
with
you
all
that
are
in

amen
the
second
general
epistle
of
peter
1
1
simon
peter
a
servant
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
righteousness
of
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
1
2
grace
and
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
through
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
jesus
our
lord
1
3
according
as
his
divine
power
hath
given
unto
us
all
things
that
pertain
unto
life
and
godliness
through
the
knowledge
of
him
that
hath
called
us
to
glory
and
virtue
1
4
whereby
are
given
unto
us
exceeding
great
and
precious
promises
that
by
these
ye
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
nature
having
escaped
the
corruption
that
is
in
the
world
through
lust
1
5
and
beside
this
giving
all
diligence
add
to
your
faith
virtue
and
to
virtue
knowledge
1
6
and
to
knowledge
temperance
and
to
temperance
patience
and
to
patience
godliness
1
7
and
to
godliness
brotherly
kindness
and
to
brotherly
kindness
charity
1
8
for
if
these
things
be
in
you
and
abound
they
make
you
that
ye
shall
neither
be
barren
nor
unfruitful
in
the
knowledge
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
1
9
but
he
that
lacketh
these
things
is
blind
and
cannot
see
afar
off
and
hath
forgotten
that
he
was
purged
from
his
old
sins
1
10
wherefore
the
rather
brethren
give
diligence
to
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
for
if
ye
do
these
things
ye
shall
never
fall
1
11
for
so
an
entrance
shall
be
ministered
unto
you
abundantly
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
1
12
wherefore
i
will
not
be
negligent
to
put
you
always
in
remembrance
of
these
things
though
ye
know
them
and
be
established
in
the
present
truth
1
13
yea
i
think
it
meet
as
long
as
i
am
in
this
tabernacle
to
stir
you
up
by
putting
you
in
remembrance
1
14
knowing
that
shortly
i
must
put
off
this
my
tabernacle
even
as
our
lord
jesus
christ
hath
shewed
me
1
15
moreover
i
will
endeavour
that
ye
may
be
able
after
my
decease
to
have
these
things
always
in
remembrance
1
16
for
we
have
not
followed
cunningly
devised
fables
when
we
made
known
unto
you
the
power
and
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
but
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
majesty
1
17
for
he
received
from
god
the
father
honour
and
glory
when
there
came
such
a
voice
to
him
from
the
excellent
glory
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
1
18
and
this
voice
which
came
from
heaven
we
heard
when
we
were
with
him
in
the
holy
mount
1
19
we
have
also
a
more
sure
word
of
prophecy
whereunto
ye
do
well
that
ye
take
heed
as
unto
a
light
that
shineth
in
a
dark
place
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
day
star
arise
in
your
hearts
1
20
knowing
this
first
that
no
prophecy
of
the
scripture
is
of
any
private
interpretation
1
21
for
the
prophecy
came
not
in
old
time
by
the
will
of
man
but
holy
men
of
god
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
2
1
but
there
were
false
prophets
also
among
the
people
even
as
there
shall
be
false
teachers
among
you
who
privily
shall
bring
in
damnable
heresies
even
denying
the
lord
that
bought
them
and
bring
upon
themselves
swift
destruction
2
2
and
many
shall
follow
their
pernicious
ways
by
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
evil
spoken
of
2
3
and
through
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
of
you
whose
judgment
now
of
a
long
time
lingereth
not
and
their
damnation
slumbereth
not
2
4
for
if
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment
2
5
and
spared
not
the
old
world
but
saved
noah
the
eighth
person
a
preacher
of
righteousness
bringing
in
the
flood
upon
the
world
of
the
ungodly
2
6
and
turning
the
cities
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
into
ashes
condemned
them
with
an
overthrow
making
them
an
ensample
unto
those
that
after
should
live
ungodly
2
7
and
delivered
just
lot
vexed
with
the
filthy
conversation
of
the
wicked
2
8
(for
that
righteous
man
dwelling
among
them
in
seeing
and
hearing
vexed
his
righteous
soul
from
day
to
day
with
their
unlawful
deeds
)
2
9
the
lord
knoweth
how
to
deliver
the
godly
out
of
temptations
and
to
reserve
the
unjust
unto
the
day
of
judgment
to
be
punished
2
10
but
chiefly
them
that
walk
after
the
flesh
in
the
lust
of
uncleanness
and
despise
government
presumptuous
are
they
selfwilled
they
are
not
afraid
to
speak
evil
of
dignities
2
11
whereas
angels
which
are
greater
in
power
and
might
bring
not
railing
accusation
against
them
before
the
lord
2
12
but
these
as
natural
brute
beasts
made
to
be
taken
and
destroyed
speak
evil
of
the
things
that
they
understand
not
and
shall
utterly
perish
in
their
own
corruption
2
13
and
shall
receive
the
reward
of
unrighteousness
as
they
that
count
it
pleasure
to
riot
in
the
day
time
spots
they
are
and
blemishes
sporting
themselves
with
their
own
deceivings
while
they
feast
with
you
2
14
having
eyes
full
of
adultery
and
that
cannot
cease
from
sin
beguiling
unstable
souls
an
heart
they
have
exercised
with
covetous
practices
cursed
children
2
15
which
have
forsaken
the
right
way
and
are
gone
astray
following
the
way
of
balaam
the
son
of
bosor
who
loved
the
wages
of
unrighteousness
2
16
but
was
rebuked
for
his
iniquity
the
dumb
ass
speaking
with
man’s
voice
forbad
the
madness
of
the
prophet
2
17
these
are
wells
without
water
clouds
that
are
carried
with
a
tempest
to
whom
the
mist
of
darkness
is
reserved
for
ever
2
18
for
when
they
speak
great
swelling
words
of
vanity
they
allure
through
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
through
much
wantonness
those
that
were
clean
escaped
from
them
who
live
in
error
2
19
while
they
promise
them
liberty
they
themselves
are
the
servants
of
corruption
for
of
whom
a
man
is
overcome
of
the
same
is
he
brought
in
bondage
2
20
for
if
after
they
have
escaped
the
pollutions
of
the
world
through
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
they
are
again
entangled
therein
and
overcome
the
latter
end
is
worse
with
them
than
the
beginning
2
21
for
it
had
been
better
for
them
not
to
have
known
the
way
of
righteousness
than
after
they
have
known
it
to
turn
from
the
holy
commandment
delivered
unto
them
2
22
but
it
is
happened
unto
them
according
to
the
true
proverb
the
dog
is
turned
to
his
own
vomit
again
and
the
sow
that
was
washed
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire
3
1
this
second
epistle
beloved
i
now
write
unto
you
in
both
which
i
stir
up
your
pure
minds
by
way
of
remembrance
3
2
that
ye
may
be
mindful
of
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
by
the
holy
prophets
and
of
the
commandment
of
us
the
apostles
of
the
lord
and
saviour
3
3
knowing
this
first
that
there
shall
come
in
the
last
days
scoffers
walking
after
their
own
lusts
3
4
and
saying
where
is
the
promise
of
his
coming
for
since
the
fathers
fell
asleep
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
3
5
for
this
they
willingly
are
ignorant
of
that
by
the
word
of
god
the
heavens
were
of
old
and
the
earth
standing
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
water
3
6
whereby
the
world
that
then
was
being
overflowed
with
water
perished
3
7
but
the
heavens
and
the
earth
which
are
now
by
the
same
word
are
kept
in
store
reserved
unto
fire
against
the
day
of
judgment
and
perdition
of
ungodly
men
3
8
but
beloved
be
not
ignorant
of
this
one
thing
that
one
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
3
9
the
lord
is
not
slack
concerning
his
promise
as
some
men
count
slackness
but
is
longsuffering
to
us-ward
not
willing
that
any
should
perish
but
that
all
should
come
to
repentance
3
10
but
the
day
of
the
lord
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
night
in
the
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
noise
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
up
3
11
seeing
then
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved
what
manner
of
persons
ought
ye
to
be
in
all
holy
conversation
and
godliness
3
12
looking
for
and
hasting
unto
the
coming
of
the
day
of
god
wherein
the
heavens
being
on
fire
shall
be
dissolved
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
3
13
nevertheless
we
according
to
his
promise
look
for
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
3
14
wherefore
beloved
seeing
that
ye
look
for
such
things
be
diligent
that
ye
may
be
found
of
him
in
peace
without
spot
and
blameless
3
15
and
account
that
the
longsuffering
of
our
lord
is
salvation
even
as
our
beloved
brother
paul
also
according
to
the
wisdom
given
unto
him
hath
written
unto
you
3
16
as
also
in
all
his
epistles
speaking
in
them
of
these
things
in
which
are
some
things
hard
to
be
understood
which
they
that
are
unlearned
and
unstable
wrest
as
they
do
also
the
other
scriptures
unto
their
own
destruction
3
17
ye
therefore
beloved
seeing
ye
know
these
things
before
beware
lest
ye
also
being
led
away
with
the
error
of
the
wicked
fall
from
your
own
stedfastness
3
18
but
grow
in
grace
and
in
the
knowledge
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
to
him
be
glory
both
now
and
for
ever
amen
the
first
epistle
general
of
john
1
1
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes
which
we
have
looked
upon
and
our
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
life
1
2
(for
the
life
was
manifested
and
we
have
seen
it
and
bear
witness
and
shew
unto
you
that
eternal
life
which
was
with
the
father
and
was
manifested
unto
us
)
1
3
that
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
declare
we
unto
you
that
ye
also
may
have
fellowship
with
us
and
truly
our
fellowship
is
with
the
father
and
with
his
son
jesus
christ
1
4
and
these
things
write
we
unto
you
that
your
joy
may
be
full
1
5
this
then
is
the
message
which
we
have
heard
of
him
and
declare
unto
you
that
god
is
light
and
in
him
is
no
darkness
at
all
1
6
if
we
say
that
we
have
fellowship
with
him
and
walk
in
darkness
we
lie
and
do
not
the
truth
1
7
but
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
one
with
another
and
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
1
8
if
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
1
9
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
1
10
if
we
say
that
we
have
not
sinned
we
make
him
a
liar
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
2
1
my
little
children
these
things
write
i
unto
you
that
ye
sin
not
and
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
jesus
christ
the
righteous
2
2
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
and
not
for
ours
only
but
also
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
2
3
and
hereby
we
do
know
that
we
know
him
if
we
keep
his
commandments
2
4
he
that
saith
i
know
him
and
keepeth
not
his
commandments
is
a
liar
and
the
truth
is
not
in
him
2
5
but
whoso
keepeth
his
word
in
him
verily
is
the
love
of
god
perfected
hereby
know
we
that
we
are
in
him
2
6
he
that
saith
he
abideth
in
him
ought
himself
also
so
to
walk
even
as
he
walked
2
7
brethren
i
write
no
new
commandment
unto
you
but
an
old
commandment
which
ye
had
from
the
beginning
the
old
commandment
is
the
word
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
2
8
again
a
new
commandment
i
write
unto
you
which
thing
is
true
in
him
and
in
you
because
the
darkness
is
past
and
the
true
light
now
shineth
2
9
he
that
saith
he
is
in
the
light
and
hateth
his
brother
is
in
darkness
even
until
now
2
10
he
that
loveth
his
brother
abideth
in
the
light
and
there
is
none
occasion
of
stumbling
in
him
2
11
but
he
that
hateth
his
brother
is
in
darkness
and
walketh
in
darkness
and
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth
because
that
darkness
hath
blinded
his
eyes
2
12
i
write
unto
you
little
children
because
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
for
his
name’s
sake
2
13
i
write
unto
you
fathers
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning
i
write
unto
you
young
men
because
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one
i
write
unto
you
little
children
because
ye
have
known
the
father
2
14
i
have
written
unto
you
fathers
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning
i
have
written
unto
you
young
men
because
ye
are
strong
and
the
word
of
god
abideth
in
you
and
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one
2
15
love
not
the
world
neither
the
things
that
are
in
the
world
if
any
man
love
the
world
the
love
of
the
father
is
not
in
him
2
16
for
all
that
is
in
the
world
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
lust
of
the
eyes
and
the
pride
of
life
is
not
of
the
father
but
is
of
the
world
2
17
and
the
world
passeth
away
and
the
lust
thereof
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
god
abideth
for
ever
2
18
little
children
it
is
the
last
time
and
as
ye
have
heard
that
antichrist
shall
come
even
now
are
there
many
antichrists
whereby
we
know
that
it
is
the
last
time
2
19
they
went
out
from
us
but
they
were
not
of
us
for
if
they
had
been
of
us
they
would
no
doubt
have
continued
with
us
but
they
went
out
that
they
might
be
made
manifest
that
they
were
not
all
of
us
2
20
but
ye
have
an
unction
from
the
holy
one
and
ye
know
all
things
2
21
i
have
not
written
unto
you
because
ye
know
not
the
truth
but
because
ye
know
it
and
that
no
lie
is
of
the
truth
2
22
who
is
a
liar
but
he
that
denieth
that
jesus
is
the
christ
he
is
antichrist
that
denieth
the
father
and
the
son
2
23
whosoever
denieth
the
son
the
same
hath
not
the
father
he
that
acknowledgeth
the
son
hath
the
father
also
2
24
let
that
therefore
abide
in
you
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
if
that
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
shall
remain
in
you
ye
also
shall
continue
in
the
son
and
in
the
father
2
25
and
this
is
the
promise
that
he
hath
promised
us
even
eternal
life
2
26
these
things
have
i
written
unto
you
concerning
them
that
seduce
you
2
27
but
the
anointing
which
ye
have
received
of
him
abideth
in
you
and
ye
need
not
that
any
man
teach
you
but
as
the
same
anointing
teacheth
you
of
all
things
and
is
truth
and
is
no
lie
and
even
as
it
hath
taught
you
ye
shall
abide
in
him
2
28
and
now
little
children
abide
in
him
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
may
have
confidence
and
not
be
ashamed
before
him
at
his
coming
2
29
if
ye
know
that
he
is
righteous
ye
know
that
every
one
that
doeth
righteousness
is
born
of
him
3
1
behold
what
manner
of
love
the
father
hath
bestowed
upon
us
that
we
should
be
called
the
sons
of
god
therefore
the
world
knoweth
us
not
because
it
knew
him
not
3
2
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
3
3
and
every
man
that
hath
this
hope
in
him
purifieth
himself
even
as
he
is
pure
3
4
whosoever
committeth
sin
transgresseth
also
the
law
for
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
law
3
5
and
ye
know
that
he
was
manifested
to
take
away
our
sins
and
in
him
is
no
sin
3
6
whosoever
abideth
in
him
sinneth
not
whosoever
sinneth
hath
not
seen
him
neither
known
him
3
7
little
children
let
no
man
deceive
you
he
that
doeth
righteousness
is
righteous
even
as
he
is
righteous
3
8
he
that
committeth
sin
is
of
the
devil
for
the
devil
sinneth
from
the
beginning
for
this
purpose
the
son
of
god
was
manifested
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
3
9
whosoever
is
born
of
god
doth
not
commit
sin
for
his
seed
remaineth
in
him
and
he
cannot
sin
because
he
is
born
of
god
3
10
in
this
the
children
of
god
are
manifest
and
the
children
of
the
devil
whosoever
doeth
not
righteousness
is
not
of
god
neither
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
3
11
for
this
is
the
message
that
ye
heard
from
the
beginning
that
we
should
love
one
another
3
12
not
as
cain
who
was
of
that
wicked
one
and
slew
his
brother
and
wherefore
slew
he
him
because
his
own
works
were
evil
and
his
brother’s
righteous
3
13
marvel
not
my
brethren
if
the
world
hate
you
3
14
we
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
because
we
love
the
brethren
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
abideth
in
death
3
15
whosoever
hateth
his
brother
is
a
murderer
and
ye
know
that
no
murderer
hath
eternal
life
abiding
in
him
3
16
hereby
perceive
we
the
love
of
god
because
he
laid
down
his
life
for
us
and
we
ought
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
brethren
3
17
but
whoso
hath
this
world’s
good
and
seeth
his
brother
have
need
and
shutteth
up
his
bowels
of
compassion
from
him
how
dwelleth
the
love
of
god
in
him
3
18
my
little
children
let
us
not
love
in
word
neither
in
tongue
but
in
deed
and
in
truth
3
19
and
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth
and
shall
assure
our
hearts
before
him
3
20
for
if
our
heart
condemn
us
god
is
greater
than
our
heart
and
knoweth
all
things
3
21
beloved
if
our
heart
condemn
us
not
then
have
we
confidence
toward
god
3
22
and
whatsoever
we
ask
we
receive
of
him
because
we
keep
his
commandments
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
3
23
and
this
is
his
commandment
that
we
should
believe
on
the
name
of
his
son
jesus
christ
and
love
one
another
as
he
gave
us
commandment
3
24
and
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
and
he
in
him
and
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
by
the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
us
4
1
beloved
believe
not
every
spirit
but
try
the
spirits
whether
they
are
of
god
because
many
false
prophets
are
gone
out
into
the
world
4
2
hereby
know
ye
the
spirit
of
god
every
spirit
that
confesseth
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
of
god
4
3
and
every
spirit
that
confesseth
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
not
of
god
and
this
is
that
spirit
of
antichrist
whereof
ye
have
heard
that
it
should
come
and
even
now
already
is
it
in
the
world
4
4
ye
are
of
god
little
children
and
have
overcome
them
because
greater
is
he
that
is
in
you
than
he
that
is
in
the
world
4
5
they
are
of
the
world
therefore
speak
they
of
the
world
and
the
world
heareth
them
4
6
we
are
of
god
he
that
knoweth
god
heareth
us
he
that
is
not
of
god
heareth
not
us
hereby
know
we
the
spirit
of
truth
and
the
spirit
of
error
4
7
beloved
let
us
love
one
another
for
love
is
of
god
and
every
one
that
loveth
is
born
of
god
and
knoweth
god
4
8
he
that
loveth
not
knoweth
not
god
for
god
is
love
4
9
in
this
was
manifested
the
love
of
god
toward
us
because
that
god
sent
his
only
begotten
son
into
the
world
that
we
might
live
through
him
4
10
herein
is
love
not
that
we
loved
god
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
4
11
beloved
if
god
so
loved
us
we
ought
also
to
love
one
another
4
12
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
if
we
love
one
another
god
dwelleth
in
us
and
his
love
is
perfected
in
us
4
13
hereby
know
we
that
we
dwell
in
him
and
he
in
us
because
he
hath
given
us
of
his
spirit
4
14
and
we
have
seen
and
do
testify
that
the
father
sent
the
son
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
world
4
15
whosoever
shall
confess
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
god
dwelleth
in
him
and
he
in
god
4
16
and
we
have
known
and
believed
the
love
that
god
hath
to
us
god
is
love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
god
and
god
in
him
4
17
herein
is
our
love
made
perfect
that
we
may
have
boldness
in
the
day
of
judgment
because
as
he
is
so
are
we
in
this
world
4
18
there
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
because
fear
hath
torment
he
that
feareth
is
not
made
perfect
in
love
4
19
we
love
him
because
he
first
loved
us
4
20
if
a
man
say
i
love
god
and
hateth
his
brother
he
is
a
liar
for
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
4
21
and
this
commandment
have
we
from
him
that
he
who
loveth
god
love
his
brother
also
5
1
whosoever
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
christ
is
born
of
god
and
every
one
that
loveth
him
that
begat
loveth
him
also
that
is
begotten
of
him
5
2
by
this
we
know
that
we
love
the
children
of
god
when
we
love
god
and
keep
his
commandments
5
3
for
this
is
the
love
of
god
that
we
keep
his
commandments
and
his
commandments
are
not
grievous
5
4
for
whatsoever
is
born
of
god
overcometh
the
world
and
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
even
our
faith
5
5
who
is
he
that
overcometh
the
world
but
he
that
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
5
6
this
is
he
that
came
by
water
and
blood
even
jesus
christ
not
by
water
only
but
by
water
and
blood
and
it
is
the
spirit
that
beareth
witness
because
the
spirit
is
truth
5
7
for
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
heaven
the
father
the
word
and
the
holy
ghost
and
these
three
are
one
5
8
and
there
are
three
that
bear
witness
in
earth
the
spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
these
three
agree
in
one
5
9
if
we
receive
the
witness
of
men
the
witness
of
god
is
greater
for
this
is
the
witness
of
god
which
he
hath
testified
of
his
son
5
10
he
that
believeth
on
the
son
of
god
hath
the
witness
in
himself
he
that
believeth
not
god
hath
made
him
a
liar
because
he
believeth
not
the
record
that
god
gave
of
his
son
5
11
and
this
is
the
record
that
god
hath
given
to
us
eternal
life
and
this
life
is
in
his
son
5
12
he
that
hath
the
son
hath
life
and
he
that
hath
not
the
son
of
god
hath
not
life
5
13
these
things
have
i
written
unto
you
that
believe
on
the
name
of
the
son
of
god
that
ye
may
know
that
ye
have
eternal
life
and
that
ye
may
believe
on
the
name
of
the
son
of
god
5
14
and
this
is
the
confidence
that
we
have
in
him
that
if
we
ask
any
thing
according
to
his
will
he
heareth
us
5
15
and
if
we
know
that
he
hear
us
whatsoever
we
ask
we
know
that
we
have
the
petitions
that
we
desired
of
him
5
16
if
any
man
see
his
brother
sin
a
sin
which
is
not
unto
death
he
shall
ask
and
he
shall
give
him
life
for
them
that
sin
not
unto
death
there
is
a
sin
unto
death
i
do
not
say
that
he
shall
pray
for
it
5
17
all
unrighteousness
is
sin
and
there
is
a
sin
not
unto
death
5
18
we
know
that
whosoever
is
born
of
god
sinneth
not
but
he
that
is
begotten
of
god
keepeth
himself
and
that
wicked
one
toucheth
him
not
5
19
and
we
know
that
we
are
of
god
and
the
whole
world
lieth
in
wickedness
5
20
and
we
know
that
the
son
of
god
is
come
and
hath
given
us
an
understanding
that
we
may
know
him
that
is
true
and
we
are
in
him
that
is
true
even
in
his
son
jesus
christ
this
is
the
true
god
and
eternal
life

unto
the
elect

i
rejoiced
greatly
that
i
found
of
thy
children
walking
in
truth
as
we
have
received
a
commandment
from
the
father
1
5
and
now
i
beseech
thee
lady
not
as
though
i
wrote
a
new
commandment
unto
thee
but
that
which
we
had
from
the
beginning
that
we
love
one
another
1
6
and
this
is
love
that
we
walk
after
his
commandments
this
is
the
commandment
that
as
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
ye
should
walk
in
it
1
7
for
many
deceivers
are
entered
into
the
world
who
confess
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
this
is
a
deceiver
and
an
antichrist
1
8
look
to
yourselves
that
we
lose
not
those
things
which
we
have
wrought
but
that
we
receive
a
full
reward
1
9
whosoever
transgresseth
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of
christ
hath
not
god
he
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of
christ
he
hath
both
the
father
and
the
son
1
10
if
there
come
any
unto
you
and
bring
not
this
doctrine
receive
him
not
into
your
house
neither
bid
him
god
speed
1
11
for
he
that
biddeth
him
god
speed
is
partaker
of
his
evil
deeds
1
12
having
many
things
to
write
unto
you
i
would
not
write
with
paper
and
ink
but
i
trust
to
come
unto
you
and
speak
face
to
face
that
our
joy
may
be
full

the
children
of
thy
elect
sister
greet
thee
amen
the
third
epistle
general
of
john
1
1
the
elder
unto
the
wellbeloved
gaius
whom
i
love
in
the
truth
1
2
beloved
i
wish
above
all
things
that
thou
mayest
prosper
and
be
in
health
even
as
thy
soul
prospereth
1
3
for
i
rejoiced
greatly
when
the
brethren
came
and
testified
of
the
truth
that
is
in
thee
even
as
thou
walkest
in
the
truth
1
4
i
have
no
greater
joy
than
to
hear
that
my
children
walk
in
truth
1
5
beloved
thou
doest
faithfully
whatsoever
thou
doest
to
the
brethren
and
to
strangers
1
6
which
have
borne
witness
of
thy
charity
before
the
church
whom
if
thou
bring
forward
on
their
journey
after
a
godly
sort
thou
shalt
do
well
1
7
because
that
for
his
name’s
sake
they
went
forth
taking
nothing
of
the
gentiles
1
8
we
therefore
ought
to
receive
such
that
we
might
be
fellowhelpers
to
the
truth
1
9
i
wrote
unto
the
church
but
diotrephes
who
loveth
to
have
the
preeminence
among
them
receiveth
us
not
1
10
wherefore
if
i
come
i
will
remember
his
deeds
which
he
doeth
prating
against
us
with
malicious
words
and
not
content
therewith
neither
doth
he
himself
receive
the
brethren
and
forbiddeth
them
that
would
and
casteth
them
out
of
the
church
1
11
beloved
follow
not
that
which
is
evil
but
that
which
is
good
he
that
doeth
good
is
of
god
but
he
that
doeth
evil
hath
not
seen
god
1
12
demetrius
hath
good
report
of
all
men
and
of
the
truth
itself
yea
and
we
also
bear
record
and
ye
know
that
our
record
is
true
1
13
i
had
many
things
to
write
but
i
will
not
with
ink
and
pen
write
unto
thee
1
14
but
i
trust
i
shall
shortly
see
thee
and
we
shall
speak
face
to
face
peace
be
to
thee
our
friends
salute
thee
greet
the
friends
by
name
the
general
epistle
of
jude
1
1
jude
the
servant
of
jesus
christ
and
brother
of
james
to
them
that
are
sanctified
by
god
the
father
and
preserved
in
jesus
christ
and
called
1
2
mercy
unto
you
and
peace
and
love
be
multiplied
1
3
beloved
when
i
gave
all
diligence
to
write
unto
you
of
the
common
salvation
it
was
needful
for
me
to
write
unto
you
and
exhort
you
that
ye
should
earnestly
contend
for
the
faith
which
was
once
delivered
unto
the
saints
1
4
for
there
are
certain
men
crept
in
unawares
who
were
before
of
old
ordained
to
this
condemnation
ungodly
men
turning
the
grace
of
our
god
into
lasciviousness
and
denying
the
only
lord
god
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
1
5
i
will
therefore
put
you
in
remembrance
though
ye
once
knew
this
how
that
the
lord
having
saved
the
people
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
afterward
destroyed
them
that
believed
not
1
6
and
the
angels
which
kept
not
their
first
estate
but
left
their
own
habitation
he
hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
1
7
even
as
sodom
and
gomorrha
and
the
cities
about
them
in
like
manner
giving
themselves
over
to
fornication
and
going
after
strange
flesh
are
set
forth
for
an
example
suffering
the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire
1
8
likewise
also
these
filthy
dreamers
defile
the
flesh
despise
dominion
and
speak
evil
of
dignities
1
9
yet
michael
the
archangel
when
contending
with
the
devil
he
disputed
about
the
body
of
moses
durst
not
bring
against
him
a
railing
accusation
but
said
the
lord
rebuke
thee
1
10
but
these
speak
evil
of
those
things
which
they
know
not
but
what
they
know
naturally
as
brute
beasts
in
those
things
they
corrupt
themselves
1
11
woe
unto
them
for
they
have
gone
in
the
way
of
cain
and
ran
greedily
after
the
error
of
balaam
for
reward
and
perished
in
the
gainsaying
of
core
1
12
these
are
spots
in
your
feasts
of
charity
when
they
feast
with
you
feeding
themselves
without
fear
clouds
they
are
without
water
carried
about
of
winds
trees
whose
fruit
withereth
without
fruit
twice
dead
plucked
up
by
the
roots
1
13
raging
waves
of
the
sea
foaming
out
their
own
shame
wandering
stars
to
whom
is
reserved
the
blackness
of
darkness
for
ever
1
14
and
enoch
also
the
seventh
from
adam
prophesied
of
these
saying
behold
the
lord
cometh
with
ten
thousands
of
his
saints
1
15
to
execute
judgment
upon
all
and
to
convince
all
that
are
ungodly
among
them
of
all
their
ungodly
deeds
which
they
have
ungodly
committed
and
of
all
their
hard
speeches
which
ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
him
1
16
these
are
murmurers
complainers
walking
after
their
own
lusts
and
their
mouth
speaketh
great
swelling
words
having
men’s
persons
in
admiration
because
of
advantage
1
17
but
beloved
remember
ye
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
of
the
apostles
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
1
18
how
that
they
told
you
there
should
be
mockers
in
the
last
time
who
should
walk
after
their
own
ungodly
lusts
1
19
these
be
they
who
separate
themselves
sensual
having
not
the
spirit
1
20
but
ye
beloved
building
up
yourselves
on
your
most
holy
faith
praying
in
the
holy
ghost
1
21
keep
yourselves
in
the
love
of
god
looking
for
the
mercy
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
unto
eternal
life
1
22
and
of
some
have
compassion
making
a
difference
1
23
and
others
save
with
fear
pulling
them
out
of
the
fire
hating
even
the
garment
spotted
by
the
flesh
1
24
now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
keep
you
from
falling
and
to
present
you
faultless
before
the
presence
of
his
glory
with
exceeding
joy
1
25
to
the
only
wise
god
our
saviour

glory
and
majesty

gave
unto
him

must
shortly
come

shall
see
him

pierced
him

earth
shall
wail
because
of
him
even
so
amen

and

saith
the
lord

was

i
john
who
also
am
your
brother
and
companion
in
tribulation
and
in
the
kingdom
and
patience
of
jesus
christ
was
in
the
isle
that
is
called
patmos
for
the
word
of
god
and
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
1
10
i
was
in
the
spirit
on
the
lord’s
day
and
heard
behind
me
a
great
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
1
11
saying
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
first
and
the
last
and
what
thou
seest
write
in
a
book
and
send
it
unto
the
seven
churches
which
are
in
asia
unto
ephesus
and
unto
smyrna
and
unto
pergamos
and
unto
thyatira
and
unto
sardis
and
unto
philadelphia
and
unto
laodicea
1
12
and
i
turned
to
see
the
voice
that
spake
with
me
and
being
turned
i
saw
seven
golden
candlesticks
1
13
and
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
candlesticks
one
like
unto
the
son
of
man
clothed
with
a
garment
down
to
the
foot
and
girt
about
the
paps
with
a
golden
girdle
1
14
his
head
and
his
hairs
were
white
like
wool
as
white
as
snow
and
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
1
15
and
his
feet
like
unto
fine
brass
as
if
they
burned
in
a
furnace
and
his
voice
as
the
sound
of
many
waters
1
16
and
he
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
and
out
of
his
mouth
went
a
sharp
twoedged
sword
and
his
countenance
was
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
strength
1
17
and
when
i
saw
him
i
fell
at
his
feet
as
dead
and
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
me
saying
unto
me
fear
not
i
am
the
first
and
the
last
1
18
i
am
he
that
liveth
and
was
dead
and
behold
i
am
alive
for
evermore
amen
and
have
the
keys
of
hell
and
of
death
1
19
write
the
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
the
things
which
are
and
the
things
which
shall
be
hereafter
1
20
the
mystery
of
the
seven
stars
which
thou
sawest
in
my
right
hand
and
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
the
seven
stars
are
the
angels
of
the
seven
churches
and
the
seven
candlesticks
which
thou
sawest
are

seven
churches

church
of
ephesus
write
these
things
saith
he
that
holdeth
the
seven
stars
in
his
right
hand
who
walketh
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
2
2
i
know
thy
works
and
thy
labour
and
thy
patience
and
how
thou
canst
not
bear
them
which
are
evil
and
thou
hast
tried
them
which
say
they
are
apostles
and
are
not
and
hast
found
them
liars
2
3
and
hast
borne
and
hast
patience
and
for
my
name’s
sake
hast
laboured
and
hast
not
fainted
2
4
nevertheless
i
have
somewhat
against
thee
because
thou
hast
left
thy
first
love
2
5
remember
therefore
from
whence
thou
art
fallen
and
repent
and
do
the
first
works
or
else
i
will
come
unto
thee
quickly
and
will
remove
thy
candlestick
out
of
his
place
except
thou
repent
2
6
but
this
thou
hast
that
thou
hatest
the
deeds
of
the
nicolaitanes
which
i
also
hate
2
7
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
give
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
god
2
8
and
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
smyrna
write
these
things
saith
the
first
and
the
last
which
was
dead
and
is
alive
2
9
i
know
thy
works
and
tribulation
and
poverty
(but
thou
art
rich)
and
i
know
the
blasphemy
of
them
which
say
they
are
jews
and
are
not
but
are
the
synagogue
of
satan
2
10
fear
none
of
those
things
which
thou
shalt
suffer
behold
the
devil
shall
cast
some
of
you
into
prison
that
ye
may
be
tried
and
ye
shall
have
tribulation
ten
days
be
thou
faithful
unto
death
and
i
will
give
thee
a
crown
of
life
2
11
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
he
that
overcometh
shall
not
be
hurt
of
the
second
death
2
12
and
to
the
angel
of
the
church
in
pergamos
write
these
things
saith
he
which
hath
the
sharp
sword
with
two
edges
2
13
i
know
thy
works
and
where
thou
dwellest
even
where
satan’s
seat
is
and
thou
holdest
fast
my
name
and
hast
not
denied
my
faith
even
in
those
days
wherein
antipas
was
my
faithful
martyr
who
was
slain
among
you
where
satan
dwelleth
2
14
but
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
hast
there
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
balaam
who
taught
balac
to
cast
a
stumblingblock
before
the
children
of
israel
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
and
to
commit
fornication
2
15
so
hast
thou
also
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
the
nicolaitanes
which
thing
i
hate
2
16
repent
or
else
i
will
come
unto
thee
quickly
and
will
fight
against
them
with
the
sword
of
my
mouth
2
17
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
give
to
eat
of
the
hidden
manna
and
will
give
him
a
white
stone
and
in
the
stone
a
new
name
written
which
no
man
knoweth
saving
he
that
receiveth
it
2
18
and
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
thyatira
write
these
things
saith
the
son
of
god
who
hath
his
eyes
like
unto
a
flame
of
fire
and
his
feet
are
like
fine
brass
2
19
i
know
thy
works
and
charity
and
service
and
faith
and
thy
patience
and
thy
works
and
the
last
to
be
more
than
the
first
2
20
notwithstanding
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
sufferest
that
woman
jezebel
which
calleth
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
to
seduce
my
servants
to
commit
fornication
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
2
21
and
i
gave
her
space
to
repent
of
her
fornication
and
she
repented
not
2
22
behold
i
will
cast
her
into
a
bed
and
them
that
commit
adultery
with
her
into
great
tribulation
except
they
repent
of
their
deeds
2
23
and
i
will
kill
her
children
with
death
and
all
the
churches
shall
know
that
i
am
he
which
searcheth
the
reins
and
hearts
and
i
will
give
unto
every
one
of
you
according
to
your
works
2
24
but
unto
you
i
say
and
unto
the
rest
in
thyatira
as
many
as
have
not
this
doctrine
and
which
have
not
known
the
depths
of
satan
as
they
speak
i
will
put
upon

in
white
raiment
and
i
will
not
blot
out
his
name
out
of

book
of
life

i
will
confess
his
name
before
my
father
and
before
his
angels
3

he
that

an
ear
let

thy
works
that
thou
art
neither
cold
nor
hot
i
would
thou
wert
cold
or
hot
3
16
so
then
because
thou
art
lukewarm
and
neither
cold
nor
hot
i
will
spue
thee
out
of
my
mouth
3
17
because
thou
sayest
i
am
rich
and
increased
with
goods
and
have
need
of
nothing
and
knowest
not
that
thou
art
wretched
and
miserable
and
poor
and
blind
and
naked
3
18
i
counsel
thee
to
buy
of
me
gold
tried
in
the
fire
that
thou
mayest
be
rich
and
white
raiment
that
thou
mayest
be
clothed
and
that
the
shame
of
thy
nakedness
do
not
appear
and
anoint
thine
eyes
with
eyesalve
that
thou
mayest
see
3
19
as
many
as
i
love
i
rebuke
and
chasten
be
zealous
therefore
and
repent
3
20
behold
i
stand
at
the
door
and
knock
if
any
man
hear
my
voice
and
open
the
door
i
will
come
in
to
him
and
will
sup
with
him
and
he
with
me
3
21
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also
overcame
and
am
set
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
3
22
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
4
1
after
this
i
looked
and
behold
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
which
i
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me
which
said
come
up
hither
and
i
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter
4
2
and
immediately
i
was
in
the
spirit
and
behold
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven
and
one
sat
on
the
throne
4
3
and
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
4
4
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats
and
upon
the
seats
i
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold
4
5
and
out
of
the
throne
proceeded
lightnings
and
thunderings
and
voices
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
throne
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
4
6
and
before
the
throne
there
was
a
sea
of
glass
like
unto
crystal
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
behind
4
7
and
the
first
beast
was
like
a
lion
and
the
second
beast
like
a
calf
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
man
and
the
fourth
beast
was
like
a
flying
eagle
4
8
and
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
him
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
within
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night
saying
holy
holy
holy
lord
god
almighty
which
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
4
9
and
when
those
beasts
give
glory
and
honour
and
thanks
to
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
4
10
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fall
down
before
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
and
worship
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
cast
their
crowns
before
the
throne
saying
4
11
thou
art
worthy
o
lord
to
receive
glory
and
honour
and
power
for
thou
hast
created
all
things
and
for
thy
pleasure
they
are
and
were
created
5
1
and
i
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
a
book
written
within
and
on
the
backside
sealed
with
seven
seals
5
2
and
i
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
voice
who
is
worthy
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seals
thereof
5
3
and
no
man
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
neither
under
the
earth
was
able
to
open
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
5
4
and
i
wept
much
because
no
man
was
found
worthy
to
open
and
to
read
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
5
5
and
one
of
the
elders
saith
unto
me
weep
not
behold
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
juda
the
root
of
david
hath
prevailed
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
thereof
5
6
and
i
beheld
and
lo
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
beasts
and
in
the
midst
of
the
elders
stood
a
lamb
as
it
had
been
slain
having
seven
horns
and
seven
eyes
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
sent
forth
into
all
the
earth
5
7
and
he
came
and
took
the
book
out
of
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
throne
5
8
and
when
he
had
taken
the
book
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
every
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odours
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints
5
9
and
they
sung
a
new
song
saying
thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
book
and
to
open
the
seals
thereof
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
5
10
and
hast
made
us
unto
our
god
kings
and
priests
and
we
shall
reign
on
the
earth
5
11
and
i
beheld
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
elders
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
5
12
saying
with
a
loud
voice
worthy
is
the
lamb
that
was
slain
to
receive
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honour
and
glory
and
blessing
5
13
and
every
creature
which
is
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
such
as
are
in
the
sea
and
all
that
are
in
them
heard
i
saying
blessing
and
honour
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
5
14
and
the
four
beasts
said
amen
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
6
1
and
i
saw
when
the
lamb
opened
one
of
the
seals
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
noise
of
thunder
one
of
the
four
beasts
saying
come
and
see
6
2
and
i
saw
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
bow
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
him
and
he
went
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
6
3
and
when
he
had
opened
the
second
seal
i
heard
the
second
beast
say
come
and
see
6
4
and
there
went
out
another
horse
that
was
red
and
power
was
given
to
him
that
sat
thereon
to
take
peace
from
the
earth
and
that
they
should
kill
one
another
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
great
sword
6
5
and
when
he
had
opened
the
third
seal
i
heard
the
third
beast
say
come
and
see
and
i
beheld
and
lo
a
black
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
pair
of
balances
in
his
hand
6
6
and
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
beasts
say
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
wine
6
7
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fourth
seal
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
beast
say
come
and
see
6
8
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
pale
horse
and
his
name
that
sat
on
him
was
death
and
hell
followed
with
him
and
power
was
given
unto
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth
to
kill
with
sword
and
with
hunger
and
with
death
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
earth
6
9
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fifth
seal
i
saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of
them
that
were
slain
for
the
word
of
god
and
for
the
testimony
which
they
held
6
10
and
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
how
long
o
lord
holy
and
true
dost
thou
not
judge
and
avenge
our
blood
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
6
11
and
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
them
and
it
was
said
unto
them
that
they
should
rest
yet
for
a
little
season
until
their
fellowservants
also
and
their
brethren
that
should
be
killed
as
they
were
should
be
fulfilled
6
12
and
i
beheld
when
he
had
opened
the
sixth
seal
and
lo
there
was
a
great
earthquake
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of
hair
and
the
moon
became
as
blood
6
13
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
unto
the
earth
even
as
a
fig
tree
casteth
her
untimely
figs
when
she
is
shaken
of
a
mighty
wind
6
14
and
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
when
it
is
rolled
together
and
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
places
6
15
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
the
great
men
and
the
rich
men
and
the
chief
captains
and
the
mighty
men
and
every
bondman
and
every
free
man
hid
themselves
in
the
dens
and
in
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
6
16
and
said
to
the
mountains
and
rocks
fall
on
us
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
lamb
6
17
for
the
great
day
of
his
wrath
is
come
and
who
shall
be
able
to
stand
7
1
and
after
these
things
i
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
earth
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
7
2
and
i
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
east
having
the
seal
of
the
living
god
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
sea
7
3
saying
hurt
not
the
earth
neither
the
sea
nor
the
trees
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
god
in
their
foreheads
7
4
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
sealed
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand

after

i
beheld
and
lo
a
great
multitude
which
no
man
could
number
of
all
nations
and
kindreds
and
people
and
tongues
stood
before
the
throne
and
before
the
lamb
clothed
with
white
robes
and
palms
in
their
hands
7
10
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
salvation
to
our
god
which
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
7
11
and
all
the
angels
stood
round
about
the
throne
and
about
the
elders
and
the
four
beasts
and
fell
before
the
throne
on
their
faces
and

12
saying

wisdom
and
thanksgiving
and
honour
and
power
and
might
be
unto

7
13
and
one
of
the
elders
answered
saying
unto
me
what
are
these
which
are
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
whence
came
they
7
14
and
i
said
unto
him
sir
thou
knowest
and
he
said
to
me
these
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
7
15
therefore
are
they
before
the
throne
of
god
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
7
16
they
shall
hunger
no
more
neither
thirst
any
more
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
7
17
for
the
lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
8

and
when
he
had
opened
the
seventh
seal
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
8
2
and
i
saw
the
seven
angels
which
stood
before
god
and
to
them
were
given
seven
trumpets
8
3
and
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar
having
a
golden
censer
and
there
was
given
unto
him
much
incense
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
throne
8
4
and
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
came
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints
ascended
up
before
god
out
of
the
angel’s
hand
8
5
and
the
angel
took
the
censer
and
filled
it
with
fire
of
the
altar
and
cast
it
into
the
earth
and
there
were
voices
and
thunderings
and
lightnings
and
an
earthquake
8
6
and
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
to
sound
8
7
the
first
angel
sounded
and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth
and
the
third
part
of
trees
was
burnt
up
and
all
green
grass
was
burnt
up
8
8
and
the
second
angel
sounded
and
as
it
were
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
the
third
part
of
the
sea
became
blood
8
9
and
the
third
part
of
the
creatures
which
were
in
the
sea
and
had
life
died
and
the
third
part
of
the
ships
were
destroyed
8
10
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven
burning
as
it
were
a
lamp
and
it
fell
upon
the
third
part
of
the
rivers
and
upon
the
fountains
of
waters
8
11
and
the
name
of
the
star
is
called
wormwood
and
the
third
part
of
the
waters
became
wormwood
and
many
men
died
of
the
waters
because
they
were
made
bitter
8
12
and
the
fourth
angel
sounded
and
the
third
part
of
the
sun
was
smitten
and
the
third
part
of
the
moon
and
the
third
part
of
the
stars
so
as
the
third
part
of
them
was
darkened
and
the
day
shone
not
for
a
third
part
of
it
and
the
night
likewise
8
13
and
i
beheld
and
heard
an
angel
flying
through
the
midst
of
heaven
saying
with
a
loud
voice
woe
woe
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet
of
the
three
angels
which
are
yet
to
sound
9
1
and
the
fifth
angel
sounded
and
i
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
and
to
him
was
given
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
9
2
and
he
opened
the
bottomless
pit
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
pit
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace
and
the
sun
and
the
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
pit
9
3
and
there
came
out
of
the
smoke
locusts
upon
the
earth
and
unto
them
was
given
power
as
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
power
9
4
and
it
was
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
hurt
the
grass
of
the
earth
neither
any
green
thing
neither
any
tree
but
only
those
men
which
have
not
the
seal
of
god
in
their
foreheads
9
5
and
to
them
it
was
given
that
they
should
not
kill
them
but
that
they
should
be
tormented
five
months
and
their
torment
was
as
the
torment
of
a
scorpion
when
he
striketh
a
man
9
6
and
in
those
days
shall
men
seek
death
and
shall
not
find
it
and
shall
desire
to
die
and
death
shall
flee
from
them
9
7
and
the
shapes
of
the
locusts
were
like
unto
horses
prepared
unto
battle
and
on
their
heads
were
as
it
were
crowns
like
gold
and
their
faces
were
as
the
faces
of
men
9
8
and
they
had
hair
as
the
hair
of
women
and
their
teeth
were
as
the
teeth
of
lions
9
9
and
they
had
breastplates
as
it
were
breastplates
of
iron
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
as
the
sound
of
chariots
of
many
horses
running
to
battle
9
10
and
they
had
tails
like
unto
scorpions
and
there
were
stings
in
their
tails
and
their
power
was
to
hurt
men
five
months
9
11
and
they
had
a
king
over
them
which
is
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
pit
whose
name
in
the
hebrew
tongue
is
abaddon
but
in
the
greek
tongue
hath
his
name
apollyon
9
12
one
woe
is
past
and
behold
there
come
two
woes
more
hereafter
9
13
and
the
sixth
angel
sounded
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
four
horns
of
the
golden
altar
which
is
before
god
9
14
saying
to
the
sixth
angel
which
had
the
trumpet
loose
the
four
angels
which
are
bound
in
the
great
river
euphrates
9
15
and
the
four
angels
were
loosed
which
were
prepared
for
an
hour
and
a
day
and
a
month
and
a
year
for
to
slay
the
third
part
of
men
9
16
and
the
number
of
the
army
of
the
horsemen
were
two
hundred
thousand
thousand
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
9
17
and
thus
i
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
them
that
sat
on
them
having
breastplates
of
fire
and
of
jacinth
and
brimstone
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
as
the
heads
of
lions
and
out
of
their
mouths
issued
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
9
18
by
these
three
was
the
third
part
of
men
killed
by
the
fire
and
by
the
smoke
and
by
the
brimstone
which
issued
out
of
their
mouths
9
19
for
their
power
is
in
their
mouth
and
in
their
tails
for
their
tails
were
like
unto
serpents
and
had
heads
and
with
them
they
do
hurt
9
20
and
the
rest
of
the
men
which
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
yet
repented
not
of
the
works
of
their
hands
that
they
should
not
worship
devils
and
idols
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass
and
stone
and
of
wood
which
neither
can
see
nor
hear
nor
walk
9
21
neither
repented
they
of
their
murders
nor
of
their
sorceries
nor
of
their
fornication
nor
of
their
thefts
10
1
and
i
saw
another
mighty
angel
come
down
from
heaven
clothed
with
a
cloud
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
head
and
his
face
was
as
it
were
the
sun
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
fire
10
2
and
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
open
and
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
sea
and
his
left
foot
on
the
earth
10
3
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
as
when
a
lion
roareth
and
when
he
had
cried
seven
thunders
uttered
their
voices
10
4
and
when
the
seven
thunders
had
uttered
their
voices
i
was
about
to
write
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
seal
up
those
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered
and
write
them
not
10
5
and
the
angel
which
i
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
10
6
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
who
created
heaven
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
earth
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
sea
and
the
things
which
are
therein
that
there
should
be
time
no
longer
10
7
but
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound
the
mystery
of
god
should
be
finished
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
prophets
10
8
and
the
voice
which
i
heard
from
heaven
spake
unto
me
again
and
said
go
and
take
the
little
book
which
is
open
in
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
standeth
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
10
9
and
i
went
unto
the
angel
and
said
unto
him
give
me
the
little
book
and
he
said
unto
me
take
it
and
eat
it
up
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey
10
10
and
i
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angel’s
hand
and
ate
it
up
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
it
my
belly
was
bitter
10
11
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
11
1
and
there
was
given
me
a
reed
like
unto
a
rod
and
the
angel
stood
saying
rise
and
measure
the
temple
of
god
and
the
altar
and
them
that
worship
therein
11
2
but
the
court
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
out
and
measure
it
not
for
it
is
given
unto
the
gentiles
and
the
holy
city
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
months
11
3
and
i
will
give
power
unto
my
two
witnesses
and
they
shall
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
clothed
in
sackcloth
11
4
these
are
the
two
olive
trees
and
the
two
candlesticks
standing
before
the
god
of
the
earth
11
5
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
fire
proceedeth
out
of
their
mouth
and
devoureth
their
enemies
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
he
must
in
this
manner
be
killed
11
6
these
have
power
to
shut
heaven
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
prophecy
and
have
power
over
waters
to
turn
them
to
blood
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
plagues
as
often
as
they
will
11
7
and
when
they
shall
have
finished
their
testimony
the
beast
that
ascendeth
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
shall
make
war
against
them
and
shall
overcome
them
and
kill
them
11
8
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
city
which
spiritually
is
called
sodom
and
egypt
where
also
our
lord
was
crucified
11
9
and
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
half
and
shall
not
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
graves
11
10
and
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
them
and
make
merry
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
another
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
earth
11
11
and
after
three
days
and
an
half
the
spirit
of
life
from
god
entered
into
them
and
they
stood
upon
their
feet
and
great
fear
fell
upon
them
which
saw
them
11
12
and
they
heard
a
great
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
them
come
up
hither
and
they
ascended
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
and
their
enemies
beheld
them
11
13
and
the
same
hour
was
there
a
great
earthquake
and
the
tenth
part
of
the
city
fell
and
in
the
earthquake
were
slain
of
men
seven
thousand
and
the
remnant
were
affrighted
and
gave
glory
to
the
god
of
heaven
11
14
the
second
woe
is
past
and
behold
the
third
woe
cometh
quickly
11
15
and
the
seventh
angel
sounded
and
there
were
great
voices
in
heaven
saying
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
11
16
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
which
sat
before
god
on
their
seats
fell
upon
their
faces
and
worshipped
god
11
17
saying
we
give
thee
thanks
o
lord
god
almighty
which
art
and
wast
and
art
to
come
because
thou
hast
taken
to
thee
thy
great
power
and
hast
reigned
11
18
and
the
nations
were
angry
and
thy
wrath
is
come
and
the
time
of
the
dead
that
they
should
be
judged
and
that
thou
shouldest
give
reward
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets
and
to
the
saints
and
them
that
fear
thy
name
small
and
great
and
shouldest
destroy
them
which
destroy
the
earth
11
19
and
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
testament
and
there
were
lightnings
and
voices
and
thunderings
and
an
earthquake
and
great
hail
12
1
and
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
12
2
and
she
being
with
child
cried
travailing
in
birth
and
pained
to
be
delivered
12
3
and
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
heaven
and
behold
a
great
red
dragon
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
seven
crowns
upon
his
heads
12
4
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
which
was
ready
to
be
delivered
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
born
12
5
and
she
brought
forth
a
man
child
who
was
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
her
child
was
caught
up
unto
god
and
to
his
throne
12
6
and
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
god
that
they
should
feed
her
there
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
12
7
and
there
was
war
in
heaven
michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
fought
and
his
angels
12
8
and
prevailed
not
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more
in
heaven
12
9
and
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world
he
was
cast
out
into
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
him
12
10
and
i
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
heaven
now
is
come
salvation
and
strength
and
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
the
power
of
his
christ
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down
which
accused
them
before
our
god
day
and
night
12
11
and
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death
12
12
therefore
rejoice
ye
heavens
and
ye
that
dwell
in
them
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time
12
13
and
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
earth
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
child
12
14
and
to
the
woman
were
given
two
wings
of
a
great
eagle
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness
into
her
place
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
from
the
face
of
the
serpent
12
15
and
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
flood
after
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
flood
12
16
and
the
earth
helped
the
woman
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
up
the
flood
which
the
dragon
cast
out
of
his
mouth
12
17
and
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
woman
and
went
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
which
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
13
1
and
i
stood
upon
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
saw
a
beast
rise
up
out
of
the
sea
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
upon
his
horns
ten
crowns
and
upon
his
heads
the
name
of
blasphemy
13
2
and
the
beast
which
i
saw
was
like
unto
a
leopard
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
bear
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion
and
the
dragon
gave
him
his
power
and
his
seat
and
great
authority
13
3
and
i
saw
one
of
his
heads
as
it
were
wounded
to
death
and
his
deadly
wound
was
healed
and
all
the
world
wondered
after
the
beast
13
4
and
they
worshipped
the
dragon
which
gave
power
unto
the
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
beast
saying
who
is
like
unto
the
beast
who
is
able
to
make
war
with
him
13
5
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months
13
6
and
he
opened
his
mouth
in
blasphemy
against
god
to
blaspheme
his
name
and
his
tabernacle
and
them
that
dwell
in
heaven
13
7
and
it
was
given
unto
him
to
make
war
with
the
saints
and
to
overcome
them
and
power
was
given
him
over
all
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
13
8
and
all
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
worship
him
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
of
the
lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
13
9
if
any
man
have
an
ear
let
him
hear
13
10
he
that
leadeth
into
captivity
shall
go
into
captivity
he
that
killeth
with
the
sword
must
be
killed
with
the
sword
here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of
the
saints
13
11
and
i
beheld
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
and
he
had
two
horns
like
a
lamb
and
he
spake
as
a
dragon
13
12
and
he
exerciseth
all
the
power
of
the
first
beast
before
him
and
causeth
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
worship
the
first
beast
whose
deadly
wound
was
healed
13
13
and
he
doeth
great
wonders
so
that
he
maketh
fire
come
down
from
heaven
on
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
men
13
14
and
deceiveth
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
the
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
had
power
to
do
in
the
sight
of
the
beast
saying
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
beast
which
had
the
wound
by
a
sword
and
did
live
13
15
and
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
beast
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
speak
and
cause
that
as
many
as
would
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
should
be
killed
13
16
and
he
causeth
all
both
small
and
great
rich
and
poor
free
and
bond
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
hand
or
in
their
foreheads
13
17
and
that
no
man
might
buy
or
sell
save
he
that
had
the
mark
or
the
name
of
the
beast
or
the
number
of
his
name
13
18
here
is
wisdom
let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
and
his
number
is
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
14
1
and
i
looked
and
lo
a
lamb
stood
on
the
mount
sion
and
with
him
an
hundred
forty
and
four
thousand
having
his
father’s
name
written
in
their
foreheads
14
2
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
a
great
thunder
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
14
3
and
they
sung
as
it
were
a
new
song
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
beasts
and
the
elders
and
no
man
could
learn
that
song
but
the
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
which
were
redeemed
from
the
earth
14
4
these
are
they
which
were
not
defiled
with
women
for
they
are
virgins
these
are
they
which
follow
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth
these
were
redeemed
from
among
men
being
the
firstfruits
unto
god
and
to
the
lamb
14
5
and
in
their
mouth
was
found
no
guile
for
they
are
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
god
14
6
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
14
7
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
14
8
and
there
followed
another
angel
saying
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
that
great
city
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
14
9
and
the
third
angel
followed
them
saying
with
a
loud
voice
if
any
man
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
receive
his
mark
in
his
forehead
or
in
his
hand
14
10
the
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
indignation
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
angels
and
in
the
presence
of
the
lamb
14
11
and
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
they
have
no
rest
day
nor
night
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
whosoever
receiveth
the
mark
of
his
name
14
12
here
is
the
patience
of
the
saints
here
are
they
that
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
faith
of
jesus
14
13
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
write
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labours
and
their
works
do
follow
them
14
14
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
white
cloud
and
upon
the
cloud
one
sat
like
unto
the
son
of
man
having
on
his
head
a
golden
crown
and
in
his
hand
a
sharp
sickle
14
15
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
crying
with
a
loud
voice
to
him
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
thy
sickle
and
reap
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
reap
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth
is
ripe
14
16
and
he
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
his
sickle
on
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
reaped
14
17
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
which
is
in
heaven
he
also
having
a
sharp
sickle
14
18
and
another
angel
came
out
from
the
altar
which
had
power
over
fire
and
cried
with
a
loud
cry
to
him
that
had
the
sharp
sickle
saying
thrust
in
thy
sharp
sickle
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
earth
for
her
grapes
are
fully
ripe
14
19
and
the
angel
thrust
in
his
sickle
into
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
earth
and
cast
it
into
the
great
winepress
of
the
wrath
of
god
14
20
and
the
winepress
was
trodden
without
the
city
and
blood
came
out
of
the
winepress
even
unto
the
horse
bridles
by
the
space
of
a
thousand
and
six
hundred
furlongs
15
1
and
i
saw
another
sign
in
heaven
great
and
marvellous
seven
angels
having
the
seven
last
plagues
for
in
them
is
filled
up
the
wrath
of
god
15
2
and
i
saw
as
it
were
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
them
that
had
gotten
the
victory
over
the
beast
and
over
his
image
and
over
his
mark
and
over
the
number
of
his
name
stand
on
the
sea
of
glass
having
the
harps
of
god
15
3
and
they
sing
the
song
of
moses
the
servant
of
god
and
the
song
of
the
lamb
saying
great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works
lord
god
almighty
just
and
true
are
thy
ways
thou
king
of
saints
15
4
who
shall
not
fear
thee
o
lord
and
glorify
thy
name
for
thou
only
art
holy
for
all
nations
shall
come
and
worship
before
thee
for
thy
judgments
are
made
manifest
15
5
and
after
that
i
looked
and
behold
the
temple
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
heaven
was
opened
15
6
and
the
seven
angels
came
out
of
the
temple
having
the
seven
plagues
clothed
in
pure
and
white
linen
and
having
their
breasts
girded
with
golden
girdles
15
7
and
one
of
the
four
beasts
gave
unto
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
vials
full
of
the
wrath
of
god
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
15
8
and
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
from
the
glory
of
god
and
from
his
power
and
no
man
was
able
to
enter
into
the
temple
till
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
fulfilled
16
1
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
saying
to
the
seven
angels
go
your
ways
and
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
earth
16
2
and
the
first
went
and
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
earth
and
there
fell
a
noisome
and
grievous
sore
upon
the
men
which
had
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
upon
them
which
worshipped
his
image
16
3
and
the
second
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sea
and
it
became
as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man
and
every
living
soul
died
in
the
sea
16
4
and
the
third
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
rivers
and
fountains
of
waters
and
they
became
blood
16
5
and
i
heard
the
angel
of
the
waters
say
thou
art
righteous
o
lord
which
art
and
wast
and
shalt
be
because
thou
hast
judged
thus
16
6
for
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
saints
and
prophets
and
thou
hast
given
them
blood
to
drink
for
they
are
worthy
16
7
and
i
heard
another
out
of
the
altar
say
even
so
lord
god
almighty
true
and
righteous
are
thy
judgments
16
8
and
the
fourth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sun
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
scorch
men
with
fire
16
9
and
men
were
scorched
with
great
heat
and
blasphemed
the
name
of
god
which
hath
power
over
these
plagues
and
they
repented
not
to
give
him
glory
16
10
and
the
fifth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
seat
of
the
beast
and
his
kingdom
was
full
of
darkness
and
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
pain
16
11
and
blasphemed
the
god
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
sores
and
repented
not
of
their
deeds
16
12
and
the
sixth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
great
river
euphrates
and
the
water
thereof
was
dried
up
that
the
way
of
the
kings
of
the
east
might
be
prepared
16
13
and
i
saw
three
unclean
spirits
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
dragon
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
beast
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
prophet
16
14
for
they
are
the
spirits
of
devils
working
miracles
which
go
forth
unto
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
of
the
whole
world
to
gather
them
to
the
battle
of
that
great
day
of
god
almighty
16
15
behold
i
come
as
a
thief
blessed
is
he
that
watcheth
and
keepeth
his
garments
lest
he
walk
naked
and
they
see
his
shame
16
16
and
he
gathered
them
together
into
a
place
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
armageddon
16
17
and
the
seventh
angel
poured
out
his
vial
into
the
air
and
there
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
of
heaven
from
the
throne
saying
it
is
done
16
18
and
there
were
voices
and
thunders
and
lightnings
and
there
was
a
great
earthquake
such
as
was
not
since
men
were
upon
the
earth
so
mighty
an
earthquake
and
so
great
16
19
and
the
great
city
was
divided
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
fell
and
great
babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
god
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
16
20
and
every
island
fled
away
and
the
mountains
were
not
found
16
21
and
there
fell
upon
men
a
great
hail
out
of
heaven
every
stone
about
the
weight
of
a
talent
and
men
blasphemed
god
because
of
the
plague
of
the
hail
for
the
plague
thereof
was
exceeding
great
17
1
and
there
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
and
talked
with
me
saying
unto
me
come
hither
i
will
shew
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
waters
17
2
with
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
fornication
17
3
so
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
and
i
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
coloured
beast
full
of
names
of
blasphemy
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
17
4
and
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
colour
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
having
a
golden
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
fornication
17
5
and
upon
her
forehead
was
a
name
written
mystery
babylon
the
great
the
mother
of
harlots
and
abominations
of
the
earth
17
6
and
i
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
jesus
and
when
i
saw
her
i
wondered
with
great
admiration
17
7
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
wherefore
didst
thou
marvel
i
will
tell
thee
the
mystery
of
the
woman
and
of
the
beast
that
carrieth
her
which
hath
the
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
17
8
the
beast
that
thou
sawest
was
and
is
not
and
shall
ascend
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
go
into
perdition
and
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
wonder
whose
names
were
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
when
they
behold
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
and
yet
is
17
9
and
here
is
the
mind
which
hath
wisdom
the
seven
heads
are
seven
mountains
on
which
the
woman
sitteth
17
10
and
there
are
seven
kings
five
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
come
and
when
he
cometh
he
must
continue
a
short
space
17
11
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
even
he
is
the
eighth
and
is
of
the
seven
and
goeth
into
perdition
17
12
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
kings
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
yet
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
hour
with
the
beast
17
13
these
have
one
mind
and
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
beast
17
14
these
shall
make
war
with
the
lamb
and
the
lamb
shall
overcome
them
for
he
is
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
called
and
chosen
and
faithful
17
15
and
he
saith
unto
me
the
waters
which
thou
sawest
where
the
whore
sitteth
are
peoples
and
multitudes
and
nations
and
tongues
17
16
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
beast
these
shall
hate
the
whore
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
naked
and
shall
eat
her
flesh
and
burn
her
with
fire
17
17
for
god
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
will
and
to
agree
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
beast
until
the
words
of
god
shall
be
fulfilled
17
18
and
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
city
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
18
1
and
after
these
things
i
saw
another
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
great
power
and
the
earth
was
lightened
with
his
glory
18
2
and
he
cried
mightily
with
a
strong
voice
saying
babylon
the
great
is
fallen
is
fallen
and
is
become
the
habitation
of
devils
and
the
hold
of
every
foul
spirit
and
a
cage
of
every
unclean
and
hateful
bird
18
3
for
all
nations
have
drunk
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
with
her
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
are
waxed
rich
through
the
abundance
of
her
delicacies
18
4
and
i
heard
another
voice
from
heaven
saying
come
out
of
her
my
people
that
ye
be
not
partakers
of
her
sins
and
that
ye
receive
not
of
her
plagues
18
5
for
her
sins
have
reached
unto
heaven
and
god
hath
remembered
her
iniquities
18
6
reward
her
even
as
she
rewarded
you
and
double
unto
her
double
according
to
her
works
in
the
cup
which
she
hath
filled
fill
to
her
double
18
7
how
much
she
hath
glorified
herself
and
lived
deliciously
so
much
torment
and
sorrow
give
her
for
she
saith
in
her
heart
i
sit
a
queen
and
am
no
widow
and
shall
see
no
sorrow
18
8
therefore
shall
her
plagues
come
in
one
day
death
and
mourning
and
famine
and
she
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
for
strong
is
the
lord
god
who
judgeth
her
18
9
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
who
have
committed
fornication
and
lived
deliciously
with
her
shall
bewail
her
and
lament
for
her
when
they
shall
see
the
smoke
of
her
burning
18
10
standing
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
babylon
that
mighty
city
for
in
one
hour
is
thy
judgment
come
18
11
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
shall
weep
and
mourn
over
her
for
no
man
buyeth
their
merchandise
any
more
18
12
the
merchandise
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
of
pearls
and
fine
linen
and
purple
and
silk
and
scarlet
and

and
the

after
are
departed
from
thee
and
all
things
which
were
dainty
and
goodly
are
departed
from
thee
and
thou
shalt
find
them
no
more
at
all
18
15
the
merchants
of
these
things
which
were
made
rich
by
her
shall
stand
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment
weeping
and
wailing
18
16
and
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
that
was
clothed
in
fine
linen
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
18
17
for
in
one
hour
so
great
riches
is
come
to
nought
and
every
shipmaster
and
all
the
company
in
ships
and
sailors
and
as
many
as
trade
by
sea
stood
afar
off
18
18
and
cried
when
they
saw
the
smoke
of
her
burning
saying
what
city
is
like
unto
this
great
city
18
19
and
they
cast
dust
on
their
heads
and
cried
weeping
and
wailing
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
wherein
were
made
rich
all
that
had
ships
in
the
sea
by
reason
of
her
costliness
for
in
one
hour
is
she
made
desolate
18
20
rejoice
over
her
thou
heaven
and
ye
holy
apostles
and
prophets
for
god
hath
avenged
you
on
her
18
21
and
a
mighty
angel
took
up
a
stone
like
a
great
millstone
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
saying
thus
with
violence
shall
that
great
city
babylon
be
thrown
down
and
shall
be
found
no
more
at
all
18
22
and
the
voice
of
harpers
and
musicians
and
of
pipers
and
trumpeters
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
and
no
craftsman
of
whatsoever
craft
he
be
shall
be
found
any
more
in
thee
and
the
sound
of
a
millstone
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
18
23
and
the
light
of
a
candle
shall
shine
no
more
at
all
in
thee
and
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
of
the
bride
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
for
thy
merchants
were
the
great
men
of
the
earth
for
by
thy
sorceries
were
all
nations
deceived
18
24
and
in
her
was
found
the
blood
of
prophets
and
of
saints
and
of
all
that
were
slain
upon
the
earth
19
1
and
after
these
things
i
heard
a
great
voice
of
much
people
in
heaven
saying
alleluia
salvation
and
glory
and
honour
and
power
unto
the
lord
our
god
19
2
for
true
and
righteous
are
his
judgments
for
he
hath
judged
the
great
whore
which
did
corrupt
the
earth
with
her
fornication
and
hath
avenged
the
blood
of
his
servants
at
her
hand
19
3
and
again
they
said
alleluia
and
her
smoke
rose
up
for
ever
and
ever
19
4
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
and
the
four
beasts
fell
down
and
worshipped
god
that
sat
on
the
throne
saying
amen
alleluia
19
5
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
throne
saying
praise
our
god
all
ye
his
servants
and
ye
that
fear
him
both
small
and
great
19
6
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
voice
of
a
great
multitude
and
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
mighty
thunderings
saying
alleluia
for
the
lord
god
omnipotent
reigneth
19
7
let
us
be
glad
and
rejoice
and
give
honour
to
him
for
the
marriage
of
the
lamb
is
come
and
his
wife
hath
made
herself
ready
19
8
and
to
her
was
granted
that
she
should
be
arrayed
in
fine
linen
clean
and
white
for
the
fine
linen
is
the
righteousness
of
saints
19
9
and
he
saith
unto
me
write
blessed
are
they
which
are
called
unto
the
marriage
supper
of
the
lamb
and
he
saith
unto
me
these
are
the
true
sayings
of
god
19
10
and
i
fell
at
his
feet
to
worship
him
and
he
said
unto
me
see
thou
do
it
not
i
am
thy
fellowservant
and
of
thy
brethren
that
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
worship
god
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
19
11
and
i
saw
heaven
opened
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
upon
him
was
called
faithful
and
true
and
in
righteousness
he
doth
judge
and
make
war
19
12
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
on
his
head
were
many
crowns
and
he
had
a
name
written
that
no
man
knew
but
he
himself
19
13
and
he
was
clothed
with
a
vesture
dipped
in
blood
and
his
name
is
called
the
word
of
god
19
14
and
the
armies
which
were
in
heaven
followed
him
upon
white
horses
clothed
in
fine
linen
white
and
clean
19
15
and
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
sharp
sword
that
with
it
he
should
smite
the
nations
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
he
treadeth
the
winepress
of
the
fierceness
and
wrath
of
almighty
god
19
16
and
he
hath
on
his
vesture
and
on
his
thigh
a
name
written
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
19
17
and
i
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
to
all
the
fowls
that
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
come
and
gather
yourselves
together
unto
the
supper
of
the
great
god
19
18
that
ye
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
and
the
flesh
of
captains
and
the
flesh
of
mighty
men
and
the
flesh
of
horses
and
of
them
that
sit
on
them
and
the
flesh
of
all
men
both
free
and
bond
both
small
and
great
19
19
and
i
saw
the
beast
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
their
armies
gathered
together
to
make
war
against
him
that
sat
on
the
horse
and
against
his
army
19
20
and
the
beast
was
taken
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
that
wrought
miracles
before
him
with
which
he
deceived
them
that
had
received
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
them
that
worshipped
his
image
these
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone
19
21
and
the
remnant
were
slain
with
the
sword
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
horse
which
sword
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
and
all
the
fowls
were
filled
with
their
flesh
20
1
and
i
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
20
2
and
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon
that
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
and
satan
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years
20
3
and
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
and
shut
him
up
and
set
a
seal
upon
him
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled
and
after
that
he
must
be
loosed
a
little
season
20
4
and
i
saw
thrones
and
they
sat
upon
them
and
judgment
was
given
unto
them
and
i
saw
the
souls
of
them
that
were
beheaded
for
the
witness
of
jesus
and
for
the
word
of
god
and
which
had
not
worshipped
the
beast
neither
his
image
neither
had
received
his
mark
upon
their
foreheads
or
in
their
hands
and
they
lived
and
reigned
with
christ
a
thousand
years
20
5
but
the
rest
of
the
dead
lived
not
again
until
the
thousand
years
were
finished
this
is
the
first
resurrection
20
6
blessed
and
holy
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
but
they
shall
be
priests
of
god
and
of
christ
and
shall
reign
with
him
a
thousand
years
20
7
and
when
the
thousand
years
are
expired
satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison
20
8
and
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
which
are
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
gog
and
magog
to
gather
them
together
to
battle
the
number
of
whom
is
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
20
9
and
they
went
up
on
the
breadth
of
the
earth
and
compassed
the
camp
of
the
saints
about
and
the
beloved
city
and
fire
came
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
and
devoured
them
20
10
and
the
devil
that
deceived
them
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
the
beast
and
the
false
prophet
are
and
shall
be
tormented
day
and
night
for
ever
and
ever
20
11
and
i
saw
a
great
white
throne
and
him
that
sat
on
it
from
whose
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
fled
away
and
there
was
found
no
place
for
them
20
12
and
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
and
the
books
were
opened
and
another
book
was
opened
which
is
the
book
of
life
and
the
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books
according
to
their
works
20
13
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
their
works
20
14
and
death
and
hell
were
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
this
is
the
second
death
20
15
and
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
21
1
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
and
there
was
no
more
sea
21
2
and
i
john
saw
the
holy
city
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
21
3
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
behold
the
tabernacle
of
god
is
with
men
and
he
will
dwell
with
them
and
they
shall
be
his
people
and
god
himself
shall
be
with
them
and
be
their
god
21
4
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
21
5
and
he
that
sat
upon
the
throne
said
behold
i
make
all
things
new
and
he
said
unto
me
write
for
these
words
are
true
and
faithful
21
6
and
he
said
unto
me
it
is
done
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
i
will
give
unto
him
that
is
athirst
of
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
life
freely
21
7
he
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
and
i
will
be
his
god
and
he
shall
be
my
son
21
8
but
the
fearful
and
unbelieving
and
the
abominable
and
murderers
and
whoremongers
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
all
liars
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
second
death
21
9
and
there
came
unto
me
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
full
of
the
seven
last
plagues
and
talked
with
me
saying
come
hither
i
will
shew
thee
the
bride
the
lamb’s
wife
21
10
and
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
to
a
great
and
high
mountain
and
shewed
me
that
great
city
the
holy
jerusalem
descending
out
of
heaven
from
god
21
11
having
the
glory
of
god
and
her
light
was
like
unto
a
stone
most
precious
even
like
a
jasper
stone
clear
as
crystal
21
12
and
had
a
wall
great
and
high
and
had
twelve
gates
and
at
the
gates
twelve
angels
and
names
written
thereon
which
are
the
names
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
21
13
on
the
east
three
gates
on
the
north
three
gates
on
the
south
three
gates
and
on
the
west
three
gates
21
14
and
the
wall
of
the
city
had
twelve
foundations
and
in
them
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
21
15
and
he
that
talked
with
me
had
a
golden
reed
to
measure
the
city
and
the
gates
thereof
and
the
wall
thereof
21
16
and
the
city
lieth
foursquare
and
the
length
is
as
large
as
the
breadth
and

according

and
the

and
i
saw
no
temple
therein
for
the
lord
god
almighty
and
the
lamb
are
the
temple
of
it
21
23
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god

earth
do
bring

glory
and
honour
into
it
21
25
and

it
shall
not
be
shut
at
all
by
day
for
there
shall
be
no
night
there
21
26
and
they
shall
bring
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
nations
into
it
21
27
and
there
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
it
any
thing
that
defileth
neither
whatsoever
worketh
abomination
or
maketh
a
lie
but
they
which
are
written
in
the
lamb’s
book
of
life
22
1
and
he
shewed
me
a
pure
river
of
water
of
life
clear
as
crystal
proceeding
out
of
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
22
2
in
the
midst
of
the
street
of
it
and
on
either
side
of
the
river
was
there
the
tree
of
life
which
bare
twelve
manner
of
fruits
and
yielded
her
fruit
every
month
and
the
leaves
of
the
tree
were
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
22

and
there
shall
be
no
more
curse
but
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
shall
be
in
it
and
his
servants
shall
serve
him
22
4
and
they
shall
see
his
face
and
his
name
shall
be
in
their
foreheads
22
5
and
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
need
no
candle
neither
light
of
the
sun
for
the
lord
god
giveth
them
light
and
they
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
22
6
and
he
said
unto
me
these
sayings
are
faithful
and
true
and
the
lord
god
of
the
holy
prophets
sent
his
angel
to
shew
unto
his
servants
the
things
which
must
shortly
be
done
22
7
behold
i
come
quickly
blessed
is
he
that

the
sayings
of
the
prophecy
of

these
things
and
heard
them
and
when
i
had

fell
down
to
worship
before
the
feet
of
the
angel
which
shewed
me
these
things
22
9
then
saith
he
unto
me
see
thou
do
it
not
for

unto
me

book
for

time

22
11
he
that

unjust
let
him
be
unjust
still
and
he
which
is
filthy
let
him
be
filthy
still
and
he
that
is
righteous
let
him
be
righteous
still
and
he
that
is
holy
let
him
be
holy
still
22
12
and
behold
i
come
quickly
and
my
reward
is
with
me
to
give
every
man
according
as
his
work
shall
be
22
13
i
am
alpha
and
omega

beginning
and
the
end

last
22
14
blessed

his
commandments
that
they
may
have
right
to
the
tree
of
life
and
may
enter
in
through
the
gates
into
the
city

and
murderers
and
idolaters
and

loveth
and
maketh
a
lie

him
that

athirst
come
and
whosoever
will
let
him
take
the
water
of
life
freely
22
18
for

prophecy
of
this
book
if

add
unto
these
things

add
unto
him
the
plagues
that

book
22
19
and
if
any
man
shall
take
away
from
the
words
of
the
book
of
this
prophecy

take
away
his
part
out
of
