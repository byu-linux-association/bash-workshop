# For this task, we have provided the Bible as a list of newline spaced words.
# This file is bible.txt
# You should write a shell pipeline that finds the 10 most common words in the Bible and their count.
#
# Hint: cat, uniq, sort, and head are your friends. Use the man command (`man cat`) or look online.
# Also, always sort before using uniq
